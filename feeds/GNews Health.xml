                                        &lt;p&gt;In the world of complicated fitness plans, there is one exercise that never goes out of style - walking. There is a new walking routine going viral these days. 6-6-6 walking routine has been making rounds on social media lately, and for the right reasons. This simple exercise can help you keep yourself fit, primarily because it helps you shed the extra kilos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is no shortage of fitness challenges on social media, the 6-6-6 walking routine has gained traction. Here's everything you need to know about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is The 6-6-6 Walking Routine? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/666-walking-trend-weight-loss" rel="noindex,nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Healthline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the 6-6-6 walking routine is a workout that involves "walking for 60 minutes, either at 6 a.m. or 6 p.m. It additionally includes a 6-minute warm-up at a slow pace to help you ease into walking and a 6-minute cool-down to aid in recovery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a workout, the 6-6-6 routine is more like a lifestyle shift that activates your metabolism, promotes heart health, and aids in weight management - all while being gentle to your joints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-personalisation---lifestyle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;em&gt;&lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html" rel="noindex,nofollow"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; states that at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week is required to stay healthy, which includes moderate-intensity workouts such as brisk walking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is a great exercise and can help reduce mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression, as per &lt;em&gt;Healthline&lt;/em&gt;. It is also believed that it can help you lose weight, control blood pressure levels, increase energy levels, boost memory, strengthen bones, and reduce the chances of developing chronic diseases such as diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it may offer benefits, make sure you check with your doctor before you incorporate a new workout regimen in your routine.&lt;/p&gt;

found a direct link between exposure to wildfire smoke and a sharp rise in dementia diagnoses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings raise new concerns about the long-term neurological impacts of worsening air quality fueled by increasingly severe wildfires. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, about 42 percent of Americans over 55 are expected to develop dementia, with annual cases &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14279053/Americans-dementia-disease-underestimated.html"&gt;projected to nearly double from 514,000 in 2020 to one million by 2060&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers pinpointed wildfire smoke as especially harmful because it contains tiny toxic particles known as PM2.5, microscopic pollutants roughly 30 times thinner than a human hair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike typical city smog or car exhaust, t&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14765103/air-quality-canada-wildfires-michigan-minnesota-wisconsin.html"&gt;hese particles can enter the bloodstream &lt;/a&gt;and travel to the brain, causing inflammation that increases the risk of memory loss and cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PM2.5 particles can also weaken the blood-brain barrier, the brain's protective shield, making it vulnerable to damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14907953/air-quality-emergency-new-york-michigan-minnesota-illinois-vermont.html"&gt;Amid one of the most intense wildfire seasons on record&lt;/a&gt;, over 4,000 fires scorching nearly 200,000 acres in California as of mid-July 2025, this threat is growing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A new study reveals that wildfire smoke, is directly linked to a sharp rise in dementia diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wildfire smoke is an unpredictable and highly toxic mix of burned vegetation, plastics, metals, and chemicals from destroyed homes and vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It forms at higher temperatures and lingers longer in the air, making it far more damaging per microgram than pollution from factories or traffic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study found that a mere one-microgram increase in wildfire-related PM2.5 per cubic meter of air raises the risk of a dementia diagnosis by 21 percent over three years, nearly 20 times the risk posed by the same amount of PM2.5 from other pollution sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Holly Elser, neurologist and lead author from the University of Pennsylvania, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6048497/California-wildfire-smoke-set-cause-lung-issues-nationwide.html"&gt;said, 'Air pollution from wildfires now makes up more than 70 percent of total PM2.5 on poor air quality days in California.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These findings highlight the urgent need for stronger wildfire prevention policies and better smoke mitigation strategies.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To measure long-term exposure, researchers combined satellite data with ground air quality monitors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, focused on cognitively healthy individuals over 60 and controlled for income, smoking, health conditions, and race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As wildfires worsen, experts warn that addressing this silent threat is critical to protecting brain health for millions of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-gramm="false"&gt;By mid-July 2025, over 4,000 fires had already burned nearly 200,000 acres in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also found the worst health effects in low-income and minority communities, groups more likely to live in high-smoke areas and less likely to have access to indoor air filtration or protective equipment like N95 masks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Joan Casey, a senior author of the study and assistant professor in the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences at the University of Washington, Seattle: 'These findings underscore that clinical and health policies seeking to prevent dementia-associated disparities should include efforts to reduce exposure to long-term wildfire and non-wildfire PM2.5.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For decades, pollution has been linked to heart and lung disease, but this study adds to growing evidence that it also harms the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Claire Sexton of the Alzheimer's Association, said: 'We've thought about pollution as a lung and heart issue for decades, but now we are seeing its effects on memory, cognition, and aging, and it's deeply troubling.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As wildfire seasons stretch longer, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-11426259/Americas-growing-wildfire-crisis-lead-wave-health-issues-years-come-heres-why.html"&gt;sometimes from May through December, and heatwaves worsen&lt;/a&gt; across the western US, scientists warned that the neurological impact of poor air quality could be the next major public health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended staying indoors on days when the Air Quality Index (AQI) hits 100 or higher, using high-efficiency furnace filters (rated MERV 13 or above), and wearing certified N95 masks if outdoor exposure is unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These warnings come as the overall risk of dementia continues to rise nationwide. A separate study published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://archive.is/TmLlJ#selection-1135.0-1147.448"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt; estimated a 42 percent lifetime risk of developing dementia after age 55, with rates especially high among Black Americans.

							&lt;p&gt;The cat who changed everything arrived during the second year of lockdown, when touch had become dangerous and algorithms determined who we could love. Tom found her—a tortoiseshell with one white paw—behind a dumpster in Queens, brought her home to the apartment he shared with Sarah, and named her Mochi. Within a week, she'd chosen Sarah completely, definitively, with the kind of certainty that dating apps promise but never deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Tom kneels on their kitchen floor at 6 AM, holding salmon treats in one hand and speaking in the high-pitched voice we reserve for creatures we desperately want to love us back. Mochi sits perfectly still, green eyes locked not on him but on the doorway where Sarah will eventually appear. When she does—hair messy, still in pajamas—the cat transforms. Stone becomes water. Mochi flows between Sarah's legs, purring like something mechanical and necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"She hates me," Tom says, not for the first time, dropping the rejected treats back in the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah scoops up Mochi, who immediately nestles into her collarbone. "She doesn't hate you."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we all know what Tom knows: in a world where we swipe through faces hoping for mutual selection, where algorithms sort us into desirable and undesirable, where even our cats seem to have standards we can't meet, rejection hits different now. Mochi has made her choice with the kind of absoluteness that no amount of data science can replicate. And it wasn't him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The algorithm of the heart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started collecting these stories after Tom first told me about Mochi, and they're everywhere once you start looking. The golden retriever at my local dog park who walks past his owner to follow a stranger who resembles his first human. My neighbor's African grey parrot who learned thirty words from their daughter but remains silent when anyone else approaches. The therapy dog who, despite training that should make him love everyone equally, spends every free moment beside one particular resident at the nursing home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want simple explanations: whoever feeds the pet becomes the favorite, or animals prefer whoever spends the most time with them. But the evidence tells a different story. Tom feeds Mochi every morning. He plays with her, cleans her litter box, paid the vet bills for that eye infection last spring. By any algorithmic measure—time invested, resources provided, care demonstrated—he should be her chosen person. Yet Mochi waits by the door each evening for Sarah, who works sixty-hour weeks and sometimes doesn't get home until after the cat's bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes this particularly resonant now is how it mirrors our broader cultural moment. Young adults navigating dating apps report that rejection sensitivity—the tendency to anxiously expect, readily perceive, and intensely react to rejection—has become a defining feature of modern romance. We've gamified love, turned it into a series of binary decisions, yes or no, swipe left or swipe right. But animals don't swipe. They just know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom tells me he's started thinking of Mochi's preference as "analog rejection"—no ghosting, no mixed signals, no "it's not you, it's me." Just clear, consistent choice. "In a weird way, it's almost refreshing," he says. "At least I know where I stand."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The biology of being chosen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what actually happens when Mochi sees Sarah: both of their brains release oxytocin, the same hormone that bonds mothers to infants. When researchers at Azabu University in Japan studied &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1261022"&gt;dog-human interactions&lt;/a&gt;, they discovered this interspecies oxytocin loop—mutual gazing increased the hormone in both parties by up to 300%, creating what scientists call a "positive feedback loop" of attachment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But oxytocin isn't just about creating bonds; it's about creating &lt;em&gt;selective&lt;/em&gt; bonds. &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1322868111"&gt;Research from Duke University's Canine Cognition Center&lt;/a&gt; found that when dogs were given oxytocin, they didn't become indiscriminately affectionate. Instead, the hormone made them more discerning, increasing their preference for people who matched their energy and emotional state. Female dogs, in particular, showed heightened selectivity—choosing to gaze longer at their owners while becoming more wary of strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This selectivity operates below conscious awareness. A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93922-1"&gt;2021 study comparing pet dogs with pack-living dogs and wolves&lt;/a&gt;revealed that only household pets showed oxytocin spikes during human interaction. Despite being hand-raised by humans, pack animals maintained their own social hierarchies. The difference? Pet dogs live embedded in our daily rhythms, sharing our schedules, our spaces, our emotional weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom's anxiety about being rejected—his tentative approaches, his slight tension when he reaches for Mochi—may actually be pushing her toward Sarah's calmer presence. Studies of attachment in shelter animals show that &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5451941/"&gt;cats and dogs are remarkably attuned to human stress signals&lt;/a&gt;, often preferring people whose cortisol levels are lower. The science suggests our pets aren't just choosing who they like best; they're choosing who makes them feel most regulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I used to think I was doing everything right," Tom says. "But maybe trying so hard was exactly what I was doing wrong."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The certainty crisis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah works in user experience design, building the invisible architectures that guide our choices online. When I ask her about Mochi's preference, she laughs. "At work, we spend millions trying to predict and influence user behavior. We A/B test button colors, optimize conversion funnels, build machine learning models to anticipate what people want before they know they want it. Then I come home to this cat who decided within three days that I was her person, based on... what? My smell? The way I didn't try too hard? Some ineffable cat algorithm we'll never decode?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She's touching on something profound about our current moment. Dating app algorithms now sort potential matches based on everything from facial symmetry to linguistic patterns in our profiles—while claiming to connect people based on deeper compatibility. The very platforms designed to reduce the uncertainty of romantic connection have instead amplified it. Every match might be the algorithm manipulating you. Every rejection might be the code deciding you're not optimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mochi's choice feels different precisely because it's illegible to our optimization-obsessed age. There's no API for a cat's affection, no way to hack your way into being chosen. This illegibility feels like resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During lockdown, when everyone's cortisol levels were spiking, this regulatory function became even more crucial. Pets weren't just companions; they were co-regulation partners. And like all intimate relationships, the match had to be right. Chemistry, even between species, can't be forced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The privilege of rejection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend who works at a Brooklyn shelter tells me the saddest stories involve returns. "Someone adopts a dog, expecting instant love, and when the dog bonds with their roommate or their kid instead, they bring it back. As if the animal failed some test." She pauses. "The weird thing is, these are often the same people who complain about dating apps being superficial. They want authentic connection but can't handle when authentic connection doesn't choose them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's a darker edge to these dynamics that becomes visible when you look across economic lines. Research on pet ownership during economic hardship reveals that financially stressed pet owners are more likely to risk their own health and safety for their animals, especially when the bond is strong. The same connection that provides comfort can become a vulnerability when resources are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom and Sarah can afford to find Mochi's rejection amusing, even endearing. They have the economic cushion to treat it as a quirky household dynamic rather than a source of genuine distress. But for someone who's lost everything else—job, home, human relationships—being rejected by the creature you've saved can hit different. The very intensity of human-animal bonds means they carry real stakes, and those stakes aren't equally distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I volunteer at the shelter sometimes," Tom tells me. "You see people who have nothing, whose dog is everything to them. If that dog preferred someone else? I don't think they could laugh it off like I do."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learning from the unchosen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months after our first conversation, something has shifted in Tom and Sarah's apartment. Tom no longer approaches Mochi with treats and desperate hope. He simply exists in the space, reading on the couch while she sits on Sarah's lap. And sometimes—not often, but sometimes—Mochi walks across the couch to sniff his book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I stopped trying to make her love me," Tom says. "I figured if I rescued her, gave her a good home, that should be enough. Even if she picked Sarah as her person."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irony is that this acceptance has actually improved their relationship. Without the pressure of Tom's expectations, Mochi has begun to show small signs of acknowledgment—a slow blink here, a brief head bump there. Research on feline behavior suggests that cats are more likely to approach humans who ignore them, a phenomenon that &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6826447/"&gt;Japanese researchers call the "cat paradox"&lt;/a&gt;. She'll never be his cat the way she's Sarah's cat, but she's beginning to recognize him as part of her chosen person's pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift in Tom's approach mirrors something larger about how we might navigate connection in an algorithmic age. "I've stopped taking it personally," he tells me. "Like, genuinely stopped. And weirdly, that's made me think differently about online dating too. Some matches won't text back, some cats won't choose you, and that's just... how choice works."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beyond the algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories I've collected reveal patterns that resist datafication. The elderly woman whose cat hides from everyone except the grocery delivery person who reminds him of his first owner. The couple whose dog chose their neighbor, leading to a joint custody arrangement that became a friendship none of them expected. The child whose hamster will only eat when she's in the room, a preference so specific it reorganized the family's entire dinner routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These choices create what Sarah calls "desire paths"—the routes worn by actual use rather than planned design. In UX, desire paths show where users actually want to go, regardless of where designers thought they should go. Mochi's preference carved a desire path through their household, reorganizing the emotional landscape in ways no amount of planning could have predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent neuroscience research suggests these preferences might be encoded at levels we're only beginning to understand. A &lt;a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-022-04199-1"&gt;2023 study on interspecies attachment&lt;/a&gt; found that animals form mental maps of their social world as complex as our own, with preferred individuals occupying privileged positions in their cognitive geography. When Mochi chose Sarah, she wasn't just selecting a food provider—she was mapping her emotional universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The gift of arbitrary love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is what we're actually seeking when we talk about authentic connection: not the guarantee of being chosen, but the reality of choice itself. In a world where algorithms increasingly mediate our relationships, where machine learning tries to predict compatibility based on data points, the arbitrary certainty of an animal's preference feels like resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom and Sarah's apartment has become a living experiment in acceptance. Mochi still waits by the door for Sarah. She still purrs louder when Sarah holds her. But she also now acknowledges Tom as part of her territory, someone worthy of the occasional head bump, the rare slow blink that cat behaviorists call a "kitty kiss."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You know what's changed most?" Tom reflects. "I'm not performing for her anymore. I'm just... here. And apparently, that's enough for her to occasionally remember I exist."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This opacity might be the real gift our pets offer us. In an age of radical transparency, where our preferences are tracked, stored, analyzed, and sold, the mystery of animal choice remains uncolonized by data. We can't A/B test our way to a cat's affection or optimize our way into a dog's heart. We can only be present, patient, and open to the possibility that love—real love—doesn't always choose us back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pets in our homes are running ancient software on hardware refined by millions of years of evolution. When Mochi chose Sarah, she wasn't making a decision based on optimization or compatibility scores. She was responding to something older than algorithms, deeper than data, more mysterious than any machine learning model we've yet built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that's why these stories of animal favoritism captivate us now more than ever. They remind us that in a world of manufactured connections and predicted preferences, some choices remain wild. Arbitrary. Absolute. Even if we're not the ones chosen, we get to witness choice itself—pure, inexplicable, and certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time you see a pet clearly playing favorites, resist the urge to take it personally. Instead, marvel at what you're witnessing: millions of years of evolution culminating in this precise moment, when one small mammal looks at one specific human and says, in all the ways they can: "You. It's you."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if it's not you, there's something profound in being present for that choosing—in seeing love declare itself, mysterious and sure, in a world that's forgotten what certainty feels like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were nearly 70,000 cases of uterine cancer in 2024, &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/corp.html" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7914767" data-affiliate="true"&gt;according to the National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uterine cancer involves cancer of what many folks think of as the womb, “or the place where a pregnancy is housed and grows,” said &lt;a href="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/ami-p-vaidya/1318087" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7914767" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Ami Vaidya&lt;/a&gt;, a gynecological cancer doctor at Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The uterus has two components; there’s a muscle wall and there’s a lining, an inner portion of the uterus that consists of glandular tissue,” Vaidya explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And I mentioned these two different areas because very different cancers can start in the two different areas of the uterus,” she noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s more common to see cancer in the lining, which is known as endometrial cancer, Vaidya said. “And although there are several different types within that category, as a group, that is more common than the cancers that can start in the muscle wall — the cancers that start in the muscle wall are called sarcomas or leiomyosarcomas,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foundationforwomenscancer.org/gynecologic-cancers/gynecologic-cancer-types/uterine-endometrial-cancer-gtd/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7914767" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Uterine cancer&lt;/a&gt; rates are rising, said &lt;a href="https://www.medstarhealth.org/doctors/ebony-r-hoskins-md" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7914767" data-affiliate="true"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Ebony Hoskins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a gynecologic oncologist in Washington, D.C., and member of the &lt;a href="https://www.sgo.org/about-sgo/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7914767" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Society of Gynecologic Oncology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rates of endometrial cancer, specifically, have actually surpassed ovarian cancer rates. This makes it the most common GYN cancer in the country, Hoskins added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly 12,000 people die of ovarian cancer each year, while more than 13,000 die of endometrial cancer, said Hoskins.

							&lt;p&gt;Have you ever found yourself in a conversation where the other person just won't look at you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe they're staring at their phone, gazing out the window, or studying their shoes like they're the most fascinating thing in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unsettling, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your mind starts racing—Are they bored?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiding something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I say something wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think people who avoided eye contact were just being rude or disinterested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after diving into the psychology behind this behavior, I realized there's usually much more going on beneath the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, when someone can't meet your gaze, their brain is often working overtime—processing emotions, managing stress, or navigating complex social dynamics that have nothing to do with you personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding what's really happening in those moments can completely shift how you interpret these interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's explore the eight most common thoughts running through someone's mind when they're looking everywhere but at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They're feeling socially anxious about being judged&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever notice how some people seem to shrink away during conversations, their eyes darting anywhere but your face?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a good chance they're battling social anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted by researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/news/2023/04/why-avoid-my-gaze"&gt;Universiteit Leiden&lt;/a&gt;, people high in social anxiety avoid eye contact in real-life conversations to dial down feared negative evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it—when you're worried about being judged, direct eye contact can feel incredibly vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's like opening a window to your soul when you'd rather keep the curtains drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their averted gaze isn't about you being intimidating or uninteresting. Instead, they're trying to create a buffer zone where they feel safer and less exposed to potential criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They're trying to hide a lie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that time you asked your teenager where they were last night and suddenly they became fascinated with the kitchen counter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, there's solid psychology behind this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that liars are more likely to avert their gaze, and forcing eye contact actually &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/let-their-words-do-the-talking/202009/3-simple-techniques-detect-deception"&gt;boosts lie detection&lt;/a&gt;—suggesting gaze avoidance is a sneaky self-protection move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone is being deceptive, maintaining eye contact feels risky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's like they instinctively know that their eyes might give them away, so they look elsewhere to maintain their story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everyone who avoids eye contact is lying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you notice this behavior combined with other signs like fidgeting or inconsistent details, their mind might be working overtime to keep their deception intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They're feeling ashamed or embarrassed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something particularly vulnerable about eye contact when you're carrying shame or embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about the last time you had to admit a mistake to someone, or when you were caught off-guard by a question about something you'd rather not discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your instinct was probably to look down or away, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shame has a way of making us want to hide, and avoiding eye contact is one of the most immediate ways to create that sense of concealment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's like their brain is saying, "If I can't see the judgment in your eyes, maybe it's not really there."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This response is deeply human and often automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone feels exposed or regretful about something, looking away becomes a protective mechanism—a way to maintain some dignity while they process their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They're showing you respect according to their cultural background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's something that completely changed my perspective on eye contact: what feels rude to you might actually be a sign of deep respect to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-cultural research found that in some East Asian and Caribbean cultures, sustained eye contact is &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2015/02/the-impact-of-making-eye-contact-around-the-world/"&gt;considered rude&lt;/a&gt;, so people avert their gaze to show respect—not disinterest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this the hard way during my corporate days when I misinterpreted a colleague's behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought she was being dismissive during our meetings because she rarely looked directly at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, I discovered that in her culture, maintaining eye contact with authority figures or during serious conversations was seen as confrontational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a humbling reminder that our social norms aren't universal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What feels like avoidance to you might actually be their way of honoring the conversation and showing you the utmost courtesy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the most respectful thing someone can do is look away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They're feeling overwhelmed by the intensity of the moment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes avoiding eye contact isn't about what someone is thinking—it's about what they're feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been in a conversation that felt too heavy, too emotional, or just too much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe someone was sharing deeply personal news, or you were having one of those heart-to-heart talks that cuts straight to the core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In moments like these, direct eye contact can feel like staring into a spotlight when you're already feeling exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emotional intensity becomes almost too much to bear, so looking away provides a necessary breather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not that they don't care about what you're saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it might be the opposite—they care so much that they need to create some emotional distance just to stay present in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it as their way of regulating their feelings so they can actually absorb what's happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They're distracted by something else entirely&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's be honest—sometimes the reason has nothing to do with psychology and everything to do with a wandering mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe they're mentally rehearsing an important presentation they have later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they're worried about a family situation or trying to remember if they locked the front door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe that notification sound from their phone completely derailed their train of thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a world full of distractions, and our brains aren't always great at compartmentalizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone's mind is elsewhere, maintaining eye contact becomes surprisingly difficult because they're not fully present in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't necessarily mean they don't value your conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might just mean they're human, dealing with the same mental juggling act we all face daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They need mental space to process something difficult&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever noticed how people look up at the ceiling when you ask them a tough question?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or how they stare off into the distance when trying to remember something important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't absent-mindedness—it's actually their brain being incredibly smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiments showed that adults (and even 8-year-olds) look away when &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03195338.pdf"&gt;answering tough questions&lt;/a&gt; because averting gaze frees up mental bandwidth for problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of eye contact as mentally demanding. When someone is trying to work through a complex thought, calculate something in their head, or recall a specific memory, their brain needs all available resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking away is like closing unnecessary browser tabs on a computer—it frees up processing power for the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if someone breaks eye contact mid-conversation, they might just be giving your question the thoughtful attention it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. They're trying to maintain emotional boundaries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people avoid eye contact as a way of protecting their emotional space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might happen when they're going through something difficult and don't want to invite questions or concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe they're in a professional setting where they need to keep things business-focused rather than personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eye contact creates connection, but not everyone is ready for that level of connection in every moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking away can be their way of saying, "I'm here, I'm participating, but I need to keep some walls up right now."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not necessarily about rejecting you or the conversation. Instead, it might be about self-preservation—maintaining the emotional energy they need to get through their day without becoming too vulnerable or invested in every interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time someone avoids eye contact with you, take a deep breath before jumping to conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More often than not, their wandering gaze has absolutely nothing to do with you and everything to do with what's happening in their internal world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether they're managing anxiety, processing complex thoughts, or simply navigating their own cultural norms, there's usually a very human reason behind the behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This awareness has completely changed how I approach these situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of feeling rejected or wondering what I did wrong, I try to extend a little grace and patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I'll even adjust my own approach—maybe I'll speak a bit more gently if I sense anxiety, or give them extra time to think if they seem to be wrestling with something difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the psychology behind eye contact avoidance doesn't just make us better communicators—it makes us more compassionate people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in a world where we're quick to misinterpret each other's actions, that's something we could all use a little more of.&lt;/p&gt;

It can lead to long COVID, hospitalization and even death,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“COVID is dangerous, and particularly dangerous for folks who have immunosuppression, other chronic medical illnesses, or people who are older, and these medications can help reduce those risks,” Coles added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COVID symptoms can look a lot like the symptoms of other upper respiratory infections, which makes testing important.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think with every new variant, there is this narrative that suggests that we could tell if someone has COVID based on their symptoms, and that the symptoms are significantly different or unique, but all in all, they appear to be undistinguishable from any other upper respiratory infection,” Harmony said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, congestion can happen whether it’s COVID or a cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would encourage everyone to test if you’re symptomatic,” added Coles.

And, again, if you’re high-risk or have concerning symptoms, get medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are several things you can do to stay healthy, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep yourself from getting infected, “wear a high-quality mask, like an N95, in crowded indoor places ... wash [your] hands regularly and make sure that the folks around [you] are feeling well,” Coles said, and added that if a loved one tells you they have the sniffles, consider rescheduling that get-together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before all of those preventative measures, make sure you have the latest COVID shot. “Vaccination is still, by far, the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones,” said Coles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who are at high risk of developing COVID can get a second dose of the current COVID vaccine to stay protected during the current summer increase in cases, Coles noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Only after I’ve guaranteed his anonymity — Jeff is not his real name — does he share the whole story: “I was in my early-to-mid-30s, and there was significant bleeding from my &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/12/the-year-i-spent-with-my-butt-out.html"&gt;butt&lt;/a&gt; after a bowel movement.” That had never happened before, and Jeff had no idea &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it was happening. Panicked, he raced to the ER. “They told me I had internal hemorrhoids and one had become inflamed,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7yrjy001o3b79ogibo4ls@published" data-word-count="187"&gt;In a sense, we all have hemorrhoids. The term refers to both the anal ailment and the anatomy it affects: the cushiony rings of veins that line the anal canal and swell and expand to prevent stool from leaking before we’re ready to release it. “You can also think of them like a gasket in an engine or a rubber ring in a water faucet,” says &lt;a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/sanghyun-a-kim"&gt;Dr. Sanghyun Kim&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of surgery at the Icahn School of Medicine and site chief of colon and rectal surgery at Mount Sinai. When hemorrhoids are taxed beyond their limit — from too much pressure — they swell &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much, bulging like a kinked hose. That’s when hemorrhoids become varicose veins in your butt (or just outside it). And they are ubiquitous. “I would say we are absolutely seeing an increased incidence in hemorrhoids,” says &lt;a href="https://weillcornell.org/feliceschnoll"&gt;Dr. Felice Schnoll-Sussman&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Jay Monahan Center for Gastrointestinal Health at NewYork-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine, who explained that since the recommended age for a first &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2021/11/president-kamala-harris.html"&gt;colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt; was recently changed from 50 to 45, more people are being diagnosed with them than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn9w016000m3b78wn4w51uz@published" data-word-count="85"&gt;Research shows that one in three people in America who undergo a colonoscopy are diagnosed with hemorrhoids and that hemorrhoids account for 4 million doctor’s-office and emergency-room visits annually. Doctors expect this number to continue to rise. It’s estimated that at least &lt;a href="https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/us-hemorrhoids-treatment-market-16261?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;$1.7 billion&lt;/a&gt; is spent on medical hemorrhoid treatments each year, a figure projected to increase another billion dollars by 2034. (In 2017, sales of Preparation H — which can temporarily ease hemorrhoid pain but does not solve the problem — totaled &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7075634/#R7"&gt;$136 million&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdnafm8t001n3b78bsd7giea@published" data-word-count="102"&gt;Given the nightmare health scenarios that bloody stool can portend (colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease), a diagnosis of hemorrhoids was a relief for Jeff. He vowed to stop reading on the toilet (which he’d done all his life and which he was told may have caused his hemorrhoids) and to eat more fiber and drink more water so as to strain less. A bowel movement should occur swiftly and effortlessly; some experts &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-long-should-it-take-you-to-have-a-bowel-movement"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; it should take no more than &lt;a href="https://www.healthpartners.com/blog/healthy-poop-chart/"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; minutes. Back before his Trump-toadying days, Dr. Mehmet Oz famously &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/02/04/the-operator"&gt;remarked&lt;/a&gt; that poop should hit the bowl “like a diver from Acapulco.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7yrm0001q3b79mpy0z2x0@published" data-word-count="232"&gt;Typically, this is where a hemorrhoid story ends. If your only symptom is occasional blood or intermittent discomfort, doctors often advise that after getting checked out, you wait for things to improve on their own, which they generally do. This is how things transpired for Lana (also not her real name) after she noticed “some minor itchiness and then a weird lump” along with “blood in my poop.” Her doctor told her, “Oh, you probably have hemorrhoids; if they don’t bother you, don’t worry about it.” She made some lifestyle changes, though she admits that toilet-scrolling remained a treasured pastime (“Because phones are interesting,” she tells me). Meanwhile, Jeff hewed to his doctor’s counsel: “Lots of fiber, lots of hydration. Just doing everything I could,” he says. But hemorrhoids are mercurial menaces — sometimes easily vanquished, sometimes not. Though Lana was lax and Jeff meticulous, her hemorrhoids resolved while his persisted, eventually causing him brutal pain on top of the bloody mess he would ashamedly clean up each time he moved his bowels. On Reddit, many others have shared their private ordeals with their own intractable hemorrhoids. “Is anybody else severely depressed because of these things?” one &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/1liwi6x/anybody_else/"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; in r/hemorrhoid. Another answered, “It’s all I think about all day.” A woman going by u/misssorebutt &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/13d7gaf/hemorrhoids_are_ruining_my_life/"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; her hemorrhoids “the worst pain imaginable.” The title of her post is “Hemorrhoids are ruining my life.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7ys18001s3b79h1l7j1j1@published" data-word-count="69"&gt;Some reasons for this problem are becoming clearer. Many of us are doing our damnedest to let hemorrhoids flourish: We sit too much, eat too poorly, drink too little water, work out too hard, poop too aggressively, bidet too ferociously, and, perhaps most prevalently these days, stick around too long — chronically scrolling on the toilet is as surefire a path to hemorrhoids as one could hope to find.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7ys2e001t3b7992ith5nn@published" data-word-count="92"&gt;A 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/93-of-young-people-admit-to-using-their-phones-on-the-toilet-according-to-new-survey-301302005.html"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; revealed that 73 percent of people bring their phone with them into the bathroom; among respondents ages 18 to 29, that number climbed to 93 percent. While it’s possible that these people are just lugging their phones along for safekeeping, it seems unlikely given a more recent small &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/using-your-phone-on-the-toilet-may-dramatically-increase-risk-of-hemorrhoids"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;, which found that of the survey subjects who reported having hemorrhoids, 93 percent admitted to using their phones while on the toilet at least once a week. The correlation between increasingly ubiquitous toilet-based phone usage and hemorrhoid prevalence seems clear.&lt;/p&gt;

His hemorrhoids began to protrude, and he could no longer push them back. Jeff saw a specialist who attempted a rubber-band ligation, or RBL. For decades, this has been the most common — and, in many gastroenterology practices, the only — nonsurgical treatment for hemorrhoids. It’s a five-minute procedure in which a rubber band is placed at the base of a hemorrhoid, cutting off its blood supply to shrink it. Patients are often told that the procedure isn’t that painful since the rubber band is placed at a part of the hemorrhoid &lt;a href="https://oregansystem.com/online-guides/hemorrhoid-banding/"&gt;without any pain sensors&lt;/a&gt;. In practice, however, many patients report otherwise. (“I am in agony,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/he5s2r/so_much_pain_from_rubber_band_ligation/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; a post-RBL redditor. “Nothing is helping.”) Says Jeff, “He tried to band a couple of them to see how that would go, with the idea that possibly the rest could be banded as well. But the biggest one was too sensitive — I could feel it being pulled at, and it was painful. So the doctor said it wasn’t a good idea, and surgery was recommended.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7z85x002f3b792tzylcb0@published" data-word-count="85"&gt;Hemorrhoidectomies — in which hemorrhoids are excised, or, in a stapled hemorrhoidopexy, stapled to choke their blood supply — are effective &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/procedures/hemorrhoidectomy"&gt;95 percent &lt;/a&gt;of the time. But they have long suffered from a serious PR problem: It’s common knowledge that recovery is painful and long, lasting weeks. “I’ve been doing old-fashioned hemorrhoidectomies for 25 years,” says Kim. “And there is not too much we can do to make the pain better. It does hurt, no matter what we do, because it’s a very sensitive area.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7z85y002g3b796cflgwdx@published" data-word-count="67"&gt;For Jeff, recovery from surgery was far worse than he could have anticipated. It started out okay, he says, “because they give you a nerve block so you don’t feel much after.” But all good painkillers must come to an end, and once Jeff’s did, the full picture of what his anus had undergone became clear. “It’s incredibly agonizing to shit through an open wound,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7z85y002h3b79q5b4o161@published" data-word-count="142"&gt;To help with the pain, Jeff was given oxycodone, an opiate — a common side effect of which is constipation. This is how the task of defecating became downright life-threatening for him. When he finally had a bowel movement, his bleeding became profuse. Jeff’s wife ran out to buy adult diapers so the pair could go to the ER. It turned out that Jeff had &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6331745/#:~:text=12%E2%80%9315%5D.-,Delayed%20post%2Dhemorrhoidectomy%20bleeding%20(DPHB)%20is%20a%20rare%20but,risk%20factors%20associated%20with%20DPHB."&gt;delayed post-hemorrhoidectomy bleeding&lt;/a&gt;, which affects as many as 10 percent of patients and is more common in men. After a night in the hospital and a quick patch-up of his wound, he underwent blood tests over several months to monitor the severe anemia he suffered thanks to the blood loss. During this period, he was weak, easily fatigued. The surgery was in February; it took until June for Jeff to return to his normal level of activity.&lt;/p&gt;

But fresh avenues for treatment are emerging with some promising to be game-changing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7zo5r00353b79ag8q89n1@published" data-word-count="158"&gt;A newer procedure that Kim favors is &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/transanal-hemorrhoidal-dearterialization"&gt;transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization&lt;/a&gt;, in which a device is inserted into the anus to locate the artery feeding blood to your hemorrhoids, before another device is inserted to tie that artery off with sutures. “I’ve compared traditional hemorrhoidectomy to THD, and the return-to-work rate was 20 days for hemorrhoidectomy and only three with THD,” Kim says. But because THD can leave deflated skin dangling from the anus, causing cleanliness issues and irritation, Kim has added what he calls an “anal lift.” He uses a barbed tie popularly deployed in face-lifts in Korea, his mother country, called V-Loc sutures. “The sutures have tiny hooks on them with a one-way spike so that when the hook goes in, it won’t come out,” he says. “I can use that to decrease the prolapsed skin.” However, Kim explains, the procedure is sometimes denied by insurance companies for being either too experimental or more expensive than RBL.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7zo5s00363b79qjlaiwha@published" data-word-count="146"&gt;That’s a recurring theme I encountered while researching procedures beyond RBL and traditional hemorrhoidectomy: They exist, and they are well proven, but because they are neither familiar nor cheap, they present more challenges in terms of coverage. I spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/radiology/people/david-m-mauro/"&gt;Dr. David Mauro&lt;/a&gt;, a vascular surgeon in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, who often &lt;a href="https://healthtalk.unchealthcare.org/embolization-is-a-new-treatment-option-for-hemorrhoids/"&gt;performs&lt;/a&gt; a low-recovery hemorrhoid procedure known as hemorrhoid artery embolization. The procedure involves snaking a catheter through a tiny hole in the groin or wrist down to the artery feeding the hemorrhoid, then delivering typically a combination of tiny metal coils and particles into the blood vessel to block the hemorrhoid’s supply of blood. “There’s a significant subset of patients that recur after banding,” says Mauro, “or banding fails or is intolerable. And that’s where I think hemorrhoidal embolization has a role.” However, a failed banding is often a painful hurdle to clear.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7zo5t00373b79r9bovngu@published" data-word-count="147"&gt;A new medtech company is hoping to interrupt this pattern of muscling through banding and surgery before getting effective (but somewhat more experimental) treatment. For the past few years, a company called HemWell has sought to popularize what it describes as a “painless” outpatient procedure that has been approved for use by the FDA. Essentially, a low current from an electrode inserted into the anus causes nearby blood vessels to narrow, shrinking hemorrhoids within minutes. I ask &lt;a href="https://gi.md/reed-hogan-iii/"&gt;Dr. Reed Hogan III&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist at the GI Associates &amp;amp; Endoscopy Center in Madison, Mississippi, who has performed many Hemwellectomies, to tell me more. “While the patient is asleep,” he says, “the electrode is inserted, and its current creates a chemical reaction within the hemorrhoid blood vessel that shuts down the blood flow coming in but still allows blood to flow out. This decreases the size of the hemorrhoid.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7zo5u00383b79vpuplzcm@published" data-word-count="160"&gt;I ask Hogan if the procedure is really as remarkable as it seems: Patients are comfortably sedated, and supposedly the recovery time is nonexistent, while clinical efficacy (more than &lt;a href="https://www.dhcoftx.com/dhc-procedures/hemwell/#:~:text=Why%20choose%20to%20have%20a,sigmoidoscopy%2C%20depending%20on%20individual%20circumstances."&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt;) is apparently more predictable than in RBL (&lt;a href="https://heritagesurgicalgroup.com/rubber-band-ligation-bergen-county/"&gt;between 70 to 90 percent&lt;/a&gt;). “I think this is a paradigm shift for hemorrhoid treatment,” he tells me. “I think it should be offered in every GI clinic across the country because it’s so well tolerated by patients.” Hogan sings HemWell’s praises so profusely that I ask point-blank if he is being paid to spread its gospel. He assures me that he has not received a dime. He now performs Hemwellectomies on 90 percent of his hemorrhoid patients, and his father, also a gastroenterologist in the practice, is a fellow convert. “Normally I hate to use the term &lt;em&gt;painless&lt;/em&gt;, but in two years of doing these, I’ve had about five people need an Advil or a Tylenol,” the senior Hogan tells me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7zo5u00393b79gw7faq30@published" data-word-count="52"&gt;As with other nontraditional therapies, HemWell is theoretically covered by insurance but often only if you’ve exhausted the standard options. And if you don’t happen to live near a physician who’s using the procedure — I found only about a dozen across the country — you may have to stick with RBL.&lt;/p&gt;

A pregnant person’s blood volume &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content?contenttypeid=134&amp;amp;contentid=9#:~:text=Varicose%20veins%20occur%20when%20veins,the%20pelvis%2C%20altering%20blood%20flow"&gt;increases&lt;/a&gt; by as much as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/pregnancy/art-20045977"&gt;50 percent,&lt;/a&gt; which can enlarge those veins. Hormones released during pregnancy can relax the walls of their blood vessels, making them more susceptible to swelling. Pregnancy also causes constipation. Then there’s the final boss of anorectal straining, vaginal delivery, which leaves many new moms with hemorrhoids postpartum.&lt;/p&gt;

Her luck ran out when she became pregnant with her first child. “Before pregnancy,” she says, “I’d have a lump I’d barely pay attention to, and it would resolve itself. But during pregnancy, they got worse, and they’ve never gone away. They’re just hanging out” — literally and figuratively — “and they’re probably a permanent fixture, because no &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; am I having surgery.” Though Lana’s hemorrhoids are a nuisance when it’s time to wipe (“They make the topography more complicated,” she says), they still don’t hurt. For unknown thousands, this is the status quo: a lifelong anatomical annoyance one must learn to live around.&lt;/p&gt;

Timely treatment (albeit paid for out of pocket) increases the odds of avoiding surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

Few parts of the body are more freighted with taboo and disgust than the human anus. It is, after all, where poop comes out, poop being among the ultimate embodiments of &lt;em&gt;the abject &lt;/em&gt;— all the stuff, according to critical theory, that’s so horrifying and odious it has the power to disrupt the very social order if not hidden or contained. That’s a lot of pressure on one little ring of muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

However, what may seem minor or routine could, in fact, be an early sign of something far more serious: a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Early signs of a heart attack&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Dinesh stressed that early detection and immediate intervention can dramatically improve outcomes of a heart-related ailment—yet this is often hindered by the vague or atypical ways symptoms present themselves, especially in younger populations. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/23/original/pexels-towfiqu-barbhuiya-3440682-14569658_1734957756809.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="All chest pain originates from the heart.

Gastrointestinal, muscular, or respiratory causes can also produce similar sensations. (Pexels)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Not every heart attack begins with crushing chest pain. In fact, many people, particularly women and those under 50, may experience subtler symptoms,” he stressed. He suggested some early signs to look out for:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discomfort or tightness in the chest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain that radiates to the arm, neck, jaw, or back&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unexplained fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cold sweats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling of light-headedness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some individuals may only feel a mild heaviness or pressure in the chest, which comes and goes. Because the pain is not always severe or continuous, it is frequently dismissed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Dinesh cautioned, “It is worth noting that not all chest pain originates from the heart. Gastrointestinal, muscular, or respiratory causes can also produce similar sensations. However, given the potential consequences, it is always safer to rule out a cardiac cause first.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He recommended simple diagnostic tools like an electrocardiogram (ECG), blood tests for cardiac enzymes, and non-invasive imaging, which can provide clarity within minutes. “The cost of ignoring symptoms far outweighs the time or effort involved in getting evaluated,” he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What causes a heart attack?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per Dr Dinesh, a heart attack, or myocardial infarction, occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is suddenly blocked, usually by a clot in one of the coronary arteries. This prevents oxygen from reaching the heart muscle, which can cause permanent damage or death if not treated promptly. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/07/29/550x309/2149485806_1753785122594_1753785131041.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Lifestyle risk factors—poor dietary habits, lack of exercise, high stress levels, inadequate sleep, and tobacco use—are significant contributors.

(Freepik)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Lifestyle risk factors—poor dietary habits, lack of exercise, high stress levels, inadequate sleep, and tobacco use—are significant contributors. (Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Challenges faced in detecting underlying heart issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the Indian context, the challenge is compounded by rising cases of cardiovascular disease among younger adults. Lifestyle risk factors—poor dietary habits, lack of exercise, high stress levels, inadequate sleep, and tobacco use—are significant contributors,” Dr Dinesh explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, in urban India, a growing number of individuals in their 30s and 40s are being diagnosed with premature coronary artery disease. Many of them are unaware of their underlying risk, including conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, or high cholesterol, per Dr Dinesh.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to him, another critical factor is delayed response. “Despite experiencing symptoms, people often choose to wait, hoping the discomfort will subside on its own. They may self-medicate with antacids or painkillers, misreading cardiac discomfort as acidity or muscle strain,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this delay can be fatal. “The initial hours after the onset of a heart attack—the so-called ‘golden hours’—are vital. The sooner a blocked artery is reopened, the better the chance of preserving heart muscle and avoiding complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Prevention is better than a cure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stressing that prevention is equally important, Dr Dinesh said that while some risk factors—such as genetics or age—cannot be changed, others can be actively managed. He suggests:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular health check-ups&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining optimal blood pressure and blood sugar levels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cholesterol control&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Balanced nutrition&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quitting tobacco&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular physical activity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Effective stress management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even small, consistent changes in daily routines can help reduce the likelihood of future cardiac events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Awareness also plays a vital role,” Dr Dinesh added. “Understanding that heart disease can present differently in different people is crucial. Family members, caregivers, and peers should also be able to recognise the signs and encourage timely medical intervention.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Early symptoms are not always significantly visible. A feeling of unease, a vague pressure, or an unusual fatigue should not be underestimated, particularly if there are other coexisting risk factors,” the cardiologist cautioned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the end, Dr Dinesh stresses that chest discomfort should never be regarded casually. “While not every episode indicates a heart attack, the cost of inaction can be irreversible. In a condition where time is muscle, prompt medical evaluation is the most powerful tool for survival and recovery. If there is even a slight suspicion that symptoms may be cardiac in origin, seeking medical attention without delay can make all the difference. In cardiac emergencies, time is not just precious—it is life-saving. Let that be reason enough to never ignore what the body is trying to say,” he stated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Research suggests that walking quickly for just 15 minutes a day could slash the risk of suffering heart disease by up to almost 20 per cent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over a follow-up of just under 17 years, the researchers discovered that walking fast for as little as 15 minutes per day reduced the risk of all cause mortality by nearly 20 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/"&gt;American Journal of Preventive Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, they found the effect was most pronounced for cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Professor Wei Zeng, lead investigator and expert in lifestyle factors and diseases, fast walking could reduce cardiovascular mortality by improving how efficiently the heart works and reducing obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This style of exercise has previously been shown to increase &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14931757/juice-heart-attack-risk.html"&gt;VO2-max&lt;/a&gt; — a measure of how much oxygen the body can process during exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A high VO2 max is associated with better physical fitness and lower risk of cardiovascular disease, indicating that the body is efficiently extracting and using oxygen from the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Zeng concluded: 'Brisk walking offers a convenient, accessible and low-impact activity that individuals of all ages and fitness levels can use to improve general health and cardiovascular health specifically.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts, lead by Professor Lili Liu, lead author and trainee epidemiologist, are now urging health officials to encourage fast walking within all communities — especially those with limited access to healthcare — and address barriers to daily walking such as safety concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added: 'Public health campaigns and community-based programmes can emphasise the importance and availability of fast walking to improve health outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;NHS data shows a rise in the number of younger adults suffering from heart attacks over the past decade. The biggest increase (95 per cent) was recorded in the 25-29 year-old demographic, though as numbers of patients are low even small spikes can look dramatic &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Individuals should strive to incorporate more intense physical activity into their routines, such as brisk walking or other forms of aerobic exercise.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists, however, acknowledged&lt;span&gt; that because physical activity data was only collected at the beginning of the study, changes in activity levels could not be considered. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The paper also had some limitations, they said, including the fact daily walking levels were self-reported. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sedentary lifestyles in the UK, with Brits spending their workhours deskbound, then sitting in a train or car on their way home to sit down in front of the TV, have been estimated to kill thousands each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The WHO puts the annual global death toll from physical inactivity at around two million per year, making it in the running to be among the top ten leading causes of global death and disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physical inactivity has been long linked to health problems like cardiovascular disease as well contributing to health problems like obesity, itself linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and some cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases of heart attacks, heart failure and strokes among the under-75s had tumbled since the 1960s thanks to plummeting smoking rates, advanced surgical techniques and breakthroughs such as stents and statins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now, other factors such as slow ambulance response times for category 2 calls in England — which includes suspected heart attacks and strokes — as well as long waits for tests and treatment have also been blamed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

We have been informed that the local health department is investigating several cases of Legionella in the area, and we are fully cooperating with their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Village continues to take every precaution to maintain a safe and healthy environment for all who live and work here. We understand concerns may arise during this process and will continue to provide transparent communication to our residents as more information becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Again, we emphasize that &lt;strong&gt;there is currently no confirmation that the cases originated at The V(i)llage&lt;/strong&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Allegria Village provides 55+ living, independent living, assisted living, skilled nursing and memory care, &lt;a href="https://allegriavillage.com/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to its website&lt;/a&gt;.

Legionnaire's disease is treatable with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People age 50 and older; those with certain health conditions, such as cancer, diabetes, weakened immune systems and chronic lung disease, and current or former smokers are at an increased risk of becoming sick, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Legionella bacteria occur naturally in fresh water, such as lakes and streams. It poses a health risk when it gets into building water systems and grows, according to the CDC. It indicated that people can get the disease by breathing in mist containing Legionella bacteria.

    &lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpiv2m000t26oz60mc1v9w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Uri Manor feels like much of his early life was blessed by fate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0004356nkn8il11p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Born with genetic hearing loss that enables him to hear only about 10% of what others might, Manor was diagnosed at age 2, when he&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;happened to be living in Wichita, Kansas – the home of what he describes as “one of the most advanced schools for children with hearing loss, maybe in the world.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0005356nowbwihe1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It wasn’t clear if I would ever learn language, if I would ever be able to speak clearly,” said Manor, now 45. “So I was very lucky, really weirdly lucky, that we were living in Wichita, Kansas, at the time.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0006356nok6hh8o3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Working in Wichita with experts at the Institute of Logopedics, now called &lt;a href="https://foundation.wichita.edu/heartspring-and-wsus-cassat-clinic-will-be-neighbors-in-wichitas-downtown-healthcare-corridor/" target="_blank"&gt;Heartspring&lt;/a&gt;, Manor learned to speak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhueo1g0000356nbsh1q46w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That same sort of serendipity led Manor into an unexpected career studying hearing loss himself, first at the US National Institutes of Health and, now, leading his own lab at the University of California, San Diego, where his research into ways to restore hearing was supported by a major five-year NIH grant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhugjep0002356nazomgram@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But that’s where Manor’s luck ran out. His grant was terminated in May by the Trump administration as part of its policies targeting diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives; Manor’s funding had been awarded through a program that aimed to promote workforce diversity, for which he qualified because he has hearing loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhummlp0005356ns9rxc0uo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, Manor’s research is in limbo, like that of thousands of other scientists whose work is supported in large part by the federal government and who’ve been affected by grant terminations. And the halt comes as research into hearing loss, which affects as many as 15% of American adults and 1 in 400 children at birth, had recently shown signs of rapid advancement.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0007356nsdi059v7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was intense curiosity about the world that led Manor into a career in science, where early on, fate seemed to strike again. As a researcher at the &lt;a href="https://www.training.nih.gov/research-training/grads/gpp/institutional/jhu/" target="_blank"&gt;NIH and Johns Hopkins&lt;/a&gt; working toward his Ph.D., Manor hoped to find an adviser interested in how magnetic fields could influence cells – an obsession that stemmed from a fascination with animals’ ability to navigate using magnetic fields of the Earth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0008356nj8med8jg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was describing that to a physicist PI [primary investigator] at the NIH, and he goes, ‘Yeah, I can’t support that project, but what you’re describing sounds a lot like the hair cells of the inner ear. You should go talk to this PI, who studies hair cells,’” Manor recalled.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhqnq9x00013b6n1q35497v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite spending much of his time at the &lt;a href="https://www.asha.org/public/who-are-audiologists/#:~:text=Audiologists%20are%20experts%20who%20can,that%20may%20need%20further%20evaluation." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;audiologist’s&lt;/a&gt; office, he said, “I’d never thought about the ear.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0009356nliz5veng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That PI, &lt;a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/about/staff/bechara-kachar" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Bechara Kachar&lt;/a&gt;, showed him microscope images of hair cells in the inner ear, which enable us to hear, and Manor remembers being stunned.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000a356n0subg9dg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I fell in love with the hair cell, these mysterious cells in our ear, because the system was so amazing, how it all comes together and how it all works,” Manor said. “I got goosebumps. I have hearing loss, and I never thought about studying it. But now I was in this room falling in love with this system. I was like, ‘What if this is like my destiny? What if this is what I’m supposed to be doing?’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000b356ng075x8fd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2023, Manor received his first R01 grant from the NIH, a major five-year &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/IIT2zo7phUKCNgF_giEmrA/project-details/10678569" target="_blank"&gt;award&lt;/a&gt; that would support his lab’s work on ways to restore hearing. Again, serendipity had struck; the R01 grant process is intensely competitive, &lt;a href="https://report.nih.gov/nihdatabook/category/10" target="_blank"&gt;funding&lt;/a&gt; only a fraction of the applications the biomedical research agency gets. Young researchers are advised to apply to research funding programs where they may have a unique edge, to improve their odds, Manor said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000c356n60j4n542@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There was one that seemed a perfect fit; he was encouraged by mentors to apply to a program at the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders that aimed to promote workforce diversity. It was specifically &lt;a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DC-23-001.html" target="_blank"&gt;designed&lt;/a&gt; to support early-stage researchers “from diverse backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups,” such as people with disabilities. Manor qualified because he has “congenital severe-to-profound hearing loss,” he said. “It felt right.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000d356naec9q0cv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even at the time, Manor said, he acknowledged the risk that government initiatives supporting DEI may not always be popular. His biggest concern, though, was that he might not be able to renew his grant through the same program after its five years were up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000e356nejsbh74i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But his luck turned.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In late May, he received notification from the NIH that, only two years in, his five-year grant had been canceled. The reason: The Trump administration was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/business/dei-fcc-media"&gt;targeting&lt;/a&gt; programs promoting DEI.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000f356ne3m8i7h6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Research programs based primarily on artificial and non-scientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance health, lengthen life, or reduce illness,” the notice read. “It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize such research programs.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000g356npek7s02v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No more funding would be awarded, it continued, and all future years on the grant had been removed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000h356nl570g624@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “No one ever imagined that a grant could be canceled in the middle of an award period,” Manor said. “It might be naïve and incorrect, but when you get a five-year grant from the NIH, that’s a five-year contract, and you make plans based on five years. … That’s really kind of rocked our world.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpiwzt0000356n0krjh1dk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A spokesperson for the NIH told CNN: “The study itself has value, however unfortunately it was funded under an ideologically driven DEI program under the Biden Administration. In the future, NIH will review, and fund research based on scientific merit rather than on DEI criteria.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000i356nf7fd38ir@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manor spent the next two weeks sleeping two to three hours a night, writing new grant proposals to try to replace the lost funds. But the termination meant his lab had to stop experiments, some of which had taken years to set up. Manor took that measure in an attempt to avoid having to lay off&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;staff members – which he ultimately had to do as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000k356ns95o2jv2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hearing loss &lt;a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/quick-statistics-hearing" target="_blank"&gt;affects&lt;/a&gt; more than 30 million people in the US, with prevalence rising as people age. Recently, the field has taken leaps forward, with trials of gene therapies, which deliver working copies of genes to make up for mutated ones that cause deafness, helping &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02874-X/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/positive-phase-12-clinical-trial-data-investigational-gene" target="_blank"&gt;hear&lt;/a&gt; for the first time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000l356nq6vejrp7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re at the threshold of a brave new world, so to speak,” said &lt;a href="https://oto.hms.harvard.edu/people/charles-liberman" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Charles Liberman&lt;/a&gt;, a senior scientist and former director of the Eaton-Peabody Laboratories at Mass Eye and Ear, one of the largest hearing research laboratories in the world.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“It’s pretty incredible, the progress that’s been made in the last 10 or 15 years, on understanding what goes wrong in the ear and having a pretty good handle on what kinds of approaches might work to cure sensorineural hearing loss.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000m356n2rgs1c4m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Liberman anticipates breakthroughs in the next five to 10 years in slowing age-related hearing loss as well and, “perhaps farther in the future, to actually reverse age-related hearing loss.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000n356njlijry2s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Liberman said Manor – with whom he’s collaborated in the past – is contributing to the field’s advancements.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhprgq70017356n9wd2bqck@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He has not been in the field for terribly long, but he’s already made a big impression because of the incredible sort of computational approaches he takes to analyzing data from the inner ear,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000o356n59g2vmsm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “His grant got cut because it was a diversity initiative,” Liberman continued, “but Uri’s research is top quality, and I’m sure it would have been funded just on its own merit.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000q356ncg22t349@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manor’s was one of thousands of NIH grants cut by the Trump administration, amounting to almost $3.8 billion in lost funding, &lt;a href="https://www.aamc.org/media/83996/download" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Others canceled under the banner of combating DEI ideology include those focused on HIV, where researchers reported receiving notification &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/health/nih-science-funding-states-kff-health-news/index.html"&gt;identical&lt;/a&gt; to Manor’s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000r356n1r2qc5bi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But recently, Manor’s fortunes seemed to have changed again. A federal judge &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/16/health/nih-grant-cuts-ruling"&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; in June that it was illegal for the Trump administration to cancel several hundred research grants in areas including racial health disparities and transgender health. Manor’s is among the grants included, and he received notice that the funding should come through.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000s356nx80nda4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, he said he worries about whether that decision will hold through future court challenges. And he, like so many other scientists affected by the administration’s drastic cuts to research funding, warns about the effects on scientific progress.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000t356nigo265g9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “No matter what your political leanings are, you have a 1 in 400 chance of having a child with hearing loss,” he said. Anyone dealing with medical conditions “will benefit from the amazing advances of science and our biomedical research force.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000u356nd3ud7oj1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But he also emphasized the importance of recognizing that research like his is supported by taxpayers, some of whom “are struggling to pay their own bills, who are struggling to pay their kids’ doctors bills.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000v356nvsjqg36y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And some of their taxpayer dollars are coming to my lab,” he said. “That’s a huge responsibility and privilege, and we have to make sure we’re doing good with it. For me, that’s a really powerful motivating factor, and I would like to believe that we’re doing it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

 Hoyas, often known as wax plants, have a reputation for thriving on “benign neglect”. They flower best when slightly stressed, as this triggers their reproductive mode. Regular watering and abundant nutrients will encourage leaf growth rather than blooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d3a38f79-5bf2-4ca2-b39a-fa21910e451b" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Houseplant clinic: how important is ‘plant hygiene’?","elementId":"d3a38f79-5bf2-4ca2-b39a-fa21910e451b","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/15/houseplant-clinic-how-important-is-plant-hygiene"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prescription&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Allow the soil to completely dry out between waterings – typically, every two to four weeks in autumn and winter, and more often in warmer months. Limit fertiliser applications, as hoyas flower better in nutrient-poor conditions. Ensure bright but indirect sunlight, as too much direct sunlight or a lack of darkness at night can disrupt their flowering cycle. Conversely, some people recommend “sun-stressing” their hoyas. Also, consider a slight drop in temperature overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Maintain a balance between attentive care and minimal interference. Aim for indirect lighting, cooler night-time temperatures, and less frequent feeding and watering. The mild stress should boost flowering potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Got a plant dilemma?

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts suspect the surge is due to doctors getting better at detecting the disorder and increased awareness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, health secretary &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/rfk-jr/index.html" id="mol-08e04160-6b22-11f0-bea6-f9606739b39b"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year announced a series of studies to hone in on 'environmental toxins' he believes are responsible, including pollution, ultra-processed foods and ultrasound scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lindsay Shea, one of the study authors and director of the Policy and Analytics Center at Drexel University's AJ Drexel Autism Institute, said during a conference presentation: ‘We see that autistic children have grown up to become mostly autistic adults and now older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The first generation of autistic adults are now in their 80s and 90s.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dementia is also on the rise, with experts suspecting it could strike 14million Americans by 2060.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one study presented this week at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference, researchers pulled Medicare and Medicaid claim data from 2017 to 2019 of nearly 800,000 Americans ages 30 and over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were split into four groups: autism, autism plus intellectual disability (fetal alcohol syndrome, for example) or intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were 60,087 people in the autism group, 101,748 with both autism and intellectual disability and 632,607 with only an intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were then compared to about 760,000 adults in the general population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found 30 percent of adults over 65 with autism were diagnosed with dementia compared to 19 percent in the general population, a 45 percent increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The difference was even greater for people with autism and intellectual disability, as 32 percent of this group developed dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among 50- to 64-year-olds, eight percent of people with autism had dementia compared to five percent of the general population, a 46 percent difference. And people with autism and another intellectual disability were three times more likely to have dementia than neurotypical people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also found 1.1 percent of autistic individuals between ages 30 and 49 had dementia compared to 0.8 percent in the general population, a 31 percent difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Shea said: 'This data supports the idea of both early onset and higher prevalence rates of dementia in these populations.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another study from George Washington University looked at two samples of 210 independent and 500 dependent autistic adults who reported signs of cognitive decline like trouble recalling tasks or words, impaired judgment or changes in behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caregivers also noted their dependent loved ones wandered at night, avoided initiating conversation and lost track of time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Independent participants were between 42 and 81 years old with an average age of 54. Autistic adults dependent on a caregiver were 18 to 68 years old with an average age of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 30 percent of independent autistic people had two or more signs of cognitive decline while 10 percent of dependent adults had caregivers report at least one sign of impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common cognitive decline indicators were less interest in activities, everyday thinking problems and judgment issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Gregory Wallace, study author and associate professor at George Washington University, said: 'That's very high given the average age.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Wallace believes certain medications could be to blame. Nearly two-thirds of adults in the study were taking anticholinergics, drugs that block the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is crucial for muscle contractions, memory, learning and other functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows dementia risk divided by geographic region&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They're used to treat a variety of issues including urinary incontinence, gastrointestinal distress, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and Parkinson's disease, which are all more common in autistic people than the general population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These drugs are also sold over the counter in as Benadryl, Tylenol, Advil PM and Dramamine, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought that anticholinergics blocking the neurotransmitter acetylcholine over repeated use could lead to permanent damage to cognitive functions. Autistic people also tend to be more sensitive to medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The increased dementia risk also may be tied to chronic conditions like depression, diabetes and high blood pressure, which induce harmful inflammation in the brain and damage neurons responsible for memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Shea said: 'This is particularly noteworthy because all of these diagnoses are more prevalent in autism than they are in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We know that autistic adults are often unemployed, often don't have community integration and have high rates of obesity.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 04:52:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOQk9kLXJMbGxrcVAydlJMOUZzSW5zZG9KS3BEVFpOajBmQndTSDdrMERLcUpnSS1MZWVyRUdPUUJjS0JTRHBvYS10TjdCeG5TZWdTSWQ1ejVIcmw3U0d0YVRvckNOdHE3N0VGYXRQeUszVkdMb1R2TjhwNFQxMGxkNWVFRmtRSktUWFBVY3daZXhmb1dnd3NyU05CMXEyN0dQa01B0gGoAUFVX3lxTE0xeWYzOW05d2Y2dGw4dnRZUkdyV3BRRkZLeHFhbG1oWU9ENWFvYUt5WTlpZVdLQnptS0R6dzVvSzNwYm5ndkFXMG1uVW1xc0hvdml2ZDN4eHVPZkxFWjA3LW1PVWZXdS1jVlRZNlFZYlNFNlFOcjFXcThIdnUzaVJteHVfYUFkekFHRzJHWHlSX29LZUJNb2tsZ3F5djlDYl9CTkhIRElfUw</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，五分之三的肝癌病例是可以预防的-西雅图时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxNeGlIVm9aNFB5d3NMeU9vTHQ1cGdqbk5wOE5aS3RLUEZkSzVqbWdObHpMT09na01tc2NDYzdtYVJPQ3o2MnI4eXdaZzJOUlBuRFNjYXd0UXYySjZVMzktVkhMV3FDMGdqVEl2VlJEdmxJSFhmdWdCQXN6a3ZyZ1M4bE0zY3FsOHdrWTc1Z3VRZ1o1Skx4RWROV3RfUENtU0FGM0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxNeGlIVm9aNFB5d3NMeU9vTHQ1cGdqbk5wOE5aS3RLUEZkSzVqbWdObHpMT09na01tc2NDYzdtYVJPQ3o2MnI4eXdaZzJOUlBuRFNjYXd0UXYySjZVMzktVkhMV3FDMGdqVEl2VlJEdmxJSFhmdWdCQXN6a3ZyZ1M4bE0zY3FsOHdrWTc1Z3VRZ1o1Skx4RWROV3RfUENtU0FGM0E?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;3 out of 5 liver cancer cases are preventable, study finds&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/stories/CAAqNggKIjBDQklTSGpvSmMzUnZjbmt0TXpZd1NoRUtEd2pSX2FUa0RoSGc2bDFsMms1eUFpZ0FQAQ?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US:en&amp;amp;oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;View Full Coverage on Google News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 04:27:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxNeGlIVm9aNFB5d3NMeU9vTHQ1cGdqbk5wOE5aS3RLUEZkSzVqbWdObHpMT09na01tc2NDYzdtYVJPQ3o2MnI4eXdaZzJOUlBuRFNjYXd0UXYySjZVMzktVkhMV3FDMGdqVEl2VlJEdmxJSFhmdWdCQXN6a3ZyZ1M4bE0zY3FsOHdrWTc1Z3VRZ1o1Skx4RWROV3RfUENtU0FGM0E</guid></item><item><title>研究揭示了缓解老年慢性病的关键途径- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPOVl4SGR0bkRmcXItMkVVVGtnSF9LTkFNb09YNlM1d1BpeWh0V0Qtc0h6dXROLUx2TlMydENxQWxBSGt6S2J1VFZuNDVWRnhISVAtMG1uVnhucHgyNXZRMnJDN2VFZlA3a3Rfa1ZkMHZJSldMbFV4ekdRSV9Kc0tHMTB0NDFvMXdZZ21RNWJR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Imagine two people in their 70s. Both are active, live independently and enjoy life. But over the next 15 years, one of them develops two or three chronic illnesses – heart disease,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="169321" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="169321" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; – while the other remains relatively healthy. What made the difference?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to our new research, diet may be a key part of the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00929-8"&gt;In our new study&lt;/a&gt;, our group at the Aging Research Center at the Karolinska Institutet, Sweden, followed more than 2,400 older Swedish adults for 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that people who consistently ate a healthy diet developed chronic diseases more slowly, in contrast to those whose diets were considered more inflammatory; that is, diets high in processed meats, refined grains and sugary drinks, which are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/clear-evidence-for-a-link-between-pro-inflammatory-diets-and-27-chronic-diseases-heres-how-you-can-eat-better-158451"&gt;known to promote low-grade chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-30-year-study-may-have-found-the-single-best-diet-for-healthy-aging?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;A 30-Year Study May Have Found The Single Best Diet For Healthy Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is important because having several health conditions at the same time is one of the biggest problems older people face. It increases the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/circresaha.118.312816"&gt;risk of disability, hospitalisation and early death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also places a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afaf006"&gt;huge burden on healthcare systems&lt;/a&gt;. But while it has been long known that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2014.12.009"&gt;diet can help prevent individual diseases&lt;/a&gt;, our study shows that it may also influence the overall pace of biological ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We looked at four well-known dietary patterns. Three of them – &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2015.04.011"&gt;the Mind diet&lt;/a&gt; (designed to protect brain health), &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/jn.111.157222"&gt;the Alternative Healthy Eating Index&lt;/a&gt; (based on foods linked to lower disease risk) and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/82.1.163"&gt;the Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; – were associated with slower disease accumulation. The fourth, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxw105"&gt;a diet high in inflammatory foods&lt;/a&gt;, was linked to faster accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169330" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169330" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/med_diet_example_642.jpg" alt="salad" class="wp-image-169330 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/med_diet_example_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/med_diet_example_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169330" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mediterranean diet can help slow onset of chronic disease. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADGv-APMbg/"&gt;Dana Tentis/Pexels/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strongest associations were seen for cardiovascular and psychiatric conditions. So, people who ate better were less likely to develop diseases including heart failure, stroke, depression or dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did not, however, find a clear link between diet and musculoskeletal diseases such as arthritis or osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the benefits of healthy eating were more pronounced in women and in the oldest participants: those aged 78 and above. This suggests that it is never too late to make changes. Even in very old age, diet matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does food have such a strong potential? One reason may be inflammation. As people age, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41569-018-0064-2"&gt;many develop low-grade chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; – sometimes called "inflammaging" – which is linked to a wide range of diseases. Diets high in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/dmso.s427412"&gt;vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and healthy fats&lt;/a&gt; tend to reduce inflammation. Diets rich in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/jn.115.228718"&gt;highly processed foods and sugar do the opposite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reason is that healthy diets support the body's resilience. They provide essential nutrients that help maintain &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2023.1207237"&gt;immune function&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnha.2023.100002"&gt;muscle mass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2015.04.011"&gt;cognitive health&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, this can make a big difference in how people age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study is one of the longest and most comprehensive of its kind. We used repeated dietary assessments and tracked more than 60 chronic health conditions. We also tested our findings using different analytical methods to make sure they held up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, diet is just one piece of the puzzle. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanhl.2024.100681"&gt;Physical activity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/joim.12739"&gt;social connections&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41514-024-00148-2"&gt;access to healthcare&lt;/a&gt; all play important roles in healthy ageing. But improving diet quality is a relatively simple and accessible way to help older adults live longer, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169331" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169331" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/physical_activity_chronic_disease_642.jpg" alt="man at the gym" class="wp-image-169331 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/physical_activity_chronic_disease_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/physical_activity_chronic_disease_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169331" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Diet is just part of the equation for keeping chronic illness at bay. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEvwIL0qYM/"&gt;nomadsoulphotos/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what should older adults eat? The message is clear: eat plenty of vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts and whole grains. Choose healthy fats like rapeseed oil and fish. Limit red and processed meats, sugary drinks and solid fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the building blocks of the diets we studied – and they have been associated with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03570-5"&gt;slower ageing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.27125"&gt;better brain health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00929-8"&gt;fewer chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt; in this and other research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ageing is inevitable. But people can shape how it unfolds. Our findings suggest that even small changes in diet can make a meaningful difference in how people experience later life, regardless of their age.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261233/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking study has revealed that babies as young as four months old are capable of forming memories, despite being unable to recall them later in life. Researchers used brain scans to capture memory formation in 26 infants, ranging from 4 to 24 months old. The study found that the hippocampus, a region of the brain associated with emotions and memory, is active in babies when they form memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt7570"&gt;researchers showed&lt;/a&gt; the babies a series of images and then tested their memory recall by displaying familiar and new images side by side. The study found that older infants (12-24 months) exhibited activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, a region involved in memory-related decision-making and recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We showed infants photographs of faces, objects, and scenes one at a time during fMRI. Shortly afterward, we tested their memory by showing each of these now-familiar photographs alongside a new image of the same type. If the infant looked longer at the photograph they had seen before, we labelled that image as remembered; otherwise, it was forgotten," &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/you-dont-remember-being-a-baby-but-your-brain-was-making-memories/"&gt;said the lead author &lt;/a&gt;of the study Dr Nick Turk-Browne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that infants can create memories after brief experiences, with clearer effects after 12 months. The findings support the idea that people store memories as infants that they can't access later. However, questions remain about the duration and complexity of these memories. The research also raises deeper questions about why people can't recall memories from before age 4-5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding infant memory can provide insights into language acquisition, developmental disorders, and early education. It may also shed light on memory loss in ageing and diseases like Alzheimer's. Further research is needed to uncover the mechanisms behind infant memory and its implications for human development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="v-ndtv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We know that exercise has numerous &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/less-than-30-minutes-of-exercise-does-something-wonderful-for-your-brain"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, but does it matter how much you spread it out? Even only working out on the weekends may still reduce some people's risk of early death, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers were interested in how people might build physical activity into busy schedules and decided to focus on those &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/soups-and-shakes-diet-can-put-type-2-diabetes-into-remission-study-finds"&gt;with diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, for whom exercise-related benefits such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/daily-dose-of-broccoli-sprout-extract-helps-blood-sugar-study-shows"&gt;reduced insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; are particularly important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many people struggle to engage in regular physical activity throughout the week due to time constraints," the team from the US, China, and Australia &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00640"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To overcome this, some condense their recommended moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) into 1 or 2 weekly sessions – a pattern known as the 'weekend warrior' approach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ideal-number-of-daily-steps-isnt-as-many-as-weve-been-told?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Ideal Number of Daily Steps Isn't as Many as We've Been Told&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers crunched the numbers on 51,650 adults with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="168880" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, splitting them into four groups: those who did no MVPA, those who did less than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/behealthy/physical-activity"&gt;the recommended 150 minutes&lt;/a&gt; per week, those who hit 150 minutes a week in 3 or more sessions, and those who managed 150 minutes a week in 1–2 sessions (the weekend warriors).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any level of exercise was shown to be beneficial, but primarily for those who managed the MVPA recommendations. People who participated in 3 or more weekly sessions had a 17 percent lower risk of dying during the study period, as well as a 19 percent lower risk of dying from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cardiac-arrest-and-heart-attacks-arent-the-same-heres-how-to-tell-them-apart"&gt;cardiovascular-related issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weekend warriors fared even better: this group showed a 21 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality and a 33 percent lower risk of cardiovascular-related mortality. So even if you only have time &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/less-than-30-minutes-of-exercise-does-something-wonderful-for-your-brain"&gt;for a single exercise session&lt;/a&gt; or a couple of workouts, you can still get some of the same health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168890" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168890" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ExerciseCharts.jpg" alt="Exercise charts" class="wp-image-168890 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ExerciseCharts.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ExerciseCharts-600x385.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168890" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers charted exercise against mortality. (Wu et al., &lt;em&gt;Ann. Intern. Med.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even those who engaged in MPVA for less than 150 minutes per week experienced lower all-cause mortality than those who didn't," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00640"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This underscores the importance of any physical activity for people with diabetes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study doesn't establish cause and effect and by its use of self-reported data to look at a snapshot in time – and in only covering people with diabetes. However, it's backed by many previous studies that show &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-5-minute-workout-each-day-can-still-make-a-huge-health-difference"&gt;any amount of exercise&lt;/a&gt; can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most past research has agreed that the weekend warrior approach works as well as any other: as long as you're hitting those recommended targets, you get the same benefits in terms of both &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-finds-getting-all-your-exercise-on-the-weekend-is-probably-fine"&gt;physical health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/giant-study-reveals-what-happens-if-you-dont-exercise-until-the-weekend"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's encouraging for anyone struggling to fit in gym visits during the Monday-Friday grind, but &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/leaving-all-your-exercise-til-the-weekend-could-be-just-as-good-as-regular-workouts"&gt;most studies&lt;/a&gt; (including this latest one) define weekend warriors as those who only exercise properly 1–2 times a week, regardless of the days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Previous studies in the general population suggest weekend warriors may obtain comparable mortality benefits to regularly active persons, though estimates vary by population characteristics (for example, non-leisure-time physical activity)," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00640"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00640"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you hit your 50s, Landsverk says, even moderate drinking can wreak havoc on the body. “Alcohol, besides the vascular damage and dementia risks, increases the risk of breast cancer, esophageal cancer and liver cancer (after disease),” she said. Because cancer risk drastically increases as we age, adding any amount of alcohol into the mix will only further increase that risk. “Plus, as we age, good sleep is more elusive,” Landsverk added. “Substances like caffeine, cigarettes and alcohol all hinder sleep”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In your 60s, you’ll likely begin to feel the effects of moderate drinking on your body. “I can speak from experience: This is the age when tolerance may decrease dramatically,” Landsverk said. “I am healthy. I can ski or swim a mile, but a glass of wine makes me feel ill and slow the next day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, she says, is because older people are more likely to lose the enzyme to metabolize alcohol (alcohol dehydrogenase). “At this point, I can tolerate about one glass a week,” Landsverk noted. “If I had it daily, I would feel sick with just one glass a day. Older people have less reserve in the brain, liver and kidneys. The damage to the brain from even one glass a day is worse [when you’re over 60].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landsverk suggests that you think of alcoholic beverages like candy bars. “They’re nice with some meals, but they can increase your weight and blood sugar, and over decades adds to cancer risk and chronic illnesses that can lead to poor health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to stay as healthy as possible and feel your best as you age, do you have to give up alcohol completely? No, Landsverk emphasizes, and it’s important to remember to remember that other factors influence the impact alcohol has on your health and well-being, such as if you’re living with a disease like obesity or hypertension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re older and in generally good health, you shouldn’t worry too much about the occasional alcoholic beverage. That’s certainly the case for Landsverk. “I  have decided that a glass of wine with a nice meal is worth it,” she said. “But not every night.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-moderate-alcohol-intake-impacts-your-health-as-you-age_l_65942a00e4b0f27b6e355dbb" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7914851"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anti-inflammatory proteins like fish, legumes and soy support healthy metabolism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lean meats and fermented soy boost gut health, regulate blood sugar and aid in sustainable weight loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Balanced meals, sleep, exercise and stress control are key for long-term weight health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-protein-and-its-benefits-11732679" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Protein&lt;/a&gt; plays a key role in reducing inflammation and supporting metabolic health—two factors that can make weight loss more achievable and sustainable. While no single food guarantees weight loss, some high-protein options offer added benefits that support overall well-being. "Choosing anti-inflammatory proteins helps to lower chronic inflammation that drives insulin resistance," says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaitlin-hippley/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Kaitlin Hippley, M.Ed., RDN, LD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. "When insulin resistance is high, blood sugars rise, fat storage is activated and losing weight can become more challenging."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"The real health benefit comes from choosing a variety of protein sources that support overall health by lowering inflammation, improving cholesterol and stabilizing blood sugar."

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fatty fish are top-tier when it comes to anti-inflammatory protein sources. Rich in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-lower-inflammation-8783795" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; like EPA and DHA, these fish support heart and brain health—plus, they help reduce inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Salmon is my number one favorite and highest recommended protein source when following an anti-inflammatory diet because of its high levels of omega-3 fats and micronutrients," says Lindsay Fencl, RDN. These healthy fats can also lower blood pressure, reduce triglycerides and support healthy cholesterol levels—things that are often disrupted in people with insulin resistance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beck says that the omega-3s found in fatty fish "have well-documented anti-inflammatory benefits" and are a valuable part of a balanced, healthy diet. Including fish like salmon, mackerel or sardines in a few meals a week aligns with the Mediterranean diet recommendations, which have been shown to reduce the risk of chronic disease and improve metabolic health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-legumes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Legumes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-anti-inflammatory-plant-based-protein-11772251" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Legumes&lt;/a&gt;—such as beans and lentils—are rich in fiber, plant-based protein and antioxidants that support gut health and reduce inflammation. "Thanks to fiber and polyphenols, beans and lentils earn their title of powerhouse plant proteins," says Hippley. "They naturally lower inflammation and support sustainable weight loss by improving gut health and fighting oxidative stress."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Emerging research also suggests that legumes may help the body produce more of its own appetite-regulating hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which helps regulate blood sugar levels and increases feelings of fullness and satisfaction. This is thanks to its protein and calcium content, which may have a synergistic effect that promotes increased GLP-1 production after eating.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lean meats—like chicken, turkey, venison and bison—are protein-rich and lower in saturated fat, making them an ideal option for those seeking to reduce inflammation and lose weight. "These lean animal-based proteins all offer different micronutrients that play a role in managing inflammation," says Beck. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Wild game meat, such as venison, elk and bison, tends to be leaner, richer in iron and raised without additives common in conventionally farmed meats," says Fencl. These meats offer several anti-inflammatory nutrients, including zinc and selenium, which support immune regulation and help neutralize oxidative stress.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fermented soy-based proteins, including tofu and tempeh, are rich in complete protein and isoflavones—compounds with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. "These plant proteins come packaged with fiber and phytochemicals that support gut and heart health," Beck tells &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;. These benefits are particularly valuable for reducing markers of inflammation and supporting insulin sensitivity, which can make weight regulation more manageable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fermented soy products like tempeh may also support gut health by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria and reducing digestive inflammation, especially when paired with a fiber-rich diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Recent research suggests that the health of the gut microbiome may have a significant impact on metabolism and body weight.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While eating protein can support metabolism, reduce inflammation and promote weight loss, it’s only one piece of the puzzle. "What often gets missed in typical weight loss advice is that it’s not just one food or one nutrient that determines our health status," Beck explains. "Eating habits and other behaviors matter just as much, if not more." Here are some things you can do to support healthy weight loss:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat regularly throughout the day.&lt;/strong&gt; "Eating regular meals and snacks can help regulate blood sugar and prevent an evening binge or emotional eating cycle that many people struggle with," says Beck. Eating consistently also supports stable energy levels and helps reduce cravings. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Include a variety of whole, nutrient-dense foods.&lt;/strong&gt; "Research consistently shows that dietary diversity promotes a healthy gut microbiome, supports disease prevention and enhances weight management," says Fencl.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and healthy fats as part of your routine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize sleep.&lt;/strong&gt; "Sleep deprivation has been shown to increase inflammatory molecules like cytokines and C-reactive protein," says Fencl.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Aim for 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move your body regularly.&lt;/strong&gt; Regular physical activity can improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation and improve mood. Even low-impact movement—like walking and stretching—can help regulate appetite and support sustainable weight loss. Try to engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress.&lt;/strong&gt; "Managing stress can lower inflammation, control cravings and stabilize blood sugars, making weight loss more achievable," says Hippley. Try deep breathing, meditation or yoga.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no such thing as a magic protein for weight loss, but incorporating a variety of nutrient-dense protein sources into your eating pattern can reduce inflammation and support weight loss. When paired with other healthy habits—like eating a balanced diet, regular exercise, adequate sleep and stress management—you can support long-term health and sustainable results. &lt;br&gt;

Seven million of those cases are related to cancer and its treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Col. Susan Fondy, an Army flight surgeon whose 20-year career culminated with a three-year assignment as the chief surgeon of the Army National Guard before she retired to Frederick, Maryland, said when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, she took a LE&amp;amp;RN eight-hour course designed for medical professionals “and learned a ton.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She was told the “weird tightness” in her armpit within a couple of weeks of cancer surgery was normal. When it turned into full-blown lymphedema, she realized how little the medical community knows about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="2400" data-height="3000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/IW3CRWFBKBDATPPLYCO2PILU7M.jpg?auth=8983199b8d52c376d14b4062718929fe04913e45234b2fdb7496a6510a1720ae&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=1000" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/IW3CRWFBKBDATPPLYCO2PILU7M.jpg?auth=8983199b8d52c376d14b4062718929fe04913e45234b2fdb7496a6510a1720ae&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=2000 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Retired Col. Susan Fondy, a flight surgeon who did four tours in the military, developed lymphedema after cancer. While lymphedema is not deadly, it can be miserable and she said her medical school training spent 15 minutes on the topic. She was stunned to learn how little most doctors know about the condition. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| U.S. Army Official Photo &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She said when she was in medical school, lymphedema was about a 15-minute discussion, despite how often it afflicts people. Including her. Her own cancer was found at the end of her fourth deployment — “ one of those welcome home, you have cancer kind of things.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="A-cancer-'souvenir'" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;A cancer ‘souvenir’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Tissue swells when protein-rich fluid that’s supposed to drain through the lymphatic system instead accumulates, sometimes in shocking amounts. Google the condition and there are photos of legs as big as normal torsos or ankles grown to the size of cantaloupes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Risk depends in part on the type of cancer. Seventy percent of head or neck cancer survivors will develop lymphedema that can entirely alter their appearance. Lymphedema will impact 30% of breast cancer patients, 30% of sarcoma patients, 20% of those with gynecological cancer, 16% with melanoma and 10% with genital urinary cancer. All forms of cancer treatment, including for prostate cancer, can lead to lymphedema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;There’s also a rare inherited form, different from the acquired, “secondary” lymphedema that can happen to anyone at any age, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537239/#:~:text=Epidemiology,%2C%20external%2C%20or%20combined%20lymphedema." target="_blank" rel=""&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. Swelling can occur in arms, hands, legs, feet, breast, chest, shoulder, pelvis, groin, genitals and face/mouth tissues. It can steal range of motion and discolor skin or cause pain, and alter sensation and limb heaviness. Sometimes clothes no longer fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Actress Kathy Bates survived both ovarian and breast cancer and became a spokesperson for LE&amp;amp;RN. She calls the condition a “souvenir of cancer” that is “chronic, debilitating and currently permanent swelling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lymphaticnetwork.org/news-events/video-library/cdc-kathy-bates-and-lymphedema" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://lymphaticnetwork.org/news-events/video-library/cdc-kathy-bates-and-lymphedema"&gt;In a video&lt;/a&gt;, she tells people with cancer to ask their medical team how it plans to reduce the risk of lymphedema during cancer treatment. She also tells them to learn the early signs, which include tingling and slight heaviness. Lymphedema is not deadly, though it can lead to infections that can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It is instead frustrating, disruptive, uncomfortable and incurable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Hitting-brakes-on-research" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Hitting brakes on research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Lymphedema is a stark example of what happens when medical research is deprioritized, advocates say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;William Repicci, president and CEO of LE&amp;amp;RN, sighs heavily as he discusses the roller coaster that has been research funding for lymphedema and other lymphatic diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Getting funding for research has been like clinging to a coaster’s rails with your fingers and toes and inching forward manually, then jumping into the car at the top, only to plunge to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Last month, researchers at the biannual Lymphatic Forum that LE&amp;amp;RN hosts said their grants had been canceled. Others said all research funding to their universities had been held up since March or April; whether it will be released is unknown. If money’s not released by August, research programs will start to close, Repicci said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Studying lymphedema provides insight into other diseases with lymphatic system ties, including diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Repicci said. “So when we pull back from research, it’s not just a matter of ignoring the needs of those people who have incurable lymphedema or the tens of thousands of children born with lymphatic malformations. It goes much further than that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;For lymphedema research funding, the hits just kept on coming. LE&amp;amp;RN had lobbied hard to be part of the CDC’s Chronic Disease Education and Awareness program, which gets a lot of the public health giant’s attention. Their three-year grant resulted in more than 500 people a day visiting their virtual resource center to learn how to talk to their family and doctors about the disease. In October 2024, LE&amp;amp;RN was approved for a three-year extension if funds became available. To date, no money has been forthcoming and the group struggles to find outside funding to keep the program operating. The president’s budget for the coming year has zeroed out the program entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Advocates also managed to get lymphedema research included on the list that Congress puts together for the Department of Defense peer review medical research program by showing that lymphedema disproportionately impacts people in the military, “especially by pointing out that, thanks to the burn pits in Afghanistan and Iraq, where service members were inhaling toxic fumes, they were coming down with a whole host of diseases. At the top of the list was head and neck cancer, which results in lymphedema in over 70% of patients,” Repicci said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;For two years, the research was funded, resulting in $12 million in lymphatic and lymphedema research grants. The program funding was then cut by more than half, while dozens of new diseases cut from other programs were added to the list eligible for funding. The result was twice as many diseases and half the funding, Repicci said. Neither lymphedema nor lymphatic diseases made the list for the fiscal 2025 budget, so researchers can’t even apply for the funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“This year when lymphatic diseases mysteriously dropped from the list it was really shocking,” Fondy said, adding it wouldn’t cost any extra to add it back on. “It’s just a matter of letting our researchers compete with other researchers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2174"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/FTNL754M4FH4PJLMGDSUJCC5NQ.JPG?auth=95d779daf8f67333aaac0e07df17484ac64b6db14bcadc5912ab5803f3264ad6&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=579" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/FTNL754M4FH4PJLMGDSUJCC5NQ.JPG?auth=95d779daf8f67333aaac0e07df17484ac64b6db14bcadc5912ab5803f3264ad6&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1158 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Kirsten Fox poses for photos at her home near Park City on Saturday, July 12, 2025. She is among millions of Americans with lymphedema, a condition causing painful swelling. She developed lymphedema as a side effect of surgery following breast cancer, though it can also result from other causes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Scott G Winterton, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Other research funding has also been cut or is now very shaky, Repicci said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Congress had asked the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to create the National Commission on Lymphatic Diseases to study improving the prognosis for lymphatic diseases and to learn more about them. Work began last year, but there have been no official meetings this year. Repicci thinks the panel is determined to release its report, even with no further meetings, but “I fear no matter what it says, my ability to lobby to fund any of the kinds of changes that are in there has greatly diminished,” he said, despite bipartisan support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“The sense at this point from both sides is that an example is going to be made of Health and Human Services, and there’s nothing we can do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Almost-anyone's-disease" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Almost anyone’s disease&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;While breast cancer accounts for the most cancer cases, lymphedema’s not a women’s disease. The &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/prostate-cancer/about/key-statistics.html#:~:text=About%20313%2C780%20new%20cases%20of,do%20not%20die%20from%20it." target="_blank" rel=""&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; reports roughly 1 in 8 men will at some point develop prostate cancer. After treatment, lymphedema can occur in the legs, groin or scrotum. Men and children also suffer from lymphedema either through cancer or because they are born with it or for hereditary reasons. Melanoma is one reason members of the military are hit so hard by lymphedema, because they spend so much of their time unprotected outside. Melanoma rates are much higher in the military than in the broader population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;People can get lymphedema as well from a bad car accident, surgical trauma, a groin hernia surgery, said Dr. Fatma Tuncer, a lymphedema specialist and plastic surgeon at Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah. The origin of some cases remains unknown. Long-term studies suggest it can take 10 years to manifest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Most of the time, the issue is quality of life,” she said. “People have jobs, careers, hobbies they can’t do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="1067" data-height="1600"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/CIPVEIAGTZGANF5TV5V5DVEKJQ.jpg?auth=1bd72a3d9702cbd6fe9c3f33a7f1456134921f9bc6b87198e10d62a5fa523a24&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=1199" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/CIPVEIAGTZGANF5TV5V5DVEKJQ.jpg?auth=1bd72a3d9702cbd6fe9c3f33a7f1456134921f9bc6b87198e10d62a5fa523a24&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=2398 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Ashley Hodges, holding baby, at her daughter’s wedding.

Patients with chronic lymphedema for a decade or more risk developing lymphangiosarcoma — a highly aggressive tumor that may require amputation of the involved extremity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Treating-lymphedema" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Treating lymphedema&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Managing lymphedema can take hours daily, including donning compression garments, being vigilant about skin care, doing self-lymph draining or using a pneumatic compression device, as well as special exercises to remove fluid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2971"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/QZQATABMYFHPNEPC2KJ4QU7BKE.jpg?auth=acbfa259e2c9fc4442e084d521afe5e5a96a04f668341f21084ff3a9d22fa229&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=792" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/QZQATABMYFHPNEPC2KJ4QU7BKE.jpg?auth=acbfa259e2c9fc4442e084d521afe5e5a96a04f668341f21084ff3a9d22fa229&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1584 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Jeffrey “Doc” Hodges does a light massage to help manually drain the lymphedema from Ashley Hodge’s leg. She uses a combination of compression, dressings, manual lymphatic massages and sequential pneumatic compression to try to control the accumulation of fluid. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Ashley Hodges &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Few know that better than Fondy, who wears compression garments all the time. Lymphedema, she said, is “one of those things that profoundly affects my life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Huntsman Cancer Institute is designated as a Comprehensive Cancer Center of Excellence in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Lymphatic Diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“At Huntsman Cancer Institute, we offer a spectrum of surgeries, use state of the art imagery, and offer care from our certified lymphedema therapists to provide patients the best lymphedema treatment possible,” said Tuncer, who is also an assistant professor of surgery at the Spencer Fox Eccles School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She said most people first hear the word when it’s diagnosed. While some patients have mild cases, others may be hospitalized for infection and even end up in intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The main treatment is massaging where fluid builds up, and once the fluid goes down, compression garments to keep the fluid from building up again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;When surgery was first suggested as a possible solution, it was met with doubt. Fondy said there’s no medication to treat it. Surgery can provide relief, but surgeons are often overworked and booked seven months to a year out. A lot of the lymphedema therapists don’t even recommend surgery because there are so few plastic surgeons trained to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Patients should not expect a cure from surgery, “which is not perfect,” Tuncer added. But it can help a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Some of Tuncer’s older patients have arthritis and can’t put their garments on. She would also love to see lighter garments developed. And garments don’t help everyone. Head and neck cancer treatments are especially problematic because there is no way to use compression safely. Those patients have few options to manage it, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Tuncer emphasized the need to avoid infection. That’s something Kirsten Fox, 62, knows about firsthand. In 2014, after being diagnosed with breast cancer, the Park City, Utah, woman had a double mastectomy. Because of the family history, the cancer, which was in both breasts, was detected fairly early, but during surgery cancer was found in multiple lymph nodes and 10 were removed on one side, the rest radiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She had a little lymphedema after surgery. Hers isn’t out of control like some get, but it impacted her job and thus her livelihood. Her arm was wrapped in something akin to a cast. She started seeing a lymphedema therapist for full lymph drainage. That included relatively light massages every six to eight weeks. Then she bumped her arm in July 2023. The skin didn’t break, but she developed great pain, got flushed and felt loopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In the emergency room, doctors said she had cellulitis, a serious infection that’s common with lymphedema. “I’ve never been so terrified,” she told Deseret News. “And I’ve been in a plane crash.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She had to pause lymphedema massage therapy for a month to ensure the infection was all gone; she worried about pushing it around in her arm, which was very swollen and painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;At Huntsman, a lymphovenous bypass surgery was the recommendation. A plastic surgeon takes the lymph tube and dumps it into the nearest vein, then sews it in. That helps the lymphatic fluid drain from the limb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The surgery wasn’t covered by her insurance, a decision she said was later overturned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Now she sees her lymphatic therapist weekly. And she also does self-massage and uses light therapy. She’s careful not to bonk her funny bone. And she wears long sleeves to mask the difference in the size of her arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 23:18:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOOElPdjY5aG9LaEdIRHFTSnVIS1ZmNXRwQ1JRYmtIeW42VnY0Mk1RaGZjN0tMWUwtUm8yZ0cwQ0lGNWZUYmN2WXlHSHlQUTd2Q09ISEZlbWhpNXlZcHhCNWxlbV9PeDdmMDNRQkIyd2NTVVRHakNKYkx2ckc3ZlM0XzVZUTJsdVI5R3NKMTA3UEdOVm1LbFlOeGItNkFpaHZhZFlXYVlKaw</guid></item><item><title>重磅研究中的休克自闭症和阿尔茨海默氏症的联系-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQdzVBaVJnZkpfUHZESWxFckNIOEFlLXcydkdUbzIxUk9RR1p6ekY3cE1iR2hiSE9wMS1mNzJpWmprVEFkNEZ2R29OU25KdEo1Zkd2aGxSS2dQU3labnlEZEpkNDM2VzNXdGhwT1ZqTW9HelBzZkZ0UjJvZEkxOXVIT1IwREgza3ZCZ21JV1JwVzB3blpC?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exposure to a toxic metal as far back as childhood could raise the risk of developing dementia later in life, a first-of-its-kind study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/canada/index.html" id="mol-79b5ebf0-6af6-11f0-b9c0-3167b0ebb072"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; studied more than 600,000 older US adults who were exposed as children to high levels of lead, a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14706935/popular-toothpaste-toxic-metals-linked-autism.html"&gt;toxic metal linked to autism, infertility and cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found people who grew up in the 1960s and 70s - when the use of lead in gasoline and paint was commonplace and unregulated - were 20 percent more likely to have memory issues later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These memory issues could develop into mild cognitive decline, a precursor to several forms of dementia, including &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-3d1f8ec0-6c05-11f0-8c8f-41c7c211c652" class=""&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease - the most common form which affects nearly 7 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, nearly nine in 10 Americans growing up at the time had 'dangerously high' levels of lead in their blood, suggesting damning long-term consequences for older Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research, unveiled at the world's largest dementia conference this week in Toronto, suggests the exposure is likely tied to leaded gasoline, which took nearly two decades to be phased out of cars sold in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the metal still lurks in older houses, meaning younger generations could face the same dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additional US-based studies revealed at the conference found even small levels of lead exposure could lead to more amyloid and tau plaques - which cause Alzheimer's disease - forming in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lead exposure dating to childhood could increase the risk of memory issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Maria C Carrillo, chief science officer and medical affairs lead of the Alzheimer's Association, who was not involved in the studies, said: 'Research suggests half the US population - more than 170 million people - were exposed to high lead levels in early childhood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This research sheds more light on the toxicity of lead related to brain health in older adults today.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results come as nearly 9 million adults in the US are living with some sort of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first study, from researchers at the University of Toronto, looked at approximately 600,000 US adults sourced from the American Community Survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants, all over the age of 65, were exposed to historically atmospheric levels of lead (HALL) between 1960 and 1974.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers did not analyze the source of the lead but believe that a higher density of automobile traffic, such as in urban areas, was the main contributor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team determined that 17 to 22 percent of people living in areas with moderate, high or extremely high atmospheric lead reported memory issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This translated to a 20 percent increased risk of memory problems compared to those without high lead exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Eric Brown, lead study author and associate chief of geriatric psychiatry at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, said: 'Our study may help us understand the pathways that contribute to some people developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When lead enters the body, it travels through the bloodstream and spreads to vital organs, including the brain. Once there, it infiltrates cells responsible for nutrients like calcium and iron, causing permanent damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no safe level of lead, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For decades, lead was added to paint, pipes and even some children's toys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers noted it was also used in gasoline to improve performance, and the process to phase it out did not start until 1975. It took roughly 20 years to fully remove lead from gasoline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Esme Fuller-Thomson, senior study author and professor at the University of Toronto, said: 'When I was a child in 1976, our blood carried 15 times more lead than children's blood today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'An astonishing 88 percent of us had levels higher than 10 micrograms per deciliter, which are now considered dangerously high.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers warned while atmospheric lead levels have decreased, the metal can still be found in older homes without updated paint or pipes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, roughly 38 million homes throughout the country (one in four) were built prior to lead paint bans and may still contain the paint on windowsills, doorframes, stairs, railings, porches and fences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The EPA also estimates there are still about 9 million lead pipes in use across the US. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Brown urged those who have been exposed to atmospheric lead to focus on reducing other risk factors for dementia, including high blood pressure, smoking and social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers tied high lead exposure to gasoline used in the 1960s and '70s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An additional study presented this week at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference found that older adults who live within three miles of a lead-releasing facility were more likely to have memory and thinking issues than those who lived further away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These facilities include those that manufacture glass, mixed concrete or computers and other electronics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team, from the University of California, Davis, assessed 2,379 older patients who had an average age of 74. All lived in California and were taken from two studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to two years earlier, participants who lived three miles from a lead-releasing facility scored lower on verbal episodic memory tests - recalling personal experiences - and overall cognition than those who lived further away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And every three miles farther a participant lived from one of these facilities, their memory scores improved an additional five percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kathryn Conlon, senior study author and associate professor of environmental epidemiology at UC Davis, said: 'Our results indicate that lead exposure in adulthood could contribute to worse cognitive performance within a few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Despite tremendous progress on lead abatement, studies have shown there is no safe level of exposure - and half of US children have detectable levels of lead in their blood.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Conlon also found there were 7,507 lead-releasing facilities in the US in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To reduce exposure, she said people living nearby should keep their homes clean to avoid the accumulation of lead-contaminated dust, remove their shoes when coming inside and place dust mats inside and outside to avoid tracking contaminated dust indoors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows populations served by drinking water with the highest levels of lead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A third study from Purdue University exposed human brain cells to lead in zero, 15 and 50 parts per billion, simulating the kind of lead exposure people might experience through contaminated water or air. The EPA's action level for lead in drinking water is 15 parts per billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found neurons were more electrically active than those with no exposure, suggesting early signs of cognitive dysfunction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There was also an increase in amyloid and tau proteins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Junkai Xie, lead study author and post-doctoral research associate in chemical engineering at Purdue University, said: 'Our results show that lead exposure isn't just a short-term concern; it may set the stage for cognitive problems decades later.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  The Lancet Commission on liver cancer found that most cases were preventable if &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/21/alcohol-cancer-risks-warning-labels-charities-say" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt;, fatty liver disease and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/27/scientists-warn-90-of-hepatitis-b-sufferers-remain-unaware-of-silent-killer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;levels of viral hepatitis&lt;/a&gt; B and C were reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The commission set out several recommendations for policymakers, which it estimated could reduce the incidence of liver cancer cases by 2% to 5% each year by 2050, preventing 9m to 17m new cases of liver cancer and saving 8 million to 15 million lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"society","tags":[{"id":"society/cancer","type":"Keyword","title":"Cancer"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"society/obesity","type":"Keyword","title":"Obesity"},{"id":"society/vaccines","type":"Keyword","title":"Vaccines and immunisation"},{"id":"politics/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health policy"},{"id":"society/hepatitis-b","type":"Keyword","title":"Hepatitis B"},{"id":"society/hepatitis-c","type":"Keyword","title":"Hepatitis C"},{"id":"world/world","type":"Keyword","title":"World news"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"profile/rachel-hall","type":"Contributor","title":"Rachel Hall","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2022/11/17/Rachel_Hall.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=ebf88b36e5b5ece33a2d5bb1bf844d50","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2022/11/17/Rachel_Hall_Next_Gen.png?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=19a035691b77985e87f022431bae5766"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Main section"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"UK news"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-home-news","type":"Tracking","title":"UK Home News"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"society/2025/jul/28/lifestyle-changes-and-vaccination-could-prevent-most-liver-cancer-cases","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Jian Zhou at Fudan University in China, who led the research, said: “Liver cancer is a growing health issue around the world. It is one of the most challenging cancers to treat, with five-year survival rates ranging from approximately 5% to 30%. We risk seeing close to a doubling of cases and deaths from liver cancer over the next quarter of a century without urgent action to reverse this trend.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer death. The number of deaths is predicted to grow from 760,000 in 2022 to 1.37 million in 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Previous analyses have predicted that the number of new liver cancer cases will nearly double from 870,000 in 2022 to 1.52m in 2050, mostly due to population growth and ageing populations, with the largest increases expected in Africa. At present, more than 40% of the global liver cancer cases occur in China due to its relatively high rates of hepatitis B infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One of the fastest growing causes of liver cancer globally is fatty liver disease, and this is expected to rise because of increasing rates of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One-third of the global population is estimated to have metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) – previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, where fat builds up in a person’s liver – though it can be prevented by eating a balanced diet, being physically active and potentially losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Only 20% to 30% of people with MASLD go on to develop the more severe form, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which can lead to liver cancer. The commission said the proportion of liver cancer cases associated with MASH was projected to increase from 8% in 2022 to 11% in 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The second fastest growing cause is alcohol, with associated liver cases projected to increase from 19% in 2022 to 21% in 2050. In contrast, the proportion of liver cancer cases linked to hepatitis B is expected to decrease from 39% in 2022 to 37% in 2050, while hepatitis C-related cases are projected to drop from 29% to 26%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The commission author Prof Hashem B El-Serag of Baylor College of Medicine in the US said: “Liver cancer was once thought to occur mainly in patients with viral hepatitis or alcohol-related liver disease. However, today, rising rates of obesity are an increasing risk factor for liver cancer, primarily due to the increase in cases of excess fat around the liver.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The commission’s recommendations included that governments boost HBV vaccination and implement universal screening for adults; introduce minimum alcohol unit pricing and sugar taxes along with warning labels; invest in early detection of liver damage and cancer; and improve palliative care for sufferers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The commission author Prof Valérie Paradis of Beaujon hospital in France said: “There is an urgent need to raise awareness within society about the severity of the growing health issue of rising liver cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Compared with other cancers, liver cancer is very hard to treat but has more distinct risk factors, which help define specific prevention strategies. With joint and continuous efforts, we believe many liver cancer cases can be prevented, and both the survival and quality of patients with liver cancer will be considerably improved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Matt Hoare, an associate professor in hepatology at the University of Cambridge’s Early &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Institute, said liver cancer was “unlike many other cancers” in that the death rate was still rising, with the causes varying by region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He said public health policy changes have proven effective, since Japan had successfully reduced its death rate by implementing preventive policies and improving detection to find cancers earlier. His team is seeking to identify new ways to spot patients with liver disease who will develop cancer through DNA sequencing of the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPVlFmSVh0dFNmdWRaZnFTbkl5dk11U2MwTTJHYnBlemE1S0U1ZVFqNHBTUi1tcW9nS2ZyZ3ZWVFh1NFJ5cGh5eUIxcUVJSFY2bDlqUVl1NmtiQzdzU1htRFZwN0lhZzRUQmZVZk5FeDZwWk9NZkFwYlVpNV8yUWw0cHBqR1l3V2FpdkxpZzMwTS1kQlpBX2dCVjZvandzaGQzaWRKY1U1dmFDeWRXZEF5akhQNDNTVWNCRWhv</guid></item><item><title>万步迷思：这是您真正需要的-德撒律新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxONnNHUHgyRTNsN0RRaE5BeUtWZGNTMTZCTEJEcU1XMUtTakhhWjJMNXRDR1lOQzF6cXFmTV9mZHpNTk0zZDV3bGpUaGtZZC1ZYk5faHhGRXNHbzNucl8zQjdxNE11bm41RVBTMzZHVElNTWxZbDFRSUR1NEhoUEpnS0ZrLTNkazJoVC1qY2ZLazlYcXNSdFNlTGFzZXZvX2cxLUFJUjZkbUJEVFVCQXNySg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body mt-4"&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__key-points-list col-12"&gt;&lt;div class="key-points-list-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research suggests walking 7,000 steps daily offers the same health benefits as 10,000 steps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walking a minimum of 7,000 steps can minimize the risk of early death by 47%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increasing from 2,000 to 4,000 daily steps is linked to significant health gains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Take a walk, 10,000-step goal. A new study says you might be too demanding when it comes to boosting health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Research from the University of Sydney shows that walking at least 7,000 steps a day offers about the same health benefits as the widely touted 10,000 steps we’ve heard about for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Just 7,000 steps a day can reduce the risk of premature death by up to 47%, per the study in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/home" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/home"&gt;The Lancet Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. The study focused on how much impact different daily step counts had on the risk of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The team also examined the relationship between walking a certain number of steps and the risk of developing various diseases, including cancer, type 2 diabetes, dementia and depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Aiming for 7,000 steps is a realistic goal based on our findings, which assessed health outcomes in a range of areas that hadn’t been looked at before,” said professor Melody Ding, who led the study. “However, for those who cannot yet achieve 7,000 steps a day, even small increases in step counts — such as increasing from 2,000 to 4,000 steps a day, are associated with significant health gain," she said in a written statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We know daily step count is linked to living longer, but we now also have evidence that walking at least 7,000 steps a day can significantly improve eight major health outcomes, including reducing risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia and depressive symptoms,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="The-study's-mechanics" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;The study’s mechanics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The study by researchers at the University of Sydney looked at data from nearly five dozen studies conducted between 2014 and 2025 in more than 10 countries, including the U.S., Australia, United Kingdom and Japan. It is the “largest and most comprehensive review to date,” per the researchers from the university’s School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers used pedometers, accelerometers and other fitness trackers to see how far study participants walked each day. Beginning with 2,000 steps, experts compared the health outcomes, looking at 1,000-step increments to see if the numbers made a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Per the news release, compared to 2,000 steps a day, they found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walking 7,000 steps a day reduced risk of death by 47% — almost identical to the benefit of walking 10,000 steps per day. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dementia risk dropped by 38% at 7,000 steps a day, with just a 7% extra reduction at 10,000 steps. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Risk of type 2 diabetes fell by 22% from walking 10,000 steps a day and reduced to 27% at 12,000 steps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Significant health improvements were seen when people increased their average daily steps from 2,000 to between 5,000 and 7,000 steps. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That doesn’t mean you should slow down if you’re already hitting the 10,000-step benchmark, said Dr. Katherine Owen, co-author and the study’s chief analyst. But she added that the health benefits of the extra steps are “modest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Ding said the study “helps to shift the focus from perfection to progress.

This can provide a gentle guide of what to shoot for, however, it’s best to focus on your own individual starting point and increase gradually from there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 21:06:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxONnNHUHgyRTNsN0RRaE5BeUtWZGNTMTZCTEJEcU1XMUtTakhhWjJMNXRDR1lOQzF6cXFmTV9mZHpNTk0zZDV3bGpUaGtZZC1ZYk5faHhGRXNHbzNucl8zQjdxNE11bm41RVBTMzZHVElNTWxZbDFRSUR1NEhoUEpnS0ZrLTNkazJoVC1qY2ZLazlYcXNSdFNlTGFzZXZvX2cxLUFJUjZkbUJEVFVCQXNySg</guid></item><item><title>23岁的“反vax”妇女在拒绝化疗后死亡-调查-英国广播公司</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE45dGRLU2taa3VkaGkyNlg3b3pmLVg4eFEzSXFObTRZM1lVX1dvMFJDaWRZZGJzMk1mQnh4QVkzU1VleWpLNmdERlEyTG9uaUlvNFZsWFU2Rmk5Z9IBX0FVX3lxTFB5WHFVNi00M1doQ0hIMmUyTVJQS2E1b0g2QXE0blRJVWNzRlMwVDlpaERfMm1vQUVKRjdBLTltajF2RlZJeDc2aWRWQjlWb3pfNTJyZ1VtMG1LNm1vWEFj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;'Anti-vax' woman died after refusing chemotherapy&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 jSIeFi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;Nathan Bevan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC News, South East&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/adc4/live/5831fd10-4df6-11f0-bb1d-1741330db98d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/adc4/live/5831fd10-4df6-11f0-bb1d-1741330db98d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/adc4/live/5831fd10-4df6-11f0-bb1d-1741330db98d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/adc4/live/5831fd10-4df6-11f0-bb1d-1741330db98d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/adc4/live/5831fd10-4df6-11f0-bb1d-1741330db98d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/adc4/live/5831fd10-4df6-11f0-bb1d-1741330db98d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/adc4/live/5831fd10-4df6-11f0-bb1d-1741330db98d.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/adc4/live/5831fd10-4df6-11f0-bb1d-1741330db98d.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Gabriel &amp;amp; Sebastian Shemirani Paloma, smiling at the camera as she sits on the wall outside King's College, Cambridge, with the windows of the chapel illuminated and a dark blue twilight sky behind her.

The animals, all unvaccinated and previously unexposed to the virus, appeared to recover quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Y2OPOSLBEFEHLKSSA3BW4A3EOM"&gt;But over six months, researchers found signs of chronic health issues in most of them — despite their initial symptoms being little more than sniffles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QTW5JUHLMVA5ZAC6OQN3E7VW3U"&gt;“You don’t have to have a very severe case of COVID in the first place to have potentially long-term changes,” said Dr. Charles Roberts, a lead author of the study and professor at OHSU’s Oregon National Primate Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="462DMNIYGNB5VIUDWLL4JKXMAE"&gt;Although the animals showed only mild symptoms during the acute phase of infection, up to 90% developed signs of chronic health issues months later — including inflammation, disrupted sleep and changes in metabolic hormone levels tied to conditions like diabetes and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QPITYHHY2BCX3BTRDUC2G6JHHM"&gt;The idea isn’t new to people suffering from long COVID, the umbrella term for symptoms that persist or appear long after someone has technically recovered.

The study’s findings suggest that those effects may be much more widespread than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IB6MOLLFS5FMXN5OIGFOJYTTY4"&gt;“Some adverse aspects of long COVID may not be apparent until some point in the future,” he said. “That suggests the condition could be more common than current estimates reflect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4L4PVDGJ4FAHPMHDQRDYSLZJ5E"&gt;The researchers were interested in how the virus that causes COVID-19 interacts with metabolic health. Roberts, who spent a decade studying diabetes and obesity at the National Institutes of Health, said the team wanted to explore what he called a “reciprocal relationship” between COVID-19 and chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MLALN7CGIJE53HEGHRB5HSEMTA"&gt;“If you had already had metabolic disease, like obesity, diabetes or hypertension, that meant that if you got COVID, it was going to be worse,” he explained. “On the other hand, there was a potential risk of new-onset metabolic disease after COVID.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="N5S6VCENX5FGDLWDLIT36MGEHE"&gt;To test this, the researchers used rhesus macaques at OHSU’s Oregon National Primate Research Center. The Hillsboro facility has &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/06/despite-protests-nih-renews-137-million-for-ohsu-primate-center.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/06/despite-protests-nih-renews-137-million-for-ohsu-primate-center.html"&gt;long been the target of animal rights groups&lt;/a&gt;, who have raised concerns about disease, lab conditions and the ethics of animal studies.

Their brains are wired to seek out food more aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While children with this drive can regulate their eating with whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins, ultra-processed foods, which are packed with refined sugars, industrial fats, and artificial additives, can overwhelm their brain’s natural satiety signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These foods are designed to bypass fullness cues. Sugary or salty snacks trigger a rush of dopamine in the brain far more robust than apples or grilled chicken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This dopamine rush causes the brain to seek out those same good feelings over and over again, often in the form of reaching for junk foods over whole produce and lean protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Having a strong food reward drive causes a person to crave food constantly, even when they’re not hungry, and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11696959/One-EIGHT-adults-addicted-highly-processed-food.html"&gt;struggle to stop eating&lt;/a&gt; when they’re full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists recommend &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/wellness-us/nutrition/article-13143061/avoid-ultra-processed-foods-groceries-price.html"&gt;avoiding ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; in the grocery store altogether and reserving them for special occasions. Keeping them in the house while trying to moderate a child’s eating habits rarely works, and not keeping them in the home is typically more successful, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is estimated that Americans obtain roughly 70 percent of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods and a growing body of research has linked a diet full of them increases a person's risk of chronic diseases including diabetes and cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ultra-process foods have been linked to diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and depression &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who score highest on the Reward-based Eating Drive (RED) scale, a self-reported test on lack of satiety and a struggle to stop eating, are more likely to have &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0101350"&gt;a high BMI&lt;/a&gt;, obesity, and weight fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultra-palatable foods activate the brain’s opioid and dopamine systems. The dopamine rush keeps people coming back for more, while the opioid effect dulls feelings of fullness, stimulates endorphins, and increases cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has shown that children with a strong food reward drive can regulate how much whole produce and lean protein they eat, but struggle doing the same with ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has suggested that some people are genetically predisposed to having &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2007/10/eating-to-live#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20DC%2D%2DScience%20has,to%20eat%20and%20caloric%20consumption."&gt;fewer dopamine receptors&lt;/a&gt;, requring more junk food to attain the same flood of dopamine that hooks people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genetics don't solely influence eating behavior, though. If a child is frequently rewarded with junk food or it's constantly available, they are more likely to develop dopamine-driven habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Parents have a significant influence on their children’s eating habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study found that around &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7583369/"&gt;21 percent of parents&lt;/a&gt; used food as a reward, which is associated with emotional overeating in their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kerri Boutelle, a professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the University of California, San Diego's School of Medicine, works with children struggling with their weight and overeating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her years of research have shown that children, even siblings, show different responses to ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘One child would eat half of the ice cream cone and put it down,’ she told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/28/nx-s1-5476705/ultra-processed-food-kids-health"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;. They have a low food reward drive, meaning that ultra-processed foods do not significantly alter their behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They just eat to get full, and then they move on,’ Boutelle said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ultra-processed foods, including fast foods, chips, and sugary cereals, are designed to bypass fullness cues and trigger a rush of dopamine in the brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The dopamine rush keeps people coming back for more, while the opioid effect dulls feelings of fullness, stimulates endorphins, and increases cravings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other child, who has a high food reward drive, would gobble up their ice cream cone and finish the other child’s too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They want to eat all the time, and it doesn't matter if they're full,’ Boutelle added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Those kids are going to gain weight in today's environment. I always tell parents, the environment today tricks kids into overeating.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reward-based eating is similar to but different from food addiction, which causes obsessive thoughts about food, a loss of control when eating, and continued overeating despite existing health problems, such as obesity or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 20 percent of American children, more than 14 million, are obese. Roughly 300,000 of them have type 1 or type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Boutelle recommends that parents avoid buying ultra-processed foods altogether, but if they do, limit their purchases to three items, as having a wide variety can increase the risk of overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘What you can do as a parent is make your home as safe as it can be for your children,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living within miles of the ocean breeze may be linked to a longer life, but you shouldn't count on the same benefits if you live in a riverside city, suggests a recent study.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Researchers from The Ohio State University have analyzed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/population+data/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;population data&lt;/a&gt;—including life expectancy—in more than 66,000 census tracts throughout the U.S. and compared it based on proximity to waterways. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935125012320" target="_blank"&gt;Their study&lt;/a&gt; was published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Environmental Research&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A correlation between longer life expectancy and water was clear for those who live within about 30 miles of an ocean or gulf. But for those who live in urban settings and near an inland body of water larger than 4 square miles, the opposite was true. Rural residents who live near water may also reap some lifespan advantages, according to the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Overall, the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/coastal+residents/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;coastal residents&lt;/a&gt; were expected to live a year or more longer than the 79-year average, and those who lived in more &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/urban+areas/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;urban areas&lt;/a&gt; near inland rivers and lakes were likely to die by about 78 or so. The coastal residents probably live longer due to a variety of intertwined factors," said lead researcher Jianyong "Jamie" Wu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis suggested that milder temperatures, better air quality, more opportunities for recreation, better transportation, less susceptibility to drought, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/higher+incomes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;higher incomes&lt;/a&gt; could all be contributors to a better outlook for coastal residents compared to those who live inland.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"On the other side, pollution, poverty, lack of safe opportunities to be physically active and an increased risk of flooding are likely drivers of these differences," said Yanni Cao, a postdoctoral researcher who worked on the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most critical difference the researchers found is that coastal areas experience fewer hot days and lower maximum temperatures compared to inland water areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has found a connection between living near water and better health measures, including higher physical activity levels, lower obesity rates and improved heart health. That prompted Wu to wonder if there could be a link between "blue space" living and longer lives, and how that relationship might differ depending on the type of neighborhood people call home, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We thought it was possible that any type of 'blue space' would offer some beneficial effects, and we were surprised to find such a significant and clear difference between those who live near &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/coastal+waters/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;coastal waters&lt;/a&gt; and those who live near inland waters," said Wu, an assistant professor of environmental health sciences at The Ohio State University College of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found a clear difference—in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/coastal+areas/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;coastal areas&lt;/a&gt;, people are living longer," said Wu, adding that the study is the first to comprehensively and systematically examine the relationship between various types of "blue space" and longevity in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cao said she was especially curious about how this data might provide insights into the trends in life expectancy in the U.S. compared to other wealthy nations. In the past several years, the U.S. has experienced a sharper decline and a slower rebound in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/life+expectancy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; than peer countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's likely that various social determinants of health, including complex environmental factors, that contribute to health inequities are playing a key role in the differences we saw," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Living near the ocean is linked to longer life expectancy in both urban and rural areas.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People near large inland water bodies tend to have shorter lifespans—but only in cities.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Environmental factors like heat, air quality, elevation, and income help explain the difference.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Rural communities near lakes and rivers may still benefit from their local blue spaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COLUMBUS, Ohio —&lt;/strong&gt; A new study calls into question the general assumptions about waterfront living, showing that Americans living close to the coast tend to live longer lives, while those near inland waters like lakes and rivers actually have shorter life expectancies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes, it’s long been thought that living near waterways brings benefits for everyone. But it turns out that the location of your blue space matters far more than simply living near any water at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-researchers-analyze-66-000-communities-nationwide"&gt;Researchers Analyze 66,000+ Communities Nationwide&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Ohio State University analyzed data from 66,263 census tracts across the continental United States, creating one of the most comprehensive studies of its kind. They compared &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/life-expectancy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; data from 2010–2015 with proximity to both coastal waters and inland water bodies, while accounting for dozens of other factors that influence longevity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Americans living within 31 miles &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/childhood-blue-spaces-adult-wellbeing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;of the coast&lt;/a&gt; showed consistently higher life expectancy rates compared to areas near large inland water bodies. The average American in the study lived 78.3 years, but that number varied based on their relationship with water.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-climate-air-quality-and-income-differ-near-coasts-vs-inland-waters"&gt;How Climate, Air Quality, and Income Differ Near Coasts vs Inland Waters&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The differences between coastal and inland water environments are stark. Areas near inland waters averaged 21 scorching days per year with temperatures above 95°F, while coastal areas saw just 2.2 such days. Coastal residents also breathe cleaner air, with lower levels of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/air-pollution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;air pollution&lt;/a&gt; and wildfire smoke.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Money&lt;/a&gt; plays a major role too. Mean household income near coastal waters reached $91,075 compared to just $67,774 near inland water bodies — a gap of more than $23,000 per year. Higher incomes often translate into better healthcare access, nutrition, and overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coastal geography may also provide logistical and health advantages. These areas tend to feature flatter terrain and better transportation access, while inland water regions are more mountainous and harder to navigate, affecting everything from emergency response times to daily stress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ocean acts as a natural climate moderator, helping &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/air-purifier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;purify air&lt;/a&gt; and regulate temperature. Coastal areas experience less extreme weather overall, with fewer dangerously cold days and more stable seasonal patterns. Recreational access to beaches and opportunities for outdoor activity, such as &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/swimming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt; or walking along the shore, may also offer added health benefits not always matched by inland water features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-inland-water-impacts-life-expectancy-differently-in-cities-and-rural-areas"&gt;Why Inland Water Impacts Life Expectancy Differently in Cities and Rural Areas&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s where the research gets particularly interesting: the negative effects of inland waters primarily impact urban areas, while &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/rural/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;rural communities&lt;/a&gt; near inland waters actually see modest life expectancy benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In cities, proximity to large inland water bodies correlates with shorter lifespans. But in rural areas, the relationship flips. Urban inland waters face greater pollution, flood risks, and air quality challenges, while rural inland waters can offer recreational and aesthetic benefits without the same environmental hazards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This urban-rural split reveals that context matters enormously when evaluating how water proximity affects health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-findings-mean-for-public-health"&gt;What the Findings Mean for Public Health&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These results, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935125012320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Environmental Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, carry serious consequences for the millions of Americans living near inland waters. The Great Lakes region, mountain lake communities, and riverside cities may need to address environmental factors that could be undermining residents’ health and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/longer-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team acknowledged limitations in their work, including the inability to measure actual water quality or track how individuals personally interact with nearby water bodies. They also couldn’t include behavioral factors like smoking, diet, and exercise in their analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the massive scale of the study — covering &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/where-you-live-heart-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;virtually every American community&lt;/a&gt; — provides robust evidence for the patterns they identified. The consistency of results across multiple statistical approaches strengthens confidence in their conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than assuming all waterfront living offers the same benefits, Americans might want to consider whether their &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/blue-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blue space&lt;/a&gt; comes with an ocean breeze or sits inland. The difference, the authors suggest, may be associated with meaningful differences in health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Ohio State University analyzed life expectancy data from 66,263 census tracts across the continental United States from 2010–2015. They measured proximity to coastal waters using distance thresholds of 0, 20, and 50 kilometers, while proximity to inland water bodies was determined by whether census tracts contained water bodies larger than 10 or 20 square kilometers. The team used multiple regression models including linear regression, multi-level regression, and spatial regression to examine relationships while controlling for environmental factors (climate, air quality, elevation, land cover), socioeconomic variables (income, poverty rates, demographics), and geographic characteristics. They also conducted sensitivity analyses and used mutual information modeling to identify key differentiating factors between coastal and inland water environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study found that proximity to coastal waters within 50 kilometers was positively associated with life expectancy, while proximity to inland water bodies larger than 20 square kilometers was negatively associated with life expectancy. Census tracts near coastal waters showed consistently higher life expectancy compared to those near inland waters. Key environmental differences included: coastal areas experienced fewer hot days (2.2 vs 21.0 days above 35°C), lower maximum temperatures (34.3°C vs 37.7°C), better air quality with less PM2.5 pollution (0.52 vs 0.78 μg/m³), and higher household incomes ($91,075 vs $67,774). Urban-rural analysis revealed that inland waters negatively affected life expectancy in urban areas but positively affected it in rural areas, while coastal proximity remained beneficial in both settings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study acknowledged several limitations including the use of cross-sectional ecological data that limits causal inference, the inability to measure actual water quality or recreational use patterns, and lack of data on individual behavioral factors like smoking, diet, and physical activity. The proximity-based exposure measurements may not fully capture individuals’ actual interactions with blue spaces. There were also potential temporal mismatches between exposure timing and life expectancy estimates, and the possibility of residual confounding from unmeasured healthcare access and quality factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children born by planned cesarean section are 21% more likely to develop acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a childhood cancer, than those born vaginally, a new study finds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, conducted in Sweden, is consistent with previous studies that also found a link between pediatric ALL risk and C-sections. More recent research, including this latest study, has specifically connected the majority of that risk to planned C-sections. In this study, planned C-sections were defined as those initiated prior to labor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But crucially, the risk of ALL, and childhood cancer in general, remains low across the board, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/joseph-leo-wiemels/" target="_blank" data-url="https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/joseph-leo-wiemels/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Joseph Wiemels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of population and public health sciences at the University of Southern California who was not involved in the work. In the U.S., &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/childleuk.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/childleuk.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;about 4.8 in 100,000 children&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are diagnosed with leukemia per year. So while "the relative risk [for ALL] is significantly higher" for babies born by planned cesarean, Wiemels cautioned that that the risk is "still relatively low" overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cesarean section "is a vital and often life-saving component of modern obstetric care," lead study author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ki.se/en/people/christina-evmorfia-kampitsi" target="_blank" data-url="https://ki.se/en/people/christina-evmorfia-kampitsi" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Christina Evmorfia-Kampitsi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral researcher at Karolina Institutet, told Live Science in an email. Some people give birth by planned C-section due to maternal conditions, such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000898.htm" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000898.htm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;preeclampsia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or to protect the baby's health because they aren't getting enough oxygen, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings should not be a cause for concern when the procedure is medically indicated," Evmorfia-Kampitsi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/babies-brain-activity-changes-dramatically-before-and-after-birth" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/babies-brain-activity-changes-dramatically-before-and-after-birth"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Babies' brain activity changes dramatically before and after birth, groundbreaking study finds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="confirming-a-known-link-3"&gt;Confirming a known link&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's unique about the study, published July 4 in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.70027" target="_blank" data-url="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.70027" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;International Journal of Cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is that researchers controlled for a range of characteristics in mothers and newborns and still found a higher risk of ALL in children born by planned cesarean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Crd5zr5bSuKeVw9YviMgrS" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Crd5zr5bSuKeVw9YviMgrS slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thanks to the richness of Swedish register data, we were able to adjust for a wide range of maternal, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/fertility-pregnancy-birth" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/fertility-pregnancy-birth"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pregnancy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and neonatal [newborn] factors," Evmorfia-Kampitsi said. "This helps strengthen the evidence that the association is not merely due to underlying conditions that might have led to the CS [C-section] in the first place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controlling for these other factors is important, Wiemels said, in part because maternal ages above 35 are also &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6384148/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6384148/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;associated with a higher risk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of children developing ALL. There's also a link between &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022347698701003" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022347698701003" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;birth defects and ALL risk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as environmental factors like radiation. But because ALL occurs at such young ages, researchers have been exploring factors before and just after birth that may lead to its development, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/staff/daee.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/staff/daee.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Danielle Daee&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, program director of the genomic epidemiology branch at the National Cancer Institute who wasn't involved in the work, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers looked at the mode of delivery — vaginal, planned cesarean or unplanned cesarean — in more than 2.4 million births that took place in Sweden over 20 years. Data on newborns' weights, birth defects, and whether their mothers were overweight or had obesity, diabetes or preeclampsia were also examined. Additionally, they looked at the incidence of ALL among these children over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also grouped the kids based on the decade in which they were born, to account for changes in obstetric practice, the rate of C-sections, changes in how childhood cancers are diagnosed, and other factors that might vary over time, Evmorfia-Kampitsi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 375,000 of the children, about 15%, were born by C-section, including about 213,000 planned, which were initiated prior to labor starting. About 1,200 of the 2.4 million children, or 0.05%, developed ALL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk of ALL was higher among the babies born by any type of C-section than among those born vaginally. There was a slight increase in risk tied to unplanned C-sections, which began post-labor, but the risk was highest among those born by planned cesarean, initiated before labor began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The planned C-sections could be further divided into "planned" and "acute," with the latter meaning there was some sort of immediate medical need, like fetal distress. These acute cases didn't seem tied to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; increase in cancer risk — but because there were only a handful of such cases, it's difficult to draw firm conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results should be interpreted with caution," Evmorfia-Kampitsi said. "Our primary finding remains the increased risk associated with planned pre-labor CS."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/fertility-pregnancy-birth/scientists-reveal-surprising-factor-that-may-prolong-pregnancy" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/fertility-pregnancy-birth/scientists-reveal-surprising-factor-that-may-prolong-pregnancy"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists reveal surprising factor that may prolong pregnancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="cause-for-concern-3"&gt;Cause for concern?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood ALL is most often diagnosed in children under 5 years old, and the study findings were only statistically significant for the children in this age group. In other words, the connection between planned C-sections and ALL seems clearest in that age range, Evmorfia-Kampitsi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study may "tell us something about leukemia risk, and the mechanisms behind that risk," Wiemels suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On that front, it's known that there are genetic mutations that can develop before birth and cause children to be born with pre-leukemia cells. However, more children are born with these cells than actually develop full-blown cancer, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://med.umn.edu/bio/erin-marcotte" target="_blank" data-url="https://med.umn.edu/bio/erin-marcotte" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Erin Marcotte&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor in the Division of Pediatric Epidemiology &amp;amp; Clinical Research at the University of Minnesota, who wasn't involved in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's likely that most children are able to cull those cells," Marcotte told Live Science in an email. But how?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two leading theories as to how this works, and how those mechanisms may be compromised by planned C-sections. The first suggests that babies born via C-section miss out on exposure to microbes in the vaginal canal, which may promote a more "permissive" environment for leukemia to develop, Wiemels said. Babies born via C-sections that begin before labor are exposed to fewer microbes than those whose C-section start after labor because, at that point, the water has broken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second hypothesis is that babies born by planned C-section miss out on short-term exposure to stress hormones that they would typically encounter during labor. It's thought that these hormones may help eliminate pre-leukemia cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to the idea is the fact that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/leukemia/patient/child-all-treatment-pdq" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cancer.gov/types/leukemia/patient/child-all-treatment-pdq" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;corticosteroids are a mainstay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of childhood leukemia treatments, and are similar to body-made cortisol. Additionally, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/k-schmiegelow" target="_blank" data-url="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/k-schmiegelow" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kjeld Schmiegelow&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical professor at the University of Copenhagen, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_5660407662149926785&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fleu2008212&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fcancer%2Fplanned-c-sections-linked-to-increased-risk-of-childhood-leukemia-study-finds" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/leu2008212" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fleu2008212&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fcancer%2Fplanned-c-sections-linked-to-increased-risk-of-childhood-leukemia-study-finds" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;has hypothesized&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the stress that stems from infections in early childhood can help eliminate pre-leukemic cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the root cause of the link, the absolute risk of ALL remains low even in the context of C-sections. But it's potentially something for doctors to consider, Evmorfia-Kampitsi said. "When a CS is being considered without a clear medical indication, it's important to be aware of potential long-term outcomes," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, more research on the relationship between ALL and planned cesarean is needed, as countries with higher rates of cesarean deliveries don't always have higher rates of ALL. Since the study was done in Sweden, "it is plausible, but not confirmed, that other populations, with different demographic features and environmental exposures, may have a similar result," said Daee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-Crd5zr5bSuKeVw9YviMgrS-VKE4XvquPoKgaIcjmTcOPHUWXL70w2Yk" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-Crd5zr5bSuKeVw9YviMgrS-VKE4XvquPoKgaIcjmTcOPHUWXL70w2Yk slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

She went to the doctor and was told she was in heart failure&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@elvislover1973" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Marina Jones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Marina Jones&lt;/a&gt; always knew something wasn’t right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At just 7 years old, she remembers struggling to keep up during laps at gymnastics class. Sometimes, she’d purposely show up late just to avoid the physically demanding warmups. By middle school, things had only gotten worse. In gym class, she found herself completely unable to run. When she finally tried to speak up, she was dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I remember going up to my gym teacher and saying, ‘I know this sounds weird, but I feel dizzy and out of breath every time I try to run. I feel like I’m going to pass out,’ ” Jones tells PEOPLE exclusively over Zoom. “He brought over another teacher, and they both laughed. They said, ‘Even people with heart problems can run laps — you’re being dramatic.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she raised the same concerns with family and friends, they chalked it up to being out of shape. “You just need to exercise more,” they told her. But the more she tried, the worse things got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Embarrassed and confused, Jones began to internalize the criticism. “I thought, ‘Maybe I’m just out of shape. Maybe I just hate sports,’ ” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marina Jones&lt;/p&gt; Marina Jones as a kid&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 15, new symptoms began to appear — including debilitating migraines. She visited walk-in clinics hoping for answers, but was repeatedly brushed off. Doctors blamed low iron or told her to eat more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the breathlessness and dizziness only intensified. She began avoiding physical activity altogether. If her friends made plans that involved walking — even just around the mall — she’d find an excuse not to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I isolated myself... I didn’t know what was wrong. I just knew something was,” she says. “Everyone thought I was being dramatic, so I kept it to myself. I even tried researching my symptoms, but all I ever found was asthma — and it didn’t feel like that’s what I had.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, she pushed through until her body gave out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a family visit to her sister’s college in Georgia, Jones was walking around campus with her mom, younger sister and her sister’s boyfriend when they came to a steep hill. She instantly felt that familiar fear. Walking uphill always left her lightheaded and breathless, but she didn’t want to say anything, especially in front of her sister’s boyfriend. So, she continued walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everyone was telling me to hurry up, and then... I don’t really remember what happened. I just woke up on the sidewalk. I had completely passed out,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marina Jones&lt;/p&gt; Marina Jones with her siblings&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she came to, her heart was racing, and a small crowd had gathered. She remembers her sister’s boyfriend asking if she knew her name or where she was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the scare, Jones insisted she was fine and kept walking. But her mom was shaken. She called Marina’s longtime primary care doctor and said, “She just passed out. We really need to figure out what’s going on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the appointment, Jones opened up for the first time about everything she’d been hiding: how she avoided stairs and hills, how she distanced herself from friends and even faked an injury to get out of gym class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To her surprise, the doctor took her seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He told me, ‘If you’re doing all of that just to avoid stairs, that’s more embarrassing than just walking up the stairs. There’s no way you’re making this up. Something’s really going on.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He immediately ordered a chest X-ray. When the results came back, they revealed that Jones’ heart was nearly double its normal size, enlarged from years of struggling to pump oxygen properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was her first real answer, but it was only the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marina Jones&lt;/p&gt; Marina Jones at the hospital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days later, her mom asked her to go for a drive. “I was like, ‘Why? That’s so weird,’ ” Jones recalls. As they cruised through the neighborhood, she sensed something was off. “I remember thinking, ‘What’s going on? Is something wrong with someone in our family?’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s when her mom broke the news. The doctor had called. There was a name for what was happening: pulmonary hypertension, and it was serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pulmonary-hypertension/symptoms-causes/syc-20350697" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, pulmonary hypertension is a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in the lungs and the right side of the heart. Over time, it can lead to heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had never heard of it, so I was like, ‘Okay?’ But just by her tone, I could tell something was really wrong,” Jones says. “I asked, ‘Does it affect my lifespan?’ And she was like, ‘Well…’ That’s when I knew.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite her mom’s warning not to Google it, she did. “The first thing I saw was: ‘Life expectancy: five years after diagnosis.’ And I was 16.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment was overwhelming. “I was shocked,” she says. “But I also remember feeling awkward, like things suddenly got way too serious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to break the tension, she cracked a joke. “I said, ‘Well, if I’m gonna die in five years, you guys are gonna have to do everything I want now!’ ” she says. “She did not laugh. Like, it was not funny to her, obviously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marina Jones&lt;/p&gt; Marina Jones in the hospital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at the doctor’s office, the reality of her diagnosis began to sink in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Doctors started going over all the medications I’d need, everything I’d have to do, and it was a lot, especially for a teenager,” Jones says. “But in a weird way, it also felt like a relief. Like, I wasn’t just being dramatic. I wasn’t lazy. There really was something wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the first treatments she began was a continuous medication pump called Remodulin, a flip-phone-sized device that delivered medicine 24/7 through a small needle inserted under the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones wore the pump on her arm or side, but the side effects were brutal — physically and emotionally. Even with her high pain tolerance, changing the needle was excruciating. Her arm would swell so badly it couldn’t be touched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was always uncomfortable,” she says. “I was pretty much in pain 24/7.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medication also changed her appearance. Her face became constantly red and blotchy, like a persistent rash or rosacea across her face, neck and chest. But one restriction hurt more than the rest: no swimming with the pump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was devastating,” Jones says. “I’ve always loved the beach and ocean. It sounds small, but that was my happy place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones remained on the pump throughout high school and did her best to adjust. In addition to managing her daily medications and sleeping with an oxygen machine, she worked hard to appear as normal as possible. She avoided stairs, took breaks in the nurse’s office and pushed herself to keep up with her classmates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, though, Jones was exhausted — physically and emotionally — and spent much of her time in and out of the hospital. Throughout it all, one thing lingered in the back of her mind: doctors had warned her early on that a lung transplant might eventually be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, the idea felt too far-fetched — too extreme — to truly consider. She pushed it aside, focusing instead on surviving the day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after six years of managing her condition, things started to unravel. While only 22 and attending esthetician school, even walking from her car to the classroom became a struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t want to talk about what was going on, so I’d go straight to the bathroom, check my oxygen — it’d be in the 70s — catch my breath, and then go to class,” she says. “I was exhausted all the time. I realized, ‘If I don’t do something soon, I’m not going to make it.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marina Jones&lt;/p&gt; Marina Jones after her diagnosis&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the reality didn’t hit until she went through what she thought would be a routine heart echo, a test she underwent every six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The technician kept moving the wand around, clicking buttons, not saying much. Then he said, ‘One second, I’m going to get the doctor,’ ” she recalls. “I looked at my mom and said, ‘That doesn’t sound good.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor came in, examined the scan, and delivered the news bluntly: “Do you know you’re in heart failure?” she recalls being told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was like, ‘No... thanks for that information,’” she remembers responding. “I asked, ‘What do we do now?’ And he said, ‘You’re going to have to forget about school for now. This is really serious.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At her next appointment, her longtime pulmonologist didn’t mince words either. “He just looked at me and said, ‘Well, it’s time. If you want the transplant, we need to start the process,’ ” she says. Despite her fear, Jones knew there wasn’t much choice. “I realized if I didn’t say yes, I could die,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What followed was a whirlwind of tests to qualify for the transplant list: dental exams, bloodwork, allergy screenings and psychological evaluations. The process took nearly two months, but eventually, Jones was officially approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then came the waiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They told me, ‘You’ll get a call at any time — day or night — and you just have to be ready to go,’ ” she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marina Jones&lt;/p&gt; Marina Jones during her transplant&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks later, the phone rang. She was at her apartment, which she shares with her little sister, when the transplant coordinator called. “They said, ‘We think we have a match, but we’re not 100% sure. You need to come in just in case.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones quickly packed a small overnight bag and headed to the hospital. Once checked in, the wait began, and dragged on, and on and on. “I was so thirsty,” she remembers, explaining how she was unable to eat or drink in preparation for the potential surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, after 13 hours, Jones was informed the lungs weren’t viable. The donor had complications before passing, and the lungs couldn’t be used. So she had to go home. But a week later, another message came, this time in the middle of the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My nurse texted me around midnight and said, ‘Hey, I think we’ve actually got lungs this time. I’m not going to make you come in yet, but be ready in the morning,’ ” Jones says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hours later, at 8 a.m., the phone rang, just as planned. "The nurse said it so casually: ‘Hey Marina, do you wanna come down and get some new lungs?’ ” Jones laughs. “I was like, ‘Um… sure?’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, Jones and her mom headed straight to the hospital. Unlike the first time, everything moved quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We figured we’d be waiting for hours again,” she says. “But suddenly, the surgeons walked in and started wheeling my bed out. My mom asked, ‘Wait — the surgery’s now?’ And they said, ‘Yep, we’re ready.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was barely time to process what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I texted my dad and cousin like, ‘They’re taking me back now — love you!’ And then they just wheeled me away,” Jones recalls. “It all happened so fast, it didn’t feel real… but I felt very calm and at peace.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last thing she remembers is being rolled into the cold, sterile operating room, where surgeons performed an eight-hour double lung transplant. Because her heart had been so damaged from years of oxygen deprivation, doctors placed her on ECMO, a machine that kept her blood circulating and oxygenated during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After surgery, Jones remained in the hospital for nearly two weeks, but the first few days were the hardest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had this idea in my head that the moment I woke up, I’d take this amazing first breath, that I’d feel the air fill my lungs and everything would be better,” she says. “But that’s not what happened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marina Jones&lt;/p&gt; Marina Jones during her lung transplant&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, she woke up still on a ventilator, groggy from medication and in excruciating pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My red blood cell count was too low for them to do an epidural, which they usually use to manage the pain," she adds. "So when I woke up, I felt like my chest was on fire. Like all my ribs were broken. It was unbearable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her older sister was by her side, the only one there at the time. “My mom had gone home just to shower; she’d been sleeping in the hospital chair day and night,” Jones says. “Honestly, I’m glad no one else saw me like that. It was terrifying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The room was full of nurses trying to help her breathe. Alarms beeped and voices urged her to cough to clear fluid from her lungs, but the pain made it impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t do it,” she says. “I was trying so hard to take a deep enough breath to cough, but every inhale was agony. They kept yelling — not in a mean way, they were just trying to encourage me — but it was overwhelming. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t talk. I just couldn’t do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marina Jones&lt;/p&gt; Marina Jones in her hospital bed&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the team made the decision to put her back on the ventilator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I heard someone say, ‘This isn’t going to work, we’ll have to sedate her again.’ And then everything went dark.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next time she woke up, her hands were tied to the hospital bed, a safety measure to keep her from accidentally pulling out her breathing tube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I completely freaked out,” she says. “I couldn’t move. I couldn’t speak. All I could do was move my eyes. I didn’t know where I was or what was going on. That’s something that still sticks with me. I have a hard time falling asleep sometimes because I keep thinking about waking up like that, totally trapped.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days, Jones remained on the ventilator, battling not just the physical toll of surgery, but something more disorienting: ICU delirium, a condition that causes confusion, hallucinations and memory issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My hallucinations were awful,” she says. “They felt so real, and they were all really scary. I didn’t know what was happening. I didn’t know what was real. It was a really rough couple of days.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marina Jones&lt;/p&gt; Marina Jones in the hospital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But slowly, things began to shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was taken off the ventilator, moved into a new room and placed on a feeding tube. Bit by bit, she relearned how to do everything: breathing on her own, sitting up, walking, talking and performing basic daily tasks. Eventually, when she could walk on her own, she was discharged from the hospital. But while she could take steps independently, the work was far from over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She went home with 20 to 30 different medications and a long list of vitals to track — oxygen levels, blood pressure, heart rate, breathing — all to be measured twice a day, every day. Her sister, just four years older at 26, became her rock during those first few overwhelming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not naturally the most organized person — I’m forgetful, I lose track of things,” she says with a laugh. “So my older sister kind of ‘momed’ me. She really stepped in and took control of the schedule and helped me come up with a medication system. My mom helped a lot, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first full year after surgery, Jones was basically quarantined. She could see family — but only from a distance — and wasn’t allowed in public spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was hard,” she admits. “I missed traveling, the beach, Target, Costco, just going out to eat. After about three months, I was finally able to eat outdoors at restaurants, as long as it wasn’t crowded. But for the most part, I stayed home. I was terrified of getting sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That year of isolation, however, marked the beginning of something unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With nowhere to go and plenty of time on her hands, Jones started driving around — sometimes to grab coffee, sometimes just to clear her head. During those drives, she began recording videos on her phone and posting them to TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At first, I was nervous about how I looked,” she says. “One of the side effects of the transplant meds was ‘moon face’ — my face would swell up a lot — and I was a little embarrassed. But I started making videos anyway, just talking about what it was really like being sick or going through a transplant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I never used to talk about any of this, not publicly, not even with people close to me,” Jones admits. “But once I started posting, I began getting messages from others with pulmonary hypertension, people who had transplants or were waiting for one. It was really cool, and it helped me so much, especially during such an isolating time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What began as a creative outlet quickly became something much more meaningful. As she shared more, her following grew. Since then, she's amassed nearly 650,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t want to just be the girl who had surgery,” she adds. “I’m obviously grateful for my transplant, but I didn’t want that to be the only thing people saw. I felt like I had more to say — more personality than just being someone who’s sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So she found a balance. She journaled to clarify how she wanted to show up online and mixed in videos about her daily life — grabbing coffee, running errands or simply talking to the camera with humor and honesty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It became a space where I could be real,” she says. “It helped me heal and gave everything I went through more purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, Jones says she wishes she could talk to her pre-transplant self — the version of her who was terrified of the surgery and all the rules that would follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really thought it would change everything about my life,” she says. “I imagined being bored, stuck inside, totally sheltered… like I wouldn’t have a real life anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, on the other side, she sees it differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before, my mind was full of what I couldn’t do and everything I wished I could,” she says. “If someone invited me out, I’d panic — would we have to walk far? Climb stairs? Park too far away? I was constantly worried and often had to leave early because I just couldn’t keep up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, I’m a different person,” she adds. “Those thoughts don’t even cross my mind anymore. Sometimes I have to sit and really remind myself how much has changed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there are medical realities she can’t ignore. The biggest concern after any transplant is rejection. She’ll be on medications to prevent her body from rejecting the lungs for the rest of her life, along with antifungals and antibacterials to help protect her immune system, which is now intentionally suppressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My immune system’s basically on vacation,” she jokes. “So I have to be careful, I'm more prone to infections, and even skin cancer, which means sunscreen and staying out of the sun are non-negotiable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her daily routine also includes lifestyle precautions. She follows what she calls a “pregnancy diet," so no raw foods, carefully washed fruits and vegetables, no lettuce at restaurants, no sushi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite the ongoing care, what stands out most are the moments of freedom she never thought she’d get to experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have been so many times I’ve stopped and thought, ‘This is really my life? This is insane,' " she says. “Growing up, I always thought I’d be different — that something would be wrong with me. Even before I knew what it was, I assumed I’d always be facing some kind of limitation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And yeah, there have been hard moments. I still have restrictions. I still go to the doctor. But life is so good now," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She smiles. “I just traveled alone for the first time. I never thought I’d do that. I used to bring oxygen everywhere, constantly worried about heart attacks or worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But I spent a month alone in the Cayman Islands. It was incredible. I still can’t believe it happened.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/after-heart-failure-at-16-woman-goes-viral-for-sharing-lung-transplant-story-exclusive-11778350" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 19:18:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE5xaUdRMHpnUE1FRkFoZ3pjZ2IyQ1lOSTQ3VkpDUzFQTklMQW5aZVBuSHNLTDY4eWdjM0s1LWhaOU5vUlBjcnJidzJuMmc2czZ3NzRlWU1xWWpjSnRtX01FekRMeWpTeVFsV1JJbGVfbjdlSEYydVE</guid></item><item><title>HHS宣布提供1亿美元的试点资金机会，以消除丙型肝炎- SAMHSA （ .gov ）</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxQRmZTNTdNeXJ2QXRzOTROeE1wVkRBbHRQcC01b1poemQycjRVRS1qR2lHekc0UEFWRTFpekdTbDhDZWVNLUdvTnY3Q0QwOVRLZ0NrMmxVT0FIR1FUenlKbXBsZ3g4YmlJeU1MejFLSGp3dXBSWUt2RnhVd2Jfamh6RDVJZkEzcklKMjZtMWpmZ1UtT3ZFZWEydk9CS3pXTk5nbDNFTFEyUlVpRHk2ZEhMQWxsSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The specified URL cannot be found. &lt;/p&gt;

It gives scientists a better chance to study it in depth and gives patients and families more time to plan and get support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, US researchers have uncovered four telltale medical sequences that appear to predict the onset of the progressive neurological disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the large new study, scientists analyzed health records from 24,473 people diagnosed with Alzheimer's, searching for patterns that typically led up to their diagnosis – and crucially, how different factors combined in sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that multi-step trajectories can indicate greater risk factors for Alzheimer's disease than single conditions," &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/new-study-maps-four-key-pathways-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Mingzhou Fu, a bioinformatician at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding these pathways could fundamentally change how we approach early detection and prevention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-find-2-existing-drugs-can-reverse-alzheimers-brain-damage-in-mice?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Scientists Find 2 Existing Drugs Can Reverse Alzheimer's Brain Damage in Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four "trajectory clusters" were identified by the team, which are essentially different routes to Alzheimer's, like step-by-step directions towards a destination on a map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of an independent dataset&lt;span&gt; from across the US &lt;/span&gt;found people who follow one of these trajectories tend to have a significantly &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-a-critical-thing-we-can-all-do-to-hold-alzheimers-symptoms-at-bay"&gt;higher risk of Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four clusters were mental health (psychiatric conditions), encephalopathy (brain dysfunctions that gradually get worse), mild cognitive impairment (declining mental dexterity), and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-to-cut-heart-disease-risk-heres-how-many-flights-of-stairs-to-climb-daily"&gt;vascular disease&lt;/a&gt; (heart and blood conditions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168765" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168765" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/AlzheimersGraphic.jpg" alt="Alzheimer's clusters" class="wp-image-168765 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/AlzheimersGraphic.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/AlzheimersGraphic-547x415.jpg 547w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/AlzheimersGraphic-600x455.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168765" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers identified four clusters of pathways to Alzheimer's. (Fu et al., &lt;em&gt;eBioMedicine&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used an algorithmic approach called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping"&gt;dynamic time warping&lt;/a&gt;  to standardize the duration and sequence of health issues across these thousands of database records, and find patterns that matched up between patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mental health cluster, for example, anxiety often came first, followed by &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-scans-identify-six-distinct-types-of-depression-and-anxiety"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, which often eventually led to Alzheimer's. In the vascular cluster, conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-daily-habit-could-help-lower-your-blood-pressure"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt; and joint disorders were common starting points on the road to Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the four clusters, thousands of different individual trajectories were identified, varying in terms of their progression speeds and associated &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/can-a-healthy-lifestyle-beat-alzheimers-like-documentary-claims"&gt;Alzheimer's risk level&lt;/a&gt;. It shows just how complex the road to Alzheimer's can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By unveiling distinct and interconnected routes to Alzheimer's disease, this approach offers insights that may improve risk assessment, timely diagnosis, and targeted interventions," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105831"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their findings, the team ran their model on a separate set of health records from 8,512 people. The pathways identified by the study were far more likely to be present in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-can-strike-as-young-as-30-these-are-the-signs-to-watch-for"&gt;those with Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;adding weight to the results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, understanding more about how Alzheimer's progresses in the body could &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/latest-alzheimers-drugs-can-add-years-of-independence-to-patient-lives"&gt;help us stop it&lt;/a&gt;: there may be blocks that can be put in place along the way that prevent the disease from fully developing, or at least reduce the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, there's plenty more work to do here. The researchers want to study broader groups of people with and without Alzheimer's to further validate their findings, and expand the work to more &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-isnt-the-only-form-of-dementia-an-expert-explains-the-differences"&gt;types of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these four clusters don't imply direct cause and effect or guarantee someone will develop Alzheimer's, they're likely to be important in future assessments of patients – and in figuring out how &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/latest-alzheimers-drugs-can-add-years-of-independence-to-patient-lives"&gt;to stop this devastating disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Recognizing these sequential patterns rather than focusing on diagnoses in isolation may help clinicians improve Alzheimer's disease diagnosis," &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/new-study-maps-four-key-pathways-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Timothy Chang, from UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105831"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eBioMedicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Scientists have unveiled the strongest evidence yet that a combination of diet, exercise, and brain training can improve thinking and memory in older Americans.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2837046" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of more than 2,100 sedentary people in their 60s and 70s found that those who spent two years on the intensive regimen not only improved their mental abilities, but appeared to reduce the usual declines associated with aging.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"These people are obtaining cognitive function scores that are similar to people [like them who are] one to two years younger than they are," says &lt;a href="https://school.wakehealth.edu/faculty/b/laura-d-baker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Laura Baker&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of the study's principal investigators and a professor of gerontology and geriatrics at Wake Forest University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"This is really showing that we can change people's trajectories over time," says &lt;a href="https://www.bannerhealth.com/services/research/about-banner-research/research-leadership/jessica-langbaum" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jessica Langbaum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the Banner Alzheimer's Institute in Phoenix, who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Results of what's known as the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37776210/" target="_blank"&gt;POINTER&lt;/a&gt; study were reported at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Toronto. They were published simultaneously in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The results are consistent with earlier findings from a &lt;a href="https://fbhi.se/the-finger-study/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;smaller Finnish study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which involved a less diverse population. They are also consistent with decades of research suggesting that single interventions, like exercise, could reduce brain and cognitive changes associated with aging.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A study of people at risk&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The POINTER study was limited to people from ages 60 to 79 who had normal memory and thinking but were at elevated risk for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"You had to be sedentary, not a regular exerciser, and you had to be consuming a sub-optimal diet," Baker says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Half the participants were asked to come up with their own plan to eat better and exercise more.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The other half entered an intensive, highly structured program that included aerobic exercise four times a week, adherence to a heart-healthy Mediterranean diet, online cognitive training, mandatory social activities, and monitoring levels of blood pressure and blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Both groups improved on tests of memory and cognition, but the intensive group did markedly better.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Though difficult, the intensive regimen was "life changing" for many participants, Baker says. Most were able to make substantial and lasting changes, thanks to coaching, supervision, and lots of encouragement, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There is no way to form a new habit or change behavior without intentional work on a regular basis," Baker says. "It's impossible."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Next comes the hard part&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Alzheimer's Association spent nearly $50 million conducting the POINTER study. The National Institutes of Health spent an even greater amount to have many of the participants undergo brain scans, blood tests, and sleep studies that, once published, will provide additional information.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The results are limited to changes in normal brain aging, not Alzheimer's disease. But scientists think lifestyle changes that improve cognition and reduce "brain age" are likely to delay dementia, including Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So the Alzheimer's Association is planning to invest another $40 million over four years to implement what they've learned from POINTER.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The translation from the POINTER prescription to how we then deliver that into the community is absolutely the next step," Snyder says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To do that, the group will be asking a range of questions, Snyder says:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What's somebody going to respond to? Is it going to be something from their health care provider. Is it some sort of app, a motivation using technology, is it something in their technology that they go do?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These kinds of efforts to change behavior nationwide should be bolstered by Americans' growing desire for guidance on how to improve their brain health, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"At the Alzheimer's Association it's one of the top questions we get," she says. People often say things like, 'My mother had dementia, my father had memory problems, what can I do?' And that's a motivating question for someone."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One important step will be buy-in from the nation's health care providers, Langbaum says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Doctors should be treating lifestyle interventions as they would a drug," she says. That would mean prescribing regimens like the one in POINTER, and getting insurance companies to cover those prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another boost to implementation could come from study results still in the works. These include analyses of brain scans and blood tests indicating whether a person's cognitive improvement was accompanied by measurable changes in brain health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those results are expected to be published later this year. In the meantime, Langbaum says, even people who are living a healthy lifestyle might want to up their game.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"If you already do the Sunday crossword puzzle, and it's not challenging, pick up something new, find that exercise regimen that you'll adhere to," she says, "and if you can do it around people, that's even better."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Langbaum notes that socializing is one of the best ways to keep your brain young.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

So it’s natural to wonder if there are foods to eat for migraines that might help ease symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the Experts: &lt;a href="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/brian-l-gerhardstein/2094680" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Brian Gerhardstein, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Brian Gerhardstein, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, director of headache medicine at JFK University Medical Center; &lt;a href="https://freshcommunications.com/team/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kayla Farrell, R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kayla Farrell, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, dietitian at FRESH Communications; and &lt;a href="https://www.sachardental.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sandip Sachar, D.D.S.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sandip Sachar, D.D.S.&lt;/a&gt;, a dentist based in New York City&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A migraine is a neurological condition that causes severe headaches and pain, according to the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Fmigraine-headache%2Fsymptoms-causes%2Fsyc-20360201&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fa65489066%2Fbest-foods-to-eat-for-migraines%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. And its causes are hard to pin down—there are so many factors at play, and diet is just one of them. “The concept of food triggers in the development of migraine headaches is complex,” says &lt;a href="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/brian-l-gerhardstein/2094680" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Brian Gerhardstein, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Brian Gerhardstein, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, director of headache medicine at JFK University Medical Center. And because most migraine-havers experience very different frequencies and pain points, there is no specific cure-all diet that will promise results. For example, some people find that caffeine helps their headaches, and others find the ingredient is a trigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there is “growing evidence” that certain foods may help relieve migraines or reduce their frequency, says &lt;a href="https://freshcommunications.com/team/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kayla Farrell, R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kayla Farrell, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt; at FRESH Communications. “While identifying and avoiding trigger foods is important, incorporating nutrient-rich, anti-inflammatory foods into the diet can also support migraine management,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Foods and drinks for migraines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some foods experts say may help you find relief or lessen the frequency of migraines. Again, more research is needed on the connection between what you eat and migraines, but these bites and sips may be promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fatty fish&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fish like salmon, tuna, mackerel, herring, sardines, and oysters are high in omega-3 fatty acids, “which are known for their anti-inflammatory properties,” says Farrell, and therefore &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952327818300723" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:may offer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;may offer&lt;/a&gt; migraine relief. In &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n1448" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, after 16 weeks of treatment with diets higher in omega-3 fatty acids, the frequency and severity of headaches in people with regular migraines were reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Flax seeds, edamame, walnuts, and avocado&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who aren’t meat eaters, these foods are also high in omega-3 fatty acids and may offer the above benefits while remaining plant-based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sweet potato, eggs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, migraines are triggered by temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD), explains &lt;a href="https://www.sachardental.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sandip Sachar, D.D.S.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sandip Sachar, D.D.S.&lt;/a&gt;, a dentist based in New York City, which manifests as tight muscles around the jaw, head, and neck, often due to teeth clenching or grinding. Symptoms can be exacerbated by a diet of hard, chewy foods. So, Sachar recommends prioritizing soft, nutritious eats like mashed sweet potatoes and scrambled eggs that are easy to chew and won’t trigger pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Beans, berries, and apples&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9846638/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 12,710 people, researchers found that an increase of 10 grams of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/a33382312/fiber-for-weight-loss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; per day in their diets decreased severe headache or migraine prevalence by 11%. Most fruits and vegetables contain some amount of fiber, but legumes, berries, and apples, are on the top of that list. The study authors explained that the gut-brain axis’s impact on migraines has not been explored much, but research suggests that more “intestinal permeability may lead to the arrival of pro-inflammatory substances,” in an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7164539/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:area of the brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;area of the brain&lt;/a&gt; that plays a role in pain receptors and headaches. Therefore, boosting fiber may help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Brown rice, bananas, and dark leafy greens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33503279/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; published in 2021 found that people who experienced migraines weren’t getting enough magnesium, “a mineral that plays a role in muscle and nerve function,” explains Farrell. The study authors noted that magnesium’s association with serotonin (a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22572-serotonin" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chemical;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;chemical&lt;/a&gt; that carries messages between nerve cells in the brain and body) may aid in migraine treatment. Other &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7489225/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; found the nutrient to offer some relief in women with migraines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many foods on this list &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a60749717/foods-high-in-magnesium/#foods-high-in-magnesium" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:contain magnesium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;contain magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, and some other honorable mentions are brown rice, bananas, and dark leafy greens. In fact, one &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8689122/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; discovered improvement of migraines when participants followed a whole food, plant-based diet with emphasis on dark, leafy greens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Water, cucumber, and watermelon&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is important to maintain adequate hydration throughout the course of the day as well,” says Dr. Gerhardstein. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32446809/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2020 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; on 256 adult women who were 45 and younger found that drinking more water each day decreased both the severity and frequency of their migraines. “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8280611/#Sec8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dehydration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dehydration&lt;/a&gt; related to migraines can be overlooked as a trigger and can make headaches worse,” adds Farrell. If you struggle to drink enough water, you can eat hydrating fruits and vegetables like cucumber and watermelon to help support fluid balance and retention, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Foods to avoid if you get migraines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Avoiding or limiting certain foods may be important for a subset of people with migraines, but there is inconsistent scientific evidence that certain foods are migraine triggers,” says Dr. Gerhardstein. With that said, “the most commonly cited triggering foods include alcohol and chocolate,” he adds. “Other possible triggers include cheese, yogurt, meats containing sulfites (like salami, ham, sausage, and bacon), soy products, certain vegetables (like tomatoes and onions), as well as foods containing aspartame sweetener, MSG, or caffeine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, it’s important to note that there is a lack of consistency among research on all of these potential triggers. “So, this means that there is no particular food that should be avoided for all migraine sufferers,” says Dr. Gerhardstein. “In fact, avoiding certain foods for fear of migraine attacks may actually cause more health concerns, stress, or social anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Caffeine and migraines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Gerhardstein mentioned, caffeine is often cited as a migraine trigger ingredient by his patients. However, it’s worth mentioning that the stimulant is an active ingredient in multiple over-the-counter headache medications, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Excedrin-Strength-Caplets-Headache-Relief/dp/B012SA8IOO?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.65489066%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Excedrin;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Excedrin&lt;/a&gt;. Also, some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7468766/#sec4-nutrients-12-02259" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found caffeine to effectively relieve acute headache pain, but notes that further investigation into the link between the two is warranted to fully understand caffeine’s potential impact. Therefore, consult your physician if you believe caffeine may help or hinder your migraine symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Migraine diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A generally accepted migraine diet would simply be a healthy, balanced diet that prioritizes whole, fresh foods, says Dr. Gerhardstein. “More studies are needed to discern if there is indeed a scientific basis for specific food triggers in migraines,” he concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 18:29:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE9lSEFDbmdBRDZnV3c1alRSNlNHLS0wSUV2dkVVYVl5V2JkSV9COUMzQXdIWFlyNThtTnVjcVR4Wi1IRmFUa1JFR0M1ZmlsdG5SNW9wNmU5dEhCRUJzNEwtNzhHR0lGcU9FYjZ1QmdYa0s</guid></item><item><title>肌酸可能是看到严重肌肉增长的秘诀—但不要犯这个错误-纽约邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxOejhVaGFpZFJteE0zdHBoQjM4SWdjTGp0c1Z1M2YtdHJvZ2R4TVk3UlNDSVE1bFFRZTQ4aXVsWHdoUGNoYzhoV1EzV0RUaUVpZzNKQVhfMlVVZm92enFjb0pOWDBfY1RULWNZQzRJNzM3MEJXVnZYZzlzUjV5TThuYkg3WlpBclFlNG92Z05XRlVJbkhaWE9ibnlJNldIeDA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TikTokers describe it as “natural fuel,” and biochemists tout its far-reaching benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ZFOXOZJL/c/protein-fitness/performance-supplements/creatine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;creatine&lt;/a&gt; craze is real. The organic compound, which is naturally found in the body’s muscles, as well as seafood, meat, and poultry, has been trusted by professional athletes for decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, it’s surging in popularity online and has become one of the most studied supplements in sports nutrition. But, choosing the right form — and brand — is very important, as some people could be more sensitive to side effects. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ZFOXOZJL/c/protein-fitness/performance-supplements/creatine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;The Vitamin Shoppe&lt;/a&gt;, creatine sales have exploded by over 320% in the past five years. The company’s nutritionist, Brian Tanzer, explained that creatine works by helping muscles produce more energy during short, intense activities like sprinting, lifting weights, or doing burpees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10449017" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise found that men who added creatine to their diets made greater strength and muscle mass gains after 12 weeks of strength-training than those who took a placebo. Emerging research has also revealed that creatine could support &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8912287/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;brain function&lt;/a&gt;, healthy aging, and even blood sugar level regulation. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, before starting creatine, there are some things users should be aware of. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Creatine can draw water into the intestines, which may lead to gut discomfort for some users. On social media, some &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@realityofnaj/video/7517096138793618719" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;viral posts&lt;/a&gt; reveal alarming before-and-after videos highlighting bloating as a side effect. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tanzer shared that there is another option for those with sensitive stomachs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you have digestive issues with monohydrate, you’d want to try creatine hydrochloride, which is more soluble,” he recommended, also adding that drinking plenty of water also helps the body metabolize the creatine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re goal is to complete a marathon or triathlon, creatine may not be the best supplement for you. Tanzer explained that it’s a great compound for bursts of power, but does less for long-term endurance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Vitamin Shoppe offers a selection of &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ZFOXOZJL/c/protein-fitness/performance-supplements/creatine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;creatine products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ZFOXOZJL/p/creatine-monohydrate-unflavored-60-powder/vs-0397" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;powders&lt;/a&gt;, soft-chew &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ZFOXOZJL/p/creatine-gummies-strawberry-90-chews/vs-0442" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;bites&lt;/a&gt;, and time-release &lt;a href="https://www.vitaminshoppe.com/p/creatine-beadlet-n-a-120-capsules/vs-0401" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;beadlets&lt;/a&gt; that support a variety of health needs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As always, be sure to check with a physician before adding new supplements to your health regimen. &lt;/p&gt;

class="wp-element-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;The Vitamin Shoppe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sensitive stomach? No worries. BodyTech is Vitamin Shoppe’s #1 selling creatine brand, and the 100% Pure Creatine Monohydrate is micronized for enhanced absorption and reduced GI discomfort. It’s also completely free of the junk — artificial sweeteners, dyes, fillers, and additives. Mix it into a glass of water, and get your daily dose of 5 grams of creatine in every scoop. Reviewers say they barely notice the taste, but have noticed some big changes during sweat sessions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directions: &lt;/strong&gt;Mix one (1) scoop with 8-12 oz. of water and consume immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who struggle to swallow pills or prefer not to make a mess while mixing powders, Body Tech’s Creatine Soft Chews are an excellent option. These bites are still packed with 5 grams of creatine monohydrate, and are bursting with a juicy strawberry flavor to satisfy your sweet tooth. Reviewers say they’re super convenient for traveling, there’s no need t,o take them with water, and the taste is on point. With 90 chews per bag, you should be stocked up for long enough.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directions:&lt;/strong&gt; Take three (3) soft chews daily.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;The flagship health journal published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has grown quiet this year, and a report from &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/exclusives/116670"&gt;MedPage Today&lt;/a&gt; indicates that a variety of actions by the Trump administration may be to blame for hamstringing the critical resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most strikingly, sources told MedPage that the journal's scientific articles must now obtain clearance for publication from health secretary and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—who has no health, science, or medical background. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services disputed this claim, calling it "false."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, there's no denying that the journal appears to have been muffled in some ways since the new administration took office. Publications have slowed and press are no longer getting early access to studies under the standard embargo system. And, for the first time in its more than 60-year history, the journal—&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/index.html"&gt;the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)&lt;/a&gt;—was not published on schedule amid a blanket federal communication freeze in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MedPage crunched the numbers, looking at published study totals for May, June, and July in past years compared to this one. The outlet included five previous years: 2022 to 2024 as well as 2018 to 2019, leaving out the peak years of the COVID-19 pandemic when public health communications could have spiked. In 2025, there were only 35 total publications in the three-month window, but in the past years, the average was 76, with a range of 55 to 89.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Is it OK to mix and match meals if there's one I don't like?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/19753/cuisines-regions/mediterranean/quick-easy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Quick &amp;amp; Easy Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 313 to 390 calories, while the lunches span 377 to 390 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Is there a way to reverse insulin resistance?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. There are ways to help make your cells more responsive to insulin, such as weight loss, exercise and by eating a balanced diet that is higher in fiber and protein and less added sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_157-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People who follow the Mediterranean diet are less likely to develop insulin resistance and its associated conditions, like type 2 diabetes and heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Because the Mediterranean diet is so broad, there is not one single nutrient or food that we can point to as the reason for its associated health benefits. Rather, it's likely that the diet's high &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; content—from its inclusion of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes—plays a role. Plus, the diet incorporates foods linked to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292071/the-best-foods-to-eat-to-fight-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reducing inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, like nutrient-rich fruits and vegetables, fish, unsaturated-fat-rich plant oils, herbs, spices, nuts and seeds. Though it doesn't completely restrict anything, the Mediterranean diet doesn't include a lot of added sugars or processed and refined grains, which are linked to increased blood sugar levels. And, the diet focuses on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8025502/cooking-and-eating-together-impact-your-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;healthy habits around food&lt;/a&gt;, such as cooking more meals at home, sharing meals with others and finding overall enjoyment in our food again.

&lt;p&gt;We've all used plastic utensils at picnics, with takeout, or at the office kitchen. Some of us even gather and keep excess plastic spoons, forks, and knives so we can use them some other time. There's no denying they're pretty convenient since not everyone likes carrying dirty metal utensils around. However, considering the Earth's growing problem with plastics (especially microplastics), it's time we consider ditching disposable plastic utensils once and for all and switch to a more eco-friendly alternative — like disposable bamboo utensils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to their petroleum-based plastic counterparts, bamboo utensils are 100% biodegradable. Aside from being environmentally friendly, they're safer for the body, too. Bamboo is an exceptionally sustainable material since the plant grows rapidly and doesn't need fertilizer to thrive. It also easily regenerates after harvest without the need for replanting. When shaped into utensils, bamboo remains durable, stable, and heat-resistant, so it's safe to use in both hot and cold meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching to disposable bamboo utensils makes it easy to &lt;a href="https://www.thetakeout.com/1795440/how-to-avoid-microplastics-food-drink/" target="_blank"&gt;avoid eating or drinking microplastics&lt;/a&gt;. Plastic spoons and forks can warp, melt, or leach chemicals that are harmful to the body. Worse, they shed small plastic particles which are invisible to the naked eye. When ingested, microplastics enter the bloodstream and raise concerns for a slew of health issues. Meanwhile, since bamboo utensils don't have synthetic polymers, the risk of ingesting plastic fragments is nil.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some time now, we've become increasingly aware of how dangerous plastic can be to our environment and health. We're told to &lt;a href="https://www.thetakeout.com/1797867/why-avoid-plastic-food-containers/" target="_blank"&gt;avoid eating from plastic go-to containers&lt;/a&gt;, swap out plastic bottles for metal ones, and basically avoid plastic at all costs. Even purportedly safe composites have their drawbacks, with &lt;a href="https://www.thetakeout.com/microwave-safe-plastic-container-danger-microplastics-1850884345/" target="_blank"&gt;"microwave safe" plastic now being considered misleading&lt;/a&gt;. That is to say, in recent years the scientific community has been putting more emphasis on microplastics, and for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since the term "microplastics" was coined in the early 2000s to describe tiny fragments of plastic debris, research has been underway to find out what it does to the human body. In 2022, researchers detected microplastics in the bloodstream of 80% of people they tested. Three years later, another study discovered an alarming accumulation of microplastics in human brains and other organs. As more evidence continues to unfold, scientists infer that microplastics cause health issues like inflammation and abnormal organ development, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways for microplastics to enter the body, but one that's surprisingly overlooked is the use of plastic utensils. Hot water exposure can cause these disposable plastics to release millions of microplastic particles, which has us wondering what's happening when we use them to pick up hot food. It's not just temperature, either. Salt, acid, and oil (all of which are plentiful in food) can also do the same. Imagine how many microplastics would end up in your body if you used plastic utensils for every meal.&lt;/p&gt;

Using objective sleep data from actigraphy devices worn by over 88,000 people for nearly seven years, the study found that erratic bedtimes and poor circadian stability were among the most damaging traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with irregular sleep schedules had significantly higher risks for serious conditions, including liver cirrhosis and gangrene. The findings challenge previous assumptions about long sleep being harmful and spotlight sleep regularity—not just duration—as a critical factor in long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Widespread Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Poor sleep regularity was linked to 172 diseases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Irregular bedtime raised liver cirrhosis risk 2.57x; low rhythm stability raised gangrene risk 2.61x.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth Debunked:&lt;/strong&gt; Most “long sleepers” actually had poor sleep efficiency—not longer sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Health Data Science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A groundbreaking international study, recently published in &lt;em&gt;Health Data Science&lt;/em&gt;, analyzed objective sleep data from 88,461 adults in the UK Biobank and found significant associations between sleep traits and 172 diseases. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, led by teams from Peking University and Army Medical University, highlights sleep regularity—such as bedtime consistency and circadian rhythm stability—as an underrecognized but critical factor in disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111979"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sleep-health-disease-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sleep-health-disease-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sleep-health-disease-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sleep-health-disease-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sleep-health-disease-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sleep-health-disease-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sleep-health-disease-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sleep-health-disease-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two people sleeping.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using actigraphy data over an average of 6.8 years, researchers identified that 92 diseases had over 20% of their risk attributable to poor sleep behavior. Notably, irregular bedtime (after 00:30) was linked to a 2.57-fold higher risk of liver cirrhosis, while low interdaily stability increased the risk of gangrene by 2.61 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the study challenges previous claims that “long sleep” (≥9 hours) is harmful. While subjective reports have linked long sleep to stroke and heart disease, objective data revealed this association in only one disease. Misclassification may be to blame: 21.67% of “long sleepers” actually slept less than 6 hours, suggesting that time spent in bed is often confused with actual sleep time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings underscore the overlooked importance of sleep regularity,” said Prof. Shengfeng Wang, senior author of the study. “It’s time we broaden our definition of good sleep beyond just duration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team confirmed several associations in U.S. populations and identified inflammatory pathways as a possible biological link. Future research will explore causality and assess the impact of sleep interventions on chronic disease outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#09646860567e68676e49667c7d65666662276a6664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mai Wang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://spj.science.org/journal/hds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Health Data Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Mai Wang – Health Data Science&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.34133/hds.0161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Phenome-wide Analysis of Diseases in Relation to Objectively Measured Sleep Traits and Comparison with Subjective Sleep Traits in 88,461 Adults&lt;/a&gt;” by Yimeng Wang et al. &lt;em&gt;Health Data Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phenome-wide Analysis of Diseases in Relation to Objectively Measured Sleep Traits and Comparison with Subjective Sleep Traits in 88,461 Adults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep traits have been suggested to correlate with various diseases, but most evidence is based on subjective sleep measurement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We investigated the associations of accelerometer-derived objective sleep traits with diseases throughout physiological systems to ascertain whether the disease spectrum related to objective sleep traits differs from that related to subjective sleep traits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; In 88,461 UK Biobank (UKB) adults wearing accelerometers, multiple dimensions of sleep were objectively derived: (a) nocturnal sleep duration and onset timing, (b) sleep rhythm (relative amplitude and interdaily stability), and (c) sleep fragmentation (sleep efficiency and waking numbers).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associations with International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision–decoded diseases during follow-up were estimated using the Cox model, and the results were compared with those of a published literature search of subjectively measured sleep traits and diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data were used to validate the newly identified associations unreported by previous studies. For the meta-analysis-reported associations (with subjective sleep traits) that were negative (with objective sleep traits) in our study, reanalysis was done in UKB with subjective sleep traits, stratified by objective measurements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; During the average 6.8-year follow-up, 172 diseases were associated with sleep traits. Among them, 42 showed at least doubled disease risk, including age-related physical debility (lowest versus highest quartile of relative amplitude, hazard ratio [HR] = 3.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.25, 5.02), gangrene (lowest versus highest quartile of interdaily stability, HR = 2.61, 95% CI: 1.41, 4.83), and fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver (sleep onset timing ≥0030 versus 2300 to 2330, HR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.42, 4.67).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 92 diseases had &amp;gt;20% burden attributable to sleep, such as Parkinson’s disease (37.05%, 95% CI: 21.02%, 49.83%), type 2 diabetes (36.12%, 95% CI: 29.00%, 42.52%), and acute kidney failure (21.85%, 95% CI: 13.47%, 29.42%). Notably, 83 (48.3%) disease associations were sleep rhythm specific, distinct from existing subjective-measure literature that focused on sleep duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reanalysis in UKB showed a contamination of objectively short sleepers in self-report long sleepers, which induced false-positive associations in subjective meta-analyses, including for ischemic heart disease and depressive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newly identified associations of sleep rhythm with 4 diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes were successfully replicated in NHANES. A mediation analysis showed that inflammatory factors including leukocytes, eosinophils, and C-reactive protein contributed significantly to all these newly identified sleep–disease associations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt; Objective sleep traits showed a disease spectrum similar to but not identical to that of subjective sleep traits. Objective measurement can be a useful complement to sleep–disease studies as it may help overcome false-positive associations caused by misclassification bias of some subjective measurement such as sleep duration. Comprehensive control of multiple sleep traits may be important for health as substantial disease burden was attributed to different sleep traits.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 17:06:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE5PUF9KWThXQ0V4R1NRbTJvVTRMUWZNSGFKR3huVkhIOXFSZjBOY3pfcExWZGtBWGR5SmFJTEI1VkIxS3BpX1BHZ2VvcU1jYnhWdFlPMjV0N3BYYTBqTXpBRV9GcUVZT0N4</guid></item><item><title>科学家可能已经在我们的直觉中找到了人类的第六感- AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE1tRkRqeXdnMkdDNnN4RGl3NnNLMFlUM0c2Qi1YeXQ2bllCc0JtZUZzU2ItSnRweFM0YlZHejJ2dzdtaGQ1N3VRdk5XSnhLNjlGZ2xxS2xvSEU0MVBtX1c3MHd5eXpoakZhM3Q1RE8xOUdHSW90YVUwcXJB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Scientists May Have Found Humanity’s Sixth Sense&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Yuichiro Chino - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study says that the organisms in our gut have more direct influence on our actions that we previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists analyzed an ancient protein called flagellin, released from the tail of bacteria (known as the flagella), and found that the gut’s neuropods could sense this protein, triggering an appetite-suppressing response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team hopes that a greater understanding of what impacts the microbiome could help experts develop treatments for obesity and psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science textbooks typically describe humans as having five senses—&lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a64655992/regenerate-retina-sight/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:seeing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;seeing&lt;/a&gt;, smelling, hearing, seeing, and touching. While it’s true these are the most outward and &lt;em&gt;obvious&lt;/em&gt; senses, they’re far from the only ones. For one, there’s proprioception, which describes the body’s ability to sense its position and movement in space—that may not seem like a big deal, but if you live without it, poor balance &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness/proprioception#symptoms" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:is only the beginning of your problems;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;is only the beginning of your problems&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now, a new study led by scientists at Duke University suggests that there’s yet &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; sense lurking in our gut. This is the home of the microbiome—a collection of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea that impact our &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/a64673758/snake-man-antivenom/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:immune system;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;, our digestion, and even our mental health. And it’s within this microbiome that bacterial flagella (the tail-like structure bacteria use to swim) release an ancient protein known as “flagellin.” This new study, published yesterday in the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09301-7%23Sec9&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Fhealth%2Fa65503221%2Fneurobiotic-sense%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:journal Nature;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, describes the flagellin as the method through which neuropods, essentially neurons in your gut, regulate appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the scientists, neuropods contain a receptor known as “toll-like receptor 5,” or TLR5, which then sends impulses to the brain via the vagus nerve—the gut-brain information highway that is also the longest nerve of the body’s autonomic nervous system. This shows how &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a62544952/two-billion-year-old-microbes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:microbes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;microbes&lt;/a&gt; living in our gut can communicate with the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were curious whether the body could sense microbial patterns in real time and not just as an immune or inflammatory response,” Diego Bohórquez, the senior author of the study from Duke University, said in a press statement, “but as a neural response that guides behavior in real time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the idea, scientists fasted mice overnight, and when supplied with a dose of flagellin to the colon, the mice ate less than expected. When the same experiment was conducted with mice that lacked the TLR5 receptor, the mice ate their fill and quickly gained weight. This suggests that this microbe-to-brain communication pathway plays a role in giving &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a65255851/synthetic-genome/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:humans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;—and other mammals—the “I’m full” sense. This is what the researchers call our “neurobiotic sense,” and it very well could be our sixth sense. Or, maybe seventh? Or eighth? We’ve lost count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the microbiome is an immensely chaotic environment, containing some 100 trillion microbial &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a65398598/beating-cell-death-with-anti-necrotics/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cells;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; that can all be influenced by diet, lifestyle, and environment. The next step for the scientists is to figure out what diets change the microbiome and in what ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking ahead, I think this work will be especially helpful for the broader scientific community to explain how our behavior is influenced by microbes,” Bohórquez said in a press statement. “That could be a key piece of the puzzle in conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a23132898/states-with-highest-obesity-rates/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; or psychiatric disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 16:52:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE1tRkRqeXdnMkdDNnN4RGl3NnNLMFlUM0c2Qi1YeXQ2bllCc0JtZUZzU2ItSnRweFM0YlZHejJ2dzdtaGQ1N3VRdk5XSnhLNjlGZ2xxS2xvSEU0MVBtX1c3MHd5eXpoakZhM3Q1RE8xOUdHSW90YVUwcXJB</guid></item><item><title>40岁后不运动燃烧腹部脂肪的4个简单变化-吃这个不是那个</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE5hWlBGQnJHcXNSV1JCeUkwMTdEZ0ltQkxPZHNTR0l1VjUzS3BFLTR5b2JYR0F2YlFpMVI2S0kwSGNaYXc1M0I0ZERYYkRXSl9XMDRDNVc2aXhwRlZIcXZySHZlajU4MXNVblVIS2lMV0VuUkU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content single-post-content"&gt;
										
					
					
					&lt;p&gt;As you age, taming your waistline becomes even more frustrating due to metabolic changes, hormonal shifts, and redistribution of body fat. Testosterone, estrogen, and growth hormone levels decline, decreasing your body’s ability for fat to gravitate to more metabolically active areas, such as your limbs or hips. Instead, stubborn fat goes straight to your abdomen—&lt;i&gt;ugh&lt;/i&gt;. But there are certain simple daily habits you can add to your routine that &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/5-bodyweight-exercises-that-burn-more-belly-fat-than-gym-workouts-after-40/" target="_blank"&gt;burn belly fat&lt;/a&gt; without even working out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Waistlines can creep up by around 0.7cm a year, which can be more pronounced in women. But here’s the upside: This type of fat responds well to lifestyle tweaks, like strength training, protein-rich meals, and stress support,” says &lt;b&gt;Josie Porter&lt;/b&gt;, senior registered dietitian with &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://simple.life/" target="_blank"&gt;Simple Life App&lt;/a&gt;, an award-winning, AI-powered weight loss and health coaching platform.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/best-proteins-to-reduce-belly-fat/" target="_blank"&gt;Visceral fat&lt;/a&gt;—the dangerous kind of belly fat that surrounds your organs—is quite responsive to dietary and lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the goal is to improve overall health and reduce long-term risk, targeting visceral fat delivers the biggest clinical impact and the fastest metabolic return,” explains &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/c-vivek-lal-md-faap-20183913/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. C. Vivek Lal, M.D., FAAP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, founder and CEO of &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://resbiotic.com/pages/science?srsltid=AfmBOorAAPRmpLPF8sZ99QMplXcevB5H-KA7ZBSwircmyuvCRSlWMjiD" target="_blank"&gt;Resbiotic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, Porter and Dr. Lal share a few essential daily habits that melt belly fat without working out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.eatthis.com/standing-exercises-belly-fat-no-floor/"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; is part of a healthy lifestyle, there are simple daily habits we can practice that can have a significant impact on our metabolic health and belly fat,” Dr. Lal shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Porter and Dr. Lal stress the importance of building your meals around &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/healthy-proteins/" target="_blank"&gt;high-quality sources of protein&lt;/a&gt;, like eggs, Greek yogurt, fish, and lentils. This will help you maintain muscle as you age and boosts calorie burn during digestion, making fat loss more seamless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Protein supports appetite regulation, blood sugar control, and lean muscle mass, which are all essential for fat metabolism,” Dr. Lal says. “Starting your day with a high-protein breakfast helps reduce cravings and increases thermogenesis (your body’s natural calorie-burning process). Aim for at least 20 to 30 grams of protein per meal on average.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to perform a super intense workout in order to reap the rewards of physical activity. Simple daily movements can make a major difference in your fat-loss efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyday movements, like walking during calls, standing while working, stretching, or pacing can meaningfully improve fat metabolism,” Dr. Lal explains. “NEAT is especially helpful in reducing visceral fat and improving insulin sensitivity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimizing your nighttime routine to promote solid Z’s is an essential part of an all-around healthy lifestyle. Factors like sleeping in a cool, dark room and limiting blue light usage before bed can make all the difference in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Aim for seven to nine hours of quality sleep,” Dr. Lal recommends. “Poor sleep increases hormones like cortisol and ghrelin, driving hunger and belly fat accumulation. Prioritizing consistent, high-quality sleep improves metabolic function and helps reduce abdominal fat, even without weight loss.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new chemical probe protects healthy cells from DNA damage, preserving them from one of the 8 hallmarks of aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of this potentially paradigmatic development begins where so much of human health begins: the mitochondria. These organelles are disrespectfully monikered as “the powerhouses” of the cell, but they do so much more than just provide cellular energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s so important, it even has its own DNA. &lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is separate from the DNA housed in a cell’s nucleus. While nuclear DNA contains the vast majority of the genetic code, mitochondria carry their own smaller genomes that are essential for cellular functions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;MtDNA exists in multiple copies per cell, but when damage occurs these copies are often degraded rather than repaired. If left unchecked, this degradation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt; can set off a cascade of failures linked to heart conditions, neurodegeneration, and chronic inflammation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="v1p1"&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=u001.7mi9uuAP0Ed-2BNfyXj0eZnjCEMShBsVWOB27mTWd4mujq4SvRsb5U7DEDToT0lDA-2Ft8HCp-2FQz1zKJyr7j-2FATO1EanXopA89jFDzH4Z1ifO9A-3DHO0Y_B6BZnHqZQWKc-2Fye3pBcBpLJBYcfy4QRdfZeMLXkRfBCkBmm8V7nZk3Ec16U2rz0cLpgD-2BwH1YghVqo8AsQqk2-2FTzJ9MwdusVdgAE-2F8h-2FKLBbUbILatV36mu631fVvalv-2BnKqouC1QQzAcUhUrqAMX30aiHfwkHFukkfNFfNMrx7mmSD-2FwtLvmpewMmRPjxl4gDbjoIXAU7X8L0wob00hUoMfXBaBCfFltGGRY8g36JvaO1nnfx5YrYzirXUgssVi8TAFVhRgD2ssNYXd-2F7fo-2BImSHYhgrtN-2Bm3ZsxHJv9QyjincFA-2B5jRlgH6ZyHZIUS4-2BBECq9Pj-2FqLiwVgnOnH8m7rEjE4uHmHModUKVqenWZElVBu7phBwuOcR-2Fw1CXFd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Published&lt;/a&gt; in the German Chemical Society journal &lt;em&gt;Angewandte Chemie&lt;/em&gt; International Edition, researchers at UC Riverside developed a chemical probe that binds to damaged sites in mitochondrial DNA and blocks the enzymatic processes that lead to its degradation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="v1p1"&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;“There are already pathways in cells that attempt repair,” &lt;a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2025/07/21/chemical-shield-stops-stressed-dna-triggering-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Linlin Zhao, UCR associate professor of chemistry, who led the project. “But degradation happens more frequently than repair due to the redundancy of mtDNA molecules in mitochondria. Our strategy is to stop the loss before it becomes a problem.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="v1p1"&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;The new molecule includes two key components: one that recognizes and attaches to damaged DNA, and another that ensures it is delivered specifically to mitochondria, leaving nuclear DNA unaffected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="v1p1"&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;In lab tests as well as studies using living cells, the probe significantly reduced mtDNA loss after lab-induced damage mimicking exposure to toxic chemicals such as nitrosamines, which are common environmental pollutants found in processed foods, water, and cigarette smoke. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="v1p1"&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;In cells treated with the probe molecule, mtDNA levels remained higher, which could be critical for maintaining energy production in vulnerable tissues such as the heart and brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="v1p1"&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;Mitochondrial DNA loss is increasingly linked to a range of diseases, from multi-organ mitochondrial depletion syndromes to chronic inflammatory conditions such as diabetes, Alzheimer’s, arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. When mtDNA fragments escape from mitochondria into the rest of the cell, they can act as distress signals that activate immune responses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="v1p1"&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;“If we can retain the DNA inside the mitochondria, we might be able to prevent those downstream signals that cause inflammation,” Zhao said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE AGING SOLUTIONS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Man’s Biological Clock Set Back 10 Years After 93 Days Living Under the Ocean in a Research Station" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/mans-biological-clock-set-back-10-years-after-93-days-living-under-the-ocean-in-a-research-station/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Man’s Biological Clock Set Back 10 Years After 93 Days Living Under the Ocean in a Research Station&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="v1p1"&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;Importantly, the researchers found that the protected DNA remained functional, despite being chemically tagged. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="v1p1"&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;“We thought adding a bulky chemical might prevent the DNA from working properly,” Zhao said. “But to our surprise, it was still able to support transcription, the process cells use to turn DNA into RNA, and then into proteins. That opens the door for therapeutic applications.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="v1p1"&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;The project builds on more than two years of research into the cellular mechanisms that govern mtDNA processing. While additional studies are needed to explore clinical potential, the new molecule represents a paradigm shift.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE AGING SOLUTION: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Psychedelic Mushrooms Reduced Human Cellular Aging by 57%, Increased Lifespan in Mice 30%" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/psychedelic-mushrooms-reduced-human-cellular-aging-by-57-increased-lifespan-in-mice-30/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Psychedelic Mushrooms Reduced Human Cellular Aging by 57%, Increased Lifespan in Mice 30%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, DNA damage makes up two of the 8 hallmarks of aging first outlined in a landmark paper in 2013, which also includes mitochondrial dysfunction as an antagonistic hallmark, i.e. a result of DNA damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="v1p1"&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;“This is a chemical approach to prevention, not just repair,” Zhao said. “It’s a new way of thinking about how to defend the genome under stress.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
