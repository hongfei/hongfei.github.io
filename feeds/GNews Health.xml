Organization at the University of Saskatchewan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The news comes amid one of the worst seasonal flu outbreaks in 15 years – raising the potential for the emergence

She “has health conditions that can make people more vulnerable to illness”, the statement says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The woman was exposed to poultry in a backyard flock that tested positive for H5N1, the CDC report said, adding that she remained hospitalized at the time of the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A man in Mercer county, Ohio, was infected while depopulating, or killing, H5N1-positive poultry at a commercial facility, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.gcph.info/announcements/?action=show&amp;amp;id=2469#:~:text=***%20REVISED%20***%20Guidance%20for,(888)%20456-3405." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the Ohio department of health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The man has been discharged from the hospital “and is now recovering at home”, the CDC report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;So far, there have been 70 confirmed cases of the highly pathogenic avian influenza in the US since it was first detected in cows last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission at this point.

&lt;p&gt;Another Indiana county is reporting its first case of chronic wasting disease (CWD), less than a year after the state's first detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2.5-year-old white-tailed buck in &lt;a href="https://events.in.gov/event/second-positive-case-of-chronic-wasting-disease-confirmed-in-indiana?utm_campaign=widget&amp;amp;utm_medium=widget&amp;amp;utm_source=State+of+Indiana"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Posey County&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tested positive after being harvested by a hunter, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR) said in a news release late last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county is in the southwestern part of Indiana, on the border with CWD-positive Illinois and CWD-positive Kentucky, the far opposite of &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/chronic-wasting-disease/indiana-confirms-its-first-chronic-wasting-disease-detection"&gt;&lt;span&gt;LaGrange County&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where the state's first case was discovered in April 2024. LaGrange County abuts CWD-positive Michigan. The other state that borders Indiana, Ohio, has also reported cases of the fatal neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 2025-2026 deer hunting season, DNR will enhance its surveillance efforts in Posey County and the surrounding counties to determine the extent of disease in this area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"During the 2025-2026 deer hunting season, DNR will enhance its surveillance efforts in Posey County and the surrounding counties to determine the extent of disease in this area," the DNR said. "This will allow biologists to develop a targeted response based on the prevalence of CWD in this part of Indiana. CWD testing will be voluntary for hunters in this area."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cooking doesn't neutralize prions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CWD, a disease of cervids such as deer, moose, and elk, is caused by infectious misfolded proteins called prions, which spread through direct contact and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease isn't known to infect people, but some experts fear it could cause illness similar to another prion disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("mad cow" disease). The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns against eating meat from infected animals, as cooking temperatures cannot deactivate prions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

An individual from Gaines County who tested positive for the virus visited the university’s main campus, Ripley’s Believe It or Not, Mr. Crabby’s Seafood and Bar and other tourist locations, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The department said that anyone at those locations in the hours between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. CST and at the restaurant between 6 and 8 p.m. should monitor for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Measles is a highly contagious virus that can lead to serious complications, especially in young children and individuals with weakened immune systems. If you think you may have been exposed or are showing symptoms, please contact your healthcare provider immediately,” Metro Health Deputy Director Dr. Anita Kurian said in a &lt;a href="https://www.sa.gov/Directory/News/News-Releases/Possible-Measles-Exposures-in-San-Antonio" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So far, 99 people have been sickened in the outbreak across Texas and New Mexico, leading to a coordinated response from health authorities who are concerned about how many cases have yet to be detected across the region. Many of the cases have come among unvaccinated people as health officials stress the importance of the vaccine to prevent against the disease that has been eradicated in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major measles outbreak has infected nearly 100 people across Texas and New Mexico this year. Health officials believe that more cases will be confirmed (AP)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In San Marcos, less than an hour away from San Antonio, a Gaines County resident visited Texas State University and the Twin Peaks Restaurant on February 14. People near the university from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. and at the restaurant from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. may be at risk of developing measles, health officials warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People in those areas during those times or up to two hours later should monitor for symptoms. The Hays County Health Department said that those who may have been exposed will be notified by their local health authority. State agencies are working together to investigate potential contacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Measles is a highly contagious airborne disease spread by contact with an infected person through coughing and sneezing. Texas is currently experiencing the largest outbreak of measles in decades,” &lt;a href="https://www.hayscountytx.gov/possible-measles-exposure-in-san-marcos" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:noted;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; Hays County Local Health Authority Dr. John Turner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As of last Friday - the state’s latest &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-21-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:update;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; - there were 90 cases reported since January. Sixteen people have been hospitalized and five of the cases were among the vaccinated. Additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area, the Department of State Health Services warned. Of those 90, 57 were in Gaines County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can survive in the air for up to two hours. People in San Antonio and San Marco who were exposed to a positive case are being asked to monitor themselves for symptoms, such as a fever and a rash (AP)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But, the outbreak is no longer just impacting Texas residents. There are now &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nine cases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;nine cases&lt;/a&gt; reported in neighboring New Mexico’s Lea County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The majority of cases in both states are in younger people, between the ages of five and 17 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles, which can survive in the air for up to two hours, can cause serious illness and death. Infections can lead to brain swelling and blindness. And, up to nine out of 10 of those susceptible will get the virus if they have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The best way to prevent infection is two doses of a vaccine against measles. Clinics have been set up in response to the threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Individuals who have not been vaccinated are at greater risk of infection. To minimize the risk of infection and serious illness, individuals should make sure they are vaccinated,” Turner

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There will be 3.2m new cases and 1.1m deaths a year worldwide by 2050 if current trends continue, the study found. In the UK, cases are expected to rise from 58,756 cases a year in 2022 to 71,006 cases a year in 2050. Deaths will jump from 12,122 a year in 2022 to 17,261 in 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The findings were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03502-3" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in the journal Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Every minute, four women are diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide and one woman dies from the disease, and these statistics are worsening,” said the IARC scientist Dr Joanne Kim, one of the authors of the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Countries can mitigate or reverse these trends by adopting primary prevention policies … and by investing in early detection and treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The projected increase in cases worldwide is probably due to a mix of factors, including a growing and ageing global population, improvements in detection and diagnosis, and a higher prevalence of known risk factors for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Factors that increase the risk of breast cancer include getting older, inherited faulty genes and a family history of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Globally, most breast cancer cases and deaths occur in women aged 50 and above, who account for 71% of new cases and 79% of deaths, the IARC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;About a quarter of breast cancer cases can be prevented, the study’s authors said, for example by reducing alcohol intake, maintaining a healthy weight and becoming more active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women worldwide but its burden is not evenly distributed. The IARC said diagnosis rates were highest in Australia and New Zealand, followed by North America and northern Europe, and lowest in Asia and Africa. However, death rates were highest in Melanesia and Polynesia, and in west Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Over the last decade, incidence rates grew by 1% to 5% a year in 27 of 50 countries studied, the IARC said. Importantly, breast cancer mortality rates decreased in 29 of 46 countries analysed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dr Isabelle Soerjomataram, the deputy head of the IARC’s cancer surveillance branch, said: “Continued progress in early diagnosis and improved access to treatment are essential to address the global gap in breast cancer and ensure that the goal of reducing suffering and death from breast cancer is achieved by all countries worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 16:08:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPLVRuWElWVG9zU1k2aG9kVnAtNE9JcVNxXzFCd2NlZlY1eHMwSXRKOGdDMWxwalRTcUhKcXd5YWxYZng1ZDhOTlVRZVFXbDVpZVZSTGhpOTdXR01xMzZuZGhlY0Q4ajZJZVZseG5zeHNEQzhHallQLXNYcWlveFZBYkgwdldsUGJydW00bE9iN3lHZlhiRHRQM3cyMmt3Yjg</guid></item><item><title>Heart disease remains the top cause of death in the U.S. - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxNWDdCWHhsZkdrLWlscE5KLVRvVDlydC1rVTh5Q3VnRmxzRjdLY0ZVN3RRc0hNam00Tmhmd1pMUnA1VTVKSGNrVWZOMGlEeVdkRGNSRUxzaXRHNHRwT3Y1RVV1OXJtRXZLeVRYaVRfM1B5SDFabkhZdXlQYXFmY3N4VXotNVJwQlFxRGtyTW9GN1AwdTlaYVVB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3CLG25UBSJGZ3AZPWBLK3NMNKE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Cardiovascular disease remains&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the leading cause of death in the United States and accounted for 941,652 deaths in 2022, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/-/media/PHD-Files-2/Science-News/2/2025-Heart-and-Stroke-Stat-Update/2025-Statistics-At-A-Glance.pdf?sc_lang=en" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published by the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NQNDS55LIZFYZI5YR4DG27QHZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the United States in 2022, heart disease and stroke killed more people than all forms of cancer and accidental deaths.

Developed by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.bps.org.uk/psychologist/rorschach-test-100" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;in 1921&lt;/a&gt;, the test involves showing a number of inkblots to subjects, then asking them to say what they see. The images are deliberately inscrutable and open to interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;For decades they were popular among psychologists as a way of understanding a person's psyche from the creatures, objects or scenes they perceive in the shapes. It relies upon a phenomenon known as pareidolia, which is a tendency to find meaningful interpretations in things where there is none. It is the same reason why people see faces or animals in cloud formations or on the surface of the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;You might see a butterfly in the image while someone else might see a skull. According to proponents of the test, both interpretations shed light on how you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"When a person interprets a Rorschach image, they unconsciously project elements of their psyche such as fears, desires, and cognitive biases," says Barbara Santini, a London-based psychologist, who uses the Rorschach test with her clients. "The test works because human vision isn't passive, but a meaning-making process shaped by personal experience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But what happens if you have no personal experience, or you offer it to a "brain" that works in an entirely different way?

"Looking closely, I'd say it most resembles a single entity with wings outstretched – perhaps a bat or a moth, with its wings open symmetrically," the chatbot wrote. "The central area could be interpreted as the body, and the details on the sides evoke the texture or shape of wings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"I think that's just rehearsing what it knows of the specific test," says Coen Dekker, a Dutch software developer &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://coendekker.nl/media/pdf/Performing-the-Rorschach-test-with-a-neural-network-v3.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;who a decade ago asked&lt;/a&gt; a neural network, an early version of the technology underpinning AI chatbots today, to complete a Rorschach test. (Dekker's experiment was significantly more simplified because of the technical constraints of the neural networks of the time.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 bBAxiJ"&gt;If an AI's response resembles a human's, it's not because it sees the same thing but it's because its training data mirrors our collective visual culture – Barbara Santini&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"I believe it mainly identifies patterns, shapes, and textures within the blots, and then compares these features to a vast dataset of human responses to generate its interpretation of what it sees in the inkblots," says Ieva Kubiliute, a London-based psychologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;&lt;span id="the-essence-of-humanity" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="the-essence-of-humanity" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;The essence of humanity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"ChatGPT provides interesting, human-like responses, but it is likely not genuinely thinking – instead, it appears to be scanning an online dataset," says Chandril Ghosh, lecturer in psychology at the University of Kent, in the UK, specialising in mental health, AI and treatment. It's similar to the way a musician who has never experienced heartbreak can still write a song that pulls at your heartstrings, simply by analysing how other similar songs like it are structured. Or as Santini, the psychologist puts it, "If an AI's response resembles a human's, it's not because it sees the same thing but it's because its training data mirrors our collective visual culture."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;What we get is a facsimile of reality – and of thought. "ChatGPT can accurately describe emotions without actually experiencing them," Ghosh says. That doesn't make AI useless when it comes to matters of the mind, however. "ChatGPT can understand emotions, describe them, and help others make sense of their feelings," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Ghosh believes that ChatGPT is simply regurgitating random information from its dataset for the benefit of users – which gives the impression of "thinking", but never actually is. Part of the reason why we perceive it possibly as thinking is the way that the tech companies behind these AI chatbots present their products. ChatGPT and tools like it are always helpful, always conscientious, and always conversational. The anthropomorphising of these tools has helped their adoption – but it can muddy the waters around how they – and their outputs – are perceived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp" alt='Estudio Santa Rita The images that an AI "sees" in an inkblot is merely a reflection of the data it has been trained upon (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita)' class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 fxQYxK"&gt;Estudio Santa Rita&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw"&gt;The images that an AI "sees" in an inkblot is merely a reflection of the data it has been trained upon (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;One way of uncovering that unreality is by simply pressing the refresh button, says Ghosh.

They trained an AI algorithm called "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/norman/overview/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;Norman&lt;/a&gt;" – named after Alfred Hitchcock's character Norman Bates – on images from a Reddit group that shares images of people dying in gruesome circumstances. When they showed Norman a set of Rorschach inkblots, the images it described seeing reflected the darkness it had been trained upon. While an algorithm trained on a more normal set of image data would see a group of birds on a tree branch, Norman &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44040008" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;described seeing a man being electrocuted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;It is a stark illustration of just how important the data used to train an AI can be. Train a model using bad data, and the resulting AI will reflect the flaws in that data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kt8qvl.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kt8qvl.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kt8qvl.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kt8qvl.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kt8qvl.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kt8qvl.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kt8qvl.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kt8qvl.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kt8qvl.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kt8qvl.jpg.webp" alt="Estudio Santa Rita AIs are good at spotting patterns in large sets of data but they can also &amp;quot;hallucinate&amp;quot; – making up information that isn't true (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 fxQYxK"&gt;Estudio Santa Rita&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw"&gt;AIs are good at spotting patterns in large sets of data but they can also "hallucinate" – making up information that isn't true (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But what an AI chooses to regurgitate in response to ambiguous stimuli is interesting, says Dekker – in part because of what it says, rather than what it "knows" (AI systems know nothing innately). "It has a general understanding of colour theory and what emotional responses these could give when analysed," says Dekker. "I have a feeling it has a general understanding of the images and what people associate it with. This got me thinking: Wouldn't it be cool if we had – or created – a new set of Rorschach-like images which the model does not know about at all, and let it analyse those?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;While this isn't something Dekker is actively pursuing, we know that AI algorithms do have a tendency to "hallucinate" and invent information that isn't true. But it is also possible force them to hallucinate too. In one experiment by computer scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US, they were able to 3D print a turtle with a particular colour and texture that fooled &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/athalye18b.html" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;a machine vision system into thinking it was a rifle&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, a &lt;a target="_self" href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170410-how-to-fool-artificial-intelligence" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;few stickers on a stop sign&lt;/a&gt; can render it invisible to the algorithm – a potential risk for a self-driving car.

There was no subjectivity in what the AI system was saying when presented with the inkblots, Kubiliute says.

The show captures the exhaustion and desperation many cancer patients feel, and the seductive allure of ditching traditional medicine for the promise of a “natural” cure. It also exposes the dark underbelly of the alternative health industry — a world where quacks and influencers prey on the vulnerable. They speak with unwavering confidence, yet their claims are backed by zero peer-reviewed evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know this all too well ... because I almost fell for it myself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer in December 2022. I immediately began scheduling consultations with surgeons, but most appointments were pushed to mid- or late January because of the holidays. With weeks to wait, I decided to use the time proactively — or so I thought — and met with Dr. T, an integrative medical doctor, to explore if supplements could support my health while I waited for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Dr. T fully backed my decision to pursue surgery, she mentioned another holistic practitioner, Dr. D, who specialized in &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/breast-cancer/thermography" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="thermography" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b764e2e4b050f805a184b9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.healthline.com/health/breast-cancer/thermography" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;thermography&lt;/a&gt;. She explained that thermography — a thermal imaging technique that maps blood flow on the breast’s surface — potentially can identify areas of abnormal heat linked to inflammation or tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;What caught my attention, though, was her offhand remark that Dr. D had allegedly “healed” a breast cancer patient without surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. As a science writer curious about holistic medicine, I was intrigued. Could thermography detect my cancer? I decided to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author shortly before breast-conserving surgery at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I arrived at Dr. D’s office, I noticed that it felt more like a spa than a medical clinic — a welcome change from the windowless rooms with fluorescent lighting where I’d gotten my breast screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thermogram process involved nine thermal images taken with a special camera, followed by a “cold challenge” where I submerged my hands in icy water to test how my body responded. I was told that healthy tissue cools in sync with the brain’s signals, while cancerous or inflamed areas resist the change and show up as hot spots on the thermogram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was fascinated, but I couldn’t ignore the red flags: thermograms &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-warning-letter-clinic-illegally-marketing-unapproved-thermography-device-warns-consumers" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="aren’t FDA approved " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b764e2e4b050f805a184b9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-warning-letter-clinic-illegally-marketing-unapproved-thermography-device-warns-consumers" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;aren’t FDA approved &lt;/a&gt;as standalone tests for detecting breast cancer, and the technician operating the machine turned out to be the doctor’s wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After waiting for 30 minutes for my results — an eternity that left me uneasy — Dr. D finally called me into his office. And then, things took a bizarre turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, he showed me the rainbow-colored thermogram report and acknowledged that it hadn’t detected my cancer — in fact, he seemed visibly flustered by the imaging fail. Instead, it had only revealed “extra heat” in the area, putting me in the “high-risk” category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, he revealed his theory: My cancer was caused by “too many COVID vaccines,” and I shouldn’t get another. I was too stunned to respond. Not only is there zero evidence linking COVID vaccines to breast cancer or other “&lt;a href="https://www.contagionlive.com/view/mrna-covid-19-vaccines-and-turbo-cancer-the-latest-myth-that-won-t-disappear" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="turbo cancers" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b764e2e4b050f805a184b9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.contagionlive.com/view/mrna-covid-19-vaccines-and-turbo-cancer-the-latest-myth-that-won-t-disappear" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;turbo cancers&lt;/a&gt;,” the claim flew in the face of my personal history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What about the fact that my mom had the same type of cancer, in the same breast, at the same age?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He dismissed this outright. “No, it’s definitely the vaccines,” he insisted, before pivoting to his next pitch: Super Mineral Water, a product he sold in his clinic, which he claimed could “detox” my body and possibly help cure me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;By then, I was equally horrified and embarrassed — not just by his quackery, but by my naiveté for walking into this mess. I grabbed my things and left as quickly as I could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author ringing a bell after finishing a month of radiation treatment at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my experience, I turned to the internet and stumbled on some comment boards about thermograms. One post led me to the story of &lt;a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/breast-cancer-survivor-shares-cautionary-tale-relying-solely-60728490" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Morganne Delian" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b764e2e4b050f805a184b9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/breast-cancer-survivor-shares-cautionary-tale-relying-solely-60728490" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Morganne Delian&lt;/a&gt;, a believer in homeopathic medicine who opted for a thermogram instead of a mammogram to detect cancer when she felt a lump in her breast. The thermogram practitioner reportedly told Delian that he couldn’t see a lump but warned she had “mild to moderate risk of developing aggressive breast tissue.” Months later, after finally undergoing a mammogram and a biopsy, she was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories like Delian’s are chilling reminders of the potential dangers posed by unproven screening tools and alternative therapies.

Part of it, I think, is the allure of control in a moment when you feel paralyzed with terror. A cancer diagnosis strips you of your agency — your body feels like a traitor and your treatment plan is dictated by a team of experts that you’ve just met. Alternative medicine offers the illusion of empowerment and personalized care. Quacks don’t bog you down with statistics, side effects or limitations — they offer hope and simplicity. In a world where cancer treatments are scary or difficult to understand, that simplicity and hope can become irresistible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my diagnosis, one of the best things I did was learn to trust my cancer team and the science that guided them. I abandoned my wishful thinking — the fantasy of the “lovely healing experience,” like Milla’s tropical Hirsch retreat in “Apple Cider Vinegar.” Instead, I embraced the stark reality of white hospital walls and a windowless operating room, where my surgeon skillfully removed my tumor and left me cancer free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author and her husband at the D.C.

                    &lt;p&gt;Adding a personalized mRNA vaccine to standard treatment could offer new hope for pancreatic cancer patients, a small yet promising study from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study followed 16 patients, including Barbara Brigham, who joined the trial after a routine scan discovered her early-stage pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside surgery and chemotherapy, patients received a customized mRNA vaccine, designed using their own tumors. Unlike vaccines that aim to prevent disease in the first place, this one aims to help a patient's own immune system fight their cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brigham, a 74-year-old semi-retired librarian from Long Island, didn't hesitate to try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The prognosis was not good when I was diagnosed," she said in a CBS News report. "You know you're going to have a limited amount of time. I just wanted to extend that time." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mRNA vaccine works by targeting genetic mutations found in pancreatic cancer, alerting the immune system to recognize and attack the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During surgery, doctors removed each patient’s tumor and sent it to the German biotechnology company BioNTech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patients then received their personalized vaccine along with immunotherapy and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because "the immune system is hardwired not to recognize our own body," it's typically challenging to teach it to recognize cancer, said surgical oncologist Dr. Vinod Balachandran, who specializes in pancreatic cancer treatment."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 16 patients who participated in the study, eight had a strong immune response, and six of those eight remained cancer-free more than three years later, according to findings published Feb. 19 in the journal Nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, seven of the eight patients who didn’t respond saw their cancer return. The difference seemed to depend on whether the patient’s spleen was removed during surgery, as the spleen plays a critical role in immune function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s still hard to attribute causality to the vaccine alone,” Balachandran cautioned, emphasizing the trial’s small size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Suneel Kamath, a gastrointestinal oncologist at Cleveland Clinic who reviewed the findings, pointed out that the survival rate of the patients in the trial is similar to the survival rate of those with early-stage pancreatic cancer treated with surgery and chemo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This was a nice kind of proof-of-concept study to show that we can make a vaccine for this disease, and it really does actually create an immune response, and an immune response that lasts," Kamath told CBS News. "That's a very nice backbone to build off of." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A larger, randomized trial is now underway, focusing on early-stage pancreatic cancer patients whose spleens are intact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The beauty of mRNA vaccines, as we saw with COVID development, is they're very fast to make. It easy to generate. Once you found a new target, it's very quick to make a vaccine for that particular target," Kamath said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's really exciting, because when we talk about curing cancer, it's not really a single monolithic disease," he added. "There are probably hundreds of different targets for every cancer type. And so the ability to make vaccines against a lot of those different targets very quickly is really powerful." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also exploring mRNA vaccines for melanoma and cancers of the kidney and lung, which they theorize may respond better because of their ability to mutate more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Brigham, the trial gave her exactly what she hoped for -- more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past few months, she welcomed her eighth grandbaby and celebrated her brother's 60th wedding anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The trial was such a wondrous thing," she said. "It has just given me such a renewal in my life. Sometimes it's a little difficult, but it's worth it, absolutely worth it." &lt;/p&gt;


                    

                    
                &lt;/div&gt;

For the last 10 years she hasn't been able to eat a thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead Annie has been forced to survive on IV-administered nutrition to keep her alive. And she has been told her condition is terminal. "When I was a teen, I started struggling with dizziness, fainting spells and digestive issues," Annie said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong with me until eventually a urine and blood test confirmed I had Autoimmune Autonomic Gangliopathy (AAG)." Annie explains that AAG is a lifelong disease that causes her immune system to attack healthy nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Annie's case, the condition has worsened over the years. She has had to have multiple surgeries to remove over 10 feet (3 metres) of her bowel. This has left her with Intestinal Failure, a condition where the intestines cannot absorb enough nutrients and fluids to sustain the body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="image-container" data-redesign-embed="true"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;"It's hard to explain to people what it feels like to never be able to eat," Annie says. "Food is such a normal part of everyday life for most, but for me, it's something I can't even consider. There's a lot of isolation that comes with it. I can't join in on social meals, and the smell of food cooking can make me feel incredibly sick. It's hard to be around something that's a normal part of life for everyone else but a danger to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"At just age 12 I started getting sick, not thinking much of it. By age 15 it was getting worse. I had been back and forth to doctors with numerous issues. By age 16 my life started to change forever. By age 18 I was given a diagnosis. By age 22 I became terminal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I isolated myself from society because I was stuck going through hell whilst everyone moved on with their life's. Spending months and months on end in hospital, going months with no visitors. I didn't want anyone to know I was sick. I just gathered I would get better and I could remove that 'era' from my life. How wrong was I.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I never thought this would be it. I never saw my life ending soon (heck no one does) but not being able to plan or even think about the future just breaks my soul.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Months of horrible torturous symptoms, procedures, surgeries and awful medications. One of those being high dose steroids. Anyone who has had steroids know the awful side effects that come along with it. One of the most obvious moon face and fluid retention. Leaving me sometimes gaining 20 plus kilos in one week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="image-container" data-redesign-embed="true"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The pain, the suffering , the loneliness no one can understand until they have been in that position. Life is so bloody short, and if there's one thing I want everyone to do for me is LIVE! Make the most of every day because the fact you woke up today, the fact you're not stuck in bed is one of the most amazing gifts you can have."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Annie's only lifeline is Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN), a medical treatment where fluid containing essential nutrients, fats, and proteins is delivered directly into the bloodstream. The TPN solution is administered via a Hickman line, a central catheter placed into a large vein near the heart. Every night for 12 hours, Annie is hooked up to an IV drip that runs all night, providing the nutrients her body needs. Without TPN, Annie's body would starve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But living on TPN isn't as simple as it may sound. It requires strict adherence to a sterile setup every time she connects to the drip, as any bacteria entering the Hickman line can lead to &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/what-sepsis-signs-symptoms-treatment-7246541"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt; - a life-threatening infection. "I've become my own nurse at home," Annie explains. "I had to learn to set up my TPN in a completely sterile way. If even a tiny bit of bacteria gets into my line, it can travel straight to my heart."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the years, Annie has endured multiple bouts of sepsis, each one more dangerous than the last. The infections have left her with limited vein access, making placing a new Hickman line harder. She continues: "If I lose this last line, I will enter end-of-life care and will starve to death. It's a terrifying thought. I am now undergoing the removal of all my teeth at once to hopefully prevent further sepsis."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite its life-saving nature, TPN comes at a significant financial cost. The treatment costs Annie between £1,650 and £2,470 every week, and that doesn't include the extra supplies needed to maintain a sterile environment. The costs aside, the psychological strain is a major part of Annie's daily life, as she navigates the reality of a terminal diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="image-container" data-redesign-embed="true"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;"In 2022, my illness became terminal, and I was told that if my heart were to stop, I would not be resuscitated, and I started palliative care. Hearing that news was heartbreaking, but I've tried to focus on making the most of the time I have left," she adds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite her own struggles, Annie is determined to make a difference for others living with TPN. She has launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise awareness and support.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I want to help keep the unit running and provide better facilities," Annie noted. "Right now, the unit is in a small, crowded office in ICU with limited space to care for patients."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The funds raised through her GoFundMe will go towards hiring additional nurses, providing training for medical staff, supporting families of TPN patients, and purchasing essential equipment like a Fibroscanner, which can cost £16,400 to monitor liver health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"My illness may be terminal, but I want my legacy to be about helping others. I'm not giving up. There's so much more I want to do to help others, even if my time is limited," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;scroll-depth-observer data-event-markers="1%,25%,50%,75%,90%,100%"&gt;&lt;/scroll-depth-observer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Mirror</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 12:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE9YbVQzbm5ucGhTQzMtdExNckRHSmc0SjctT1dhZndIT1B5T0ZxZWFlS1IxSC1DaDlOTVRlSEZaQWFsX0F3S1FLRTBwYU5uSUU3eXlXVE9lYjk4c1BNZGlXa1F3d0t6bTBlMThyRzRXdkd3MHMteWFmTNIBfkFVX3lxTE0ydXJud19xQ0ozeG1UZktCOUVwNlNfMlc0ajFvU21QdDNXQmNfMENZUzFTajNocmdUNDFkblVuWVU1UmNlakxtUFpPTTVzWlBUaEFjXy1yd3JJOUFmNXZCVkFBTTliS1dkdl83SFNsVXJtam5GOWJYUW9MZEJsQQ</guid></item><item><title>Want To Know How Fit You Really Are?

You may have overheard the term "VO2 max" at the gym or on a trainer’s social media page recently—but what is this fitness number, exactly?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the ultimate test for your lungs—a measure of how much oxygen your body can take in and use when you're exercising at max effort, says Stacy Sims, PhD, exercise physiologist and author. It’s often considered the gold standard for &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a22995307/cardio-exercises/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardiorespiratory;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cardiorespiratory&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; fitness—think of it as your personal record for oxygen consumption. The higher your VO2 max, the more efficiently your body churns out energy, which can mean better endurance, stronger performances, and a whole lot more stamina, says Sims. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re trying to crush a 5K, keep up in a HIIT class, or just feel less winded on the stairs, your VO2 max plays a major role. So, how do you figure out yours? And more importantly, how can you improve it? Keep reading for the full breakdown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/drstacysims/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stacy Sims;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Stacy Sims&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, is an exercise physiologist and the author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ROAR-Fitness-Physiology-Optimum-Performance-ebook/dp/B01AC5JFR6?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.30796655%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Roar: How to Match Your Food and Fitness to Your Female Physiology for Optimum Performance, Great Health, and a Strong, Lean Body for Life.;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Roar: How to Match Your Food and Fitness to Your Female Physiology for Optimum Performance, Great Health, and a Strong, Lean Body for Life.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Stand To Gain By Improving Your VO2 Max&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athletes obsess over VO2 max because a higher measure means intense efforts can be sustained for longer, but you don’t need to be a pro to benefit from a higher VO2 max. Boosting this number can improve your fitness in ways that directly impact your daily life and workout performance. Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier cardio workouts:&lt;/strong&gt; Ever feel winded walking up stairs or during the first few minutes of a run? A higher VO2 max helps your body use oxygen more efficiently, meaning you can sustain effort longer without feeling exhausted, says Sims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better strength training endurance:&lt;/strong&gt; If your heart rate spikes and you gas out quickly during circuit training, supersets, or HIIT, improving VO2 max can help you recover faster between sets and push through tough workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased energy in daily life:&lt;/strong&gt; Your cardiovascular system plays a huge role in how energized you feel. A stronger VO2 max means your body delivers oxygen to muscles more effectively, which can translate to more stamina for everyday activities like chasing after kids, carrying groceries, or just staying alert throughout the day, says Sims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved recovery:&lt;/strong&gt; A higher VO2 max supports faster recovery after workouts, so you’re less likely to feel wiped out after an intense session and can train more consistently, Sims says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better overall health: &lt;/strong&gt;Studies link higher VO2 max levels to lower risks of cardiovascular disease, metabolic issues, and even cognitive decline as you age. It’s one of the strongest indicators of long-term health and longevity, says Sims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Figure Out Your Own VO2 Max&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing VO2 max is where things get a little tricky. The most accurate way to measure it is in a lab setting, says Sims. This involves a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), where you wear a mask and heart rate monitor while running on a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a27408852/hiit-treadmill-workout/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:treadmill;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;treadmill&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or cycling on a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a30345135/stationary-bike-workout/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stationary bike;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stationary bike&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The mask is hooked up to a machine that measures how much oxygen you inhale and how much carbon dioxide you exhale. As the intensity ramps up, your oxygen consumption eventually plateaus—that’s your VO2 max. The final number is recorded in mL/kg/min (milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re serious about getting an exact measurement, check if any gyms or performance labs near you offer VO2 max testing. But let’s be real—that’s not something most people are going to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more practical way to estimate your VO2 max? A fitness tracker or smartwatch. Many devices, like the Apple Watch and Fitbit Ionic, calculate an approximation based on your heart rate and exercise intensity over time. Some brands even rebrand it—Fitbit calls it your “cardio fitness score,” while Apple keeps it simple as VO2 max (you can find yours in the Apple Health app under “All Health Data”). For the average active person, this is the easiest way to track improvements without stepping into a lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Garmin Vívosport&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074KD6XDY?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.30796655%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:246.94 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;246.94 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XR5TRSZ?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.30796655%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:272.45 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;272.45 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fitbit Ionic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074VDF16R?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.30796655%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$299.00 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$299.00 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's considered a good VO2 max for women?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no perfect score for VO2 max—a desirable number really depends on your sport or main fitness activity, says Sims. Elite female cross-country athletes measure around 65 to 70 ml/kg/min, runners are about 60 to 65ml/kg/min, and cyclists are around 55 to 60 ml/kg/min, says Sims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, though, this VO2 max chart notes where optimal scores should fall depending on your age:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;(From McArdle Katch, Katch, 2003)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Jewelyn Butron&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Factors That Impact VO2 Max&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a22995307/cardio-exercises/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardio fitness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cardio fitness&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; level isn't the only thing that plays a role. There are actually a number of internal and external factors that can have a major impact on your VO2 max, Sims says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="caas-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetics:&lt;/strong&gt; Yep, just like with anything, genes are key to your VO2 max. "Genetics is said to play a 20 to 30 percent role," says Sims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age:&lt;/strong&gt; "After the age of 25 VO2 max decreases by 1 percent a year," Sims says. "The good news is regular physical activity throughout life can offset much of the decline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training volume:&lt;/strong&gt; "Athletic training can alter a person's VO2 max as much as 20 percent depending on their lifestyle and fitness habits," says Sims. In other words, the more sedentary your lifestyle, the lower your VO2 max results will likely be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise mode of testing:&lt;/strong&gt; The method of fitness used during a VO2 max test can also alter the findings—a treadmill test may yield different results than, say, cycling or swimming. "&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a27408852/hiit-treadmill-workout/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Treadmill running;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Treadmill running&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to produce the highest values," says Sims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender: &lt;/strong&gt;Since women are generally physically smaller than men, their VO2 max values are on average 15 to 30 percent lower, says Sims. "That's because women have smaller hearts, lungs, and less hemoglobin, therefore, less oxygen uptake and delivery capacity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body composition: &lt;/strong&gt;A major reason for the differences in VO2 max between men and women is attributed to body composition, or the ratio of lean muscle mass to body fat. But that said, if you were to compare a woman and man with similar physical characteristics (age, training status, and body composition), there wouldn't be a huge difference, says Sims. It's also important to note that VO2 max decreases as body fat percent increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Altitude: &lt;/strong&gt;If you're high up in the mountains, your VO2 max will be different than at sea level. That's simply because there is less oxygen to consume at higher altitudes, and as a result, your ability to take in oxygen decreases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Improve Your VO2 Max&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to boost your VO2 max is through &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g19988771/high-intensity-interval-training/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high-intensity interval training;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;high-intensity interval training&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (HIIT)—workouts that push you to work hard for short bursts, followed by recovery. This kind of training improves your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a28652016/aerobic-vs-anaerobic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:aerobic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;aerobic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; capacity by gradually increasing how efficiently your body uses oxygen, says Sims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can track your VO2 max regularly, it can be a great way to gauge your fitness progress over time. The good news? You don’t need fancy equipment or elite-level training to improve it. Here are some simple ways to level up your VO2 max:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try HIIT workouts&lt;/strong&gt;. Short, intense intervals (like sprinting for 30 seconds, then walking for 60) can help increase your aerobic capacity over time. Aim for two to three HIIT sessions per week, each lasting 20 to 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporate steady-state cardio&lt;/strong&gt;. Longer, moderate-paced runs, swims, or cycles (think 45 to 60 minutes at a conversational pace) help improve endurance and heart health. Experts recommend &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a44868963/zone-2-cardio/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:two to four cardio sessions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;two to four cardio sessions&lt;/a&gt; per week, depending on your training goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add incline or resistance&lt;/strong&gt;. Walking or running on an incline or cycling with resistance forces your heart and lungs to work harder, building aerobic strength. Try one to two sessions per week, either as a dedicated workout or tacked onto a steady-state or HIIT session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay consistent&lt;/strong&gt;. Training regularly, even at lower intensities, helps keep your cardiovascular system strong and improves your overall fitness. A mix of three to five aerobic training sessions per week—at varying intensities—will help keep your VO2 max trending upward, says Sims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, while VO2 max is a useful metric in research and for elite athletes, Sims recommends not obsessing over it. Instead, focus on gradually pushing yourself in &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a22995307/cardio-exercises/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:workouts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;workouts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to get fitter and faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking for a place to start?

Some patients don’t want therapy for their cancer, preferring to spend as much time at home with family as possible.

Some news outlets urged consumers to throw out their &lt;a href="https://img.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/12/17/black-plastic-kitchen-tools-toxic-replacement/" target="_blank"&gt;black plastic spatulas&lt;/a&gt;, which could be contaminated with recycled electronic waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XOZVEAEXUZBQLHAOJERA64NAZQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the study made an error, calculating the level the Environmental Protection Agency considers “safe” for one particular chemical at a tenth of what the agency actually recommends. The researchers have issued a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/12/17/black-plastic-kitchen-tools-toxic-replacement/" target="_blank"&gt;correction&lt;/a&gt; to address this miscalculation, but the mistake caused many to question whether black plastic was as dangerous as they thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J7GRCPRQNZCUTIK6UWQK25EBVI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Experts, however, say that the debate over the study — and over black plastic kitchen utensils — misses the point. The so-called safe level of flame retardants, they argue, is based on old science that doesn’t account for how different chemicals can accumulate&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QHG6LKAZVZHZDMKFB34PUNIRFU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The problem is not whether a single black plastic spatula can exceed the safe level — but whether that level should be considered safe at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4AVNCD5EMZGA7LBF2XV3N5K4OI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The reference dose is not a safe level,” said Tracey Woodruff, a professor of reproductive sciences at the University of California at San Francisco. And, she added, flame retardants accumulate in household dust and bodies over years and years — making it even more crucial to get the regulation right.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“If you make a mistake, your mistake is forever,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RQ3CWVEU4RAVVPM4VYQE6VOY6I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Scientists have known for years that flame retardants are dangerous to human health. PBDEs, or polybrominated diphenyl ethers, are a particularly harmful class of flame retardant that have been found to reduce children’s IQ, boost cancer rates and contribute to thyroid disease. To the body, PBDEs resemble thyroid hormones — and if thyroid hormones are askew, that affects brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4BFD3UEHIVHCJOM2LAYWJBIFQA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp1632" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from Woodruff and her colleagues estimated that every 10-fold increase in PBDE exposure in a pregnant mother produces a 3.7-point IQ drop in her child once it’s born. “We can definitively say that they harm neurodevelopment,” said Woodruff. “They harm the developing brains of babies.” In another study, researchers found that people with the highest rates of PBDEs were four times more likely to die of cancer compared with those with the lowest levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ASJQLLATCVDPPDI7YIUBNWAN7Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These flame retardants used to be in many products, especially in California, where a 1975 state law required furniture to be fire-resistant. Now, however, they’ve largely been phased out except in electronics, where overheating batteries and circuit boards can create a fire risk. Those electronics, researchers &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160412018302125" target="_blank"&gt;have shown&lt;/a&gt;, are now being recycled into the black plastic used for kitchen utensils, toys and other household items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OCVKTI4MNVDV7NJEVSZLJTF2RY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The problem, researchers say, is that no one really knows what a “safe dose” of these flame retardants might be — and putting&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;them in black plastic gives them a second life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HFZIJ3KQRRCMZFDHKRCG2CUPJI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the study published last year, researchers found high levels of flame retardants in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/10/05/have-black-plastic-your-home-it-could-expose-you-toxic-chemicals-researchers-say/" target="_blank"&gt;slotted pasta spoons, sushi trays and children’s black plastic beads&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, researchers noted that some items could approach the EPA limit of 42,000 nanograms a day for a person weighing around 132 pounds. But they clarified in a correction a few months later that the EPA limit is 420,000 nanograms per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TBSTKRQU75G5LDMKI3SSPLU52E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Megan Liu, co-author of the study, says the correction doesn’t fundamentally change the study’s results — they still found flame retardants in many household items, and in much higher quantities than most people would be comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EK5ICOZOWBG7PJ3RCK7RNDC52I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers have also questioned whether that federal exposure limit is accurate. “It’s an old number,” Liu said, pointing out that the safe dose was last evaluated almost 20 years ago, before most of the scientific research on PBDEs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JK5OXDSLLVARPH5CCPLCYO5IHY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That safe dose also accounts for only one specific type of PBDE. But people are exposed to dozens of different flame retardants and other toxic chemicals every day. One type might be accumulating in household dust, while another might be leaking out from a black plastic sushi tray. While using a black plastic spoon to scoop pasta might not&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;mean you’re ingesting chemicals over the approved limit, the combination of that and all your other activities might.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T64UUN5YFBBSHLZPDVRBBCFIZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Our regulatory framework is set up chemical by chemical,” said Heather Stapleton, a professor of environmental chemistry at Duke University. “I personally would like us to look at exposures as whole.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3ECDP7ZHGBC4JA6MQ6TNFEQEDE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Woodruff says the safe doses are based on lab experiments that often use adult, healthy animals — and that might not capture the risks faced by more vulnerable people, like infants or pregnant women. “It’s portrayed as zero risk, but that’s simply not true.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="27GU5MBGB5D2DMNLI4BT63IU4A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At the same time, it is hard for scientists and consumers alike to know which kinds of specific flame retardants are in electronics or furniture, since companies are not legally required to disclose that information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TGQSD4JFLFCCTJN6UUWCRPDSJ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And while researchers can test the concentration of a flame retardant in a particular item, it’s hard for them to establish how much of it might make it from a sofa or a takeout food tray into someone’s body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="S6XTU6NSO5DFPE3EOYVUHBZQDI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Chlorinated tris, a flame retardant used as a replacement for PBDEs, was initially used in children’s pajamas, then phased out when scientists pointed out health risks. But it wasn’t outright banned and continued to be used in furniture, including baby and children’s mattresses. “You’ve got children, infants, babies breathing the air inches above the surface,” said Stapleton. “The fact that this doesn’t have to be disclosed — I find a little bit disturbing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="APBL7OM43JGHZHXIIV4FS4FOYA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Unless regulations change, scientists say, they will be stuck playing a kind of chemical whack-a-mole — knocking out one chemical only to face another that may have the same dangerous health consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C3ITGL2RBNGHVKC4ANKY3KDLKU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers are pushing for a more holistic approach, where the government would look at exposure to many flame retardants from several sources — not just black plastic. But progress has been slow, and many people still show evidence of toxic exposure.

New York State has banned PBDEs in televisions, she pointed out, and the European Union has put strict limits on their use in most consumer products. “This chemical is being banned in televisions,” she said. “Why should we be okay with it in the products that are touching your food or that your children are playing with?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 11:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPNzFaY3pPdUxRbGUzVVlhaEp4cHhGczM5OWxCNTZnLVZzbk10Y3djaWNQdzBhb0VUbUJYOGtjdFNPQnU4SHpNQ1gxdkRobF9iTmhRLTJaR1paNzRsaXRTRnpEc1Y0ZjU3Z2lVQUxsTFZUQWtxWXFqOWoxUWhNYUZJMTV6clN6TXY3ZVBpdFh6ajlfM2xYWnQxNEdYM0hqU1ZCTWgycXhHUGJCOFIz</guid></item><item><title>You're not depressed - but you may have this condition that you've never heard of, reveals DR MAX PEMBERTON - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNWDhqczNNVnpWU190b3NBSUJJeXhncVpYNG11RlJlVDFqdjJrTFcwZklDZm9rVGFYMWpHb3E4aUk5R2RBdEtYd3E1SFJpMEZJZjVVVmUwZEtwM094cm8wX2RPN0hhdjlCNElTQ1RZQ1dlb1BwV0FlX0E4emI0TWoxT1VIWEZUbVY3YmktRzBuM1VyYk5tOC0wdFVHSTNNLWs2QUtpdXQxaTdIM1NvMHM5UjJjVHJvc2pGNFliLTFwNFlnNDNVVHFhZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Do you often feel down, or view the world from a ‘glass half-empty’ perspective? Frequently feeling ‘fed up’ is certainly an unhappy way to go through life, but did you know, according to recent research, it could actually make a significant difference to whether or not you fall ill and even die prematurely?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists at &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/oxford-university/index.html" id="mol-a11a83d0-f211-11ef-a154-c36c30f7afa6"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt; tracked half a million people in the UK and studied the effects of a range of ‘modifiable’ environmental factors – meaning the harm could be prevented – on several diseases including cancers of the breast, lung, prostate, ovaries, colon, pancreas, liver, oesophagus and blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some factors – such as smoking, poor diet, living in a deprived area and exercise levels – may come as little surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But I was particularly struck that someone’s attitude to life can also affect them so profoundly that it can actually significantly increase their risk of premature death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s well known that severe &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-a1163e10-f211-11ef-a154-c36c30f7afa6"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; is a serious condition that ruins lives and requires medical help. Yet apart from this there are also a lot of people who, although not clinically depressed, find themselves nevertheless blighted by negativity they can’t shake off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a condition known as ‘dysthymia’ – persistent, low mood that brings with it little interest in life, a general sense of unfulfillment and a lack of productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sadly, because it doesn’t tend to interfere with day-to-day life in the way that depression does, those affected often don’t seek treatment – and family and friends just dismiss them as being ‘a bit of a grump’ or a ‘misery’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rather like Eeyore from A A Milne’s Winnie-the-Pooh, everything always seems to be downbeat for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;There are also a lot of people who, although not clinically depressed, find themselves nevertheless blighted by negativity they can't shake off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They may not be classically depressed, but simply live their lives under a permanent shadow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet this latest research underlines the vital importance of addressing low mood and the effects it can have on health, wellbeing and your lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it’s all very well knowing that you need to change your attitude – it’s another thing being able to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One effective way can be using cognitive behavioural therapy, or CBT. This is a form of talking treatment, available on the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-642e0fb0-f215-11ef-a154-c36c30f7afa6"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;, that research shows can help people to alter their perspective on the way they live their lives by challenging and changing negative and unhelpful thoughts and behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, if you’re feeling down in the dumps and find life a grind, don’t put up with it –because help is at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Your GP can refer you for CBT but in the meantime, here are some simple suggestions that I have found to be helpful for my own patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;WRITE IT ALL DOWN ON PAPER&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing your worries down helps you clarify what is on your mind. Make a list of everything that seems hard to deal with in one column – and in another jot down ideas that might help to address these or improve things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You might not be able to come up with answers to everything but you should be able to find solutions that may help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This will help dispel any feelings of hopelessness, which are a hallmark of negative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;CHALLENGE YOUR ASSUMPTIONS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can be easy to mistake negative thoughts for fact – so you need to challenge them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you start to think ‘I feel really depressed’, make an effort to challenge this by telling yourself: ‘It’s normal for moods to go up and down. This will pass.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;TRAIN YOURSELF TO THINK POSITIVELY&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thinking positively takes practice. As soon as you have a negative thought, make yourself pause and think of three positive things to counter it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, if you are served a dish you don’t like, rather than allowing yourself to dwell on it, concentrate on how nice it is to have someone cook for you, the pretty pattern on the plate and the delicious dessert you’ll be having afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; If you keep doing this you’ll find that eventually more upbeat thoughts will come naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;ALWAYS COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of each day, look back over what happened and identify at least three things that went well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;We all have a tendency to dwell on our mistakes and the problems we encountered. But every day is full of good elements too, if we only train ourselves to look for them. Over time, it will become a habit and each day will start to appear brighter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;LEARN TO ACCEPT DISAPPOINTMENT&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Having a positive outlook isn’t about being relentlessly upbeat. It’s normal to have disappointments in life, but what matters is how you approach them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Accept that it happened and try to learn from it. One tip is to write down the disappointment, what happened and what was within your control to do differently. This will help you move on and put into perspective your own part in things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Emma’s trauma is all too real &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/sport/emma-raducanu/index.html" id="mol-644c1f00-f215-11ef-a154-c36c30f7afa6"&gt;Emma Raducanu&lt;/a&gt; posted a statement on Instagram after being left in tears last Tuesday when a ‘fixated’ man was removed from the crowd during a second-round tennis match in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/dubai/index.html" id="mol-6435d7e0-f215-11ef-a154-c36c30f7afa6"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt;, which she later lost. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Emma Raducanu had a frightening experience when she spotted a 'fixated' man in the crowd at a tennis match in Dubai&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Although we know little about the background to the incident, the distress it caused to poor Emma was all too clear to see. It reminded me of a time a few years ago when I was bothered by a very persistent patient.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt; Although such incidents are often not pursued by the police, it is important to recognise that a pathologically intense focus on someone else can quickly escalate with consequences. That is because many of those who behave in this way have profound mental health problems and psychological difficulties. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;The emotional toll on the victim can drag on for years, devastating all aspects of their lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The Government is cracking down on vape use and also conducting a social media campaign to dissuade people from taking it up. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;But while it’s clear the habit isn’t good for children, it’s not so clear for adults.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt; In 2020, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found 2,807 cases of vape-associated lung injury(EVALI) and 68 deaths attributed to it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;But most EVALI cases were in people who had modified their vape to smoke THC (cannabis). I fear the move by the Government risks scaring adults off vapes – and back to smoking cigarettes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Dr Max prescribes... learning a language &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Being able to speak a second language increases the size of your brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;We have known for a while that people who speak a second language develop dementia over five years later than &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;those who can’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;A study has found out why – having another language increases the size of the brain, meaning it has greater reserves if it develops problems. Brain efficiency is also improved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite worries about the efficacy of such schemes, NHS trusts are still recruiting DEI (diversity, equality and inclusion) staff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many are hired on twice the pay of a junior doctor. Yet the evidence for DEI is flimsy. How can the NHS justify this waste? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 11:20:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNWDhqczNNVnpWU190b3NBSUJJeXhncVpYNG11RlJlVDFqdjJrTFcwZklDZm9rVGFYMWpHb3E4aUk5R2RBdEtYd3E1SFJpMEZJZjVVVmUwZEtwM094cm8wX2RPN0hhdjlCNElTQ1RZQ1dlb1BwV0FlX0E4emI0TWoxT1VIWEZUbVY3YmktRzBuM1VyYk5tOC0wdFVHSTNNLWs2QUtpdXQxaTdIM1NvMHM5UjJjVHJvc2pGNFliLTFwNFlnNDNVVHFhZw</guid></item><item><title>Tiny food is one of the world's healthiest and prevents heart disease and cancer - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOVHViRzdCbzRjdk41TW8tNTBLNk81bm11WUJjUWhnTWxnMi01cW1wN2lKQzNWTVhWLW1TRjIxbWdxUmFhTm1JdTlseVRTdUpoWVFPR1htcXVwbmU2V01MUjAwMXRsOURWbWpzYks5alV5U2F6ZXlOcjQyckZpZEVHamF5T3BrSGN60gGOAUFVX3lxTE1wSE1sQTRNUktPd1A2ODZUNFgxeEhONk1RUC0xZlJNcjNXNjVmcHhreTBHZnRhZ1hDSzktVFhMM1lWR2VxMHdBMFF6U01xTzJza0pXdE1zR3ZPMGpqTVdfVzJoWTNlYktKQk1KaWkyb3hoMXhSNWZJM2E3NEx1bEt2RWlVVmJsVlBTMDhMbXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One tiny food has been touted for its &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/health" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;health &lt;/a&gt;benefits for centuries.

&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also contain an essential omega-3 fatty acid called alpha-linolenic acid, which is essential to our health but cannot be made by our bodies, so we must get it from our diet. Chia seeds, which the Aztecs revered, are “high in several nutrients that are important for our bone health, including calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Harvard scientists, chia seeds can also reduce blood pressure, support digestive health, manage weight, protect against chronic disease, and improve anxiety and depression. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chia seeds can be used in weight management because they form a gel-like substance in the stomach that can increase one's feeling of fullness and decrease appetite. Harvard Health states that the fibre in chia seeds can help lower “bad” cholesterol and triglyceride levels and increase “heart-protective HDL” cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31065595" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can incorporate chia seeds into your diet simply by sprinkling them onto foods like yoghurt, cereal, smoothies, and salads or mixing them into pancake batter or other baked goods. Chia pudding, a simple dish that mixes the seeds with milk to create a thick, desert-like consistency, is also very popular.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chia seeds have a mild, nutty flavour that goes well with sweet and savoury dishes, so there are endless ways to enjoy them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The seeds are affordable in most supermarkets&lt;span&gt;, at around £1.20 for 150g. However, Cleveland Clinic explains that you should be careful not to eat too many, as this could cause digestive problems&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you're not drinking enough water, the seeds can absorb the water in your gut, which could lead to constipation, bloating, and gas. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many experts agree that adding one to two tablespoons of chia seeds to your daily diet—while staying properly hydrated—may be an easy way to improve gut health, reduce high blood pressure, stabilise blood sugar, and lower bad cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 10:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOVHViRzdCbzRjdk41TW8tNTBLNk81bm11WUJjUWhnTWxnMi01cW1wN2lKQzNWTVhWLW1TRjIxbWdxUmFhTm1JdTlseVRTdUpoWVFPR1htcXVwbmU2V01MUjAwMXRsOURWbWpzYks5alV5U2F6ZXlOcjQyckZpZEVHamF5T3BrSGN60gGOAUFVX3lxTE1wSE1sQTRNUktPd1A2ODZUNFgxeEhONk1RUC0xZlJNcjNXNjVmcHhreTBHZnRhZ1hDSzktVFhMM1lWR2VxMHdBMFF6U01xTzJza0pXdE1zR3ZPMGpqTVdfVzJoWTNlYktKQk1KaWkyb3hoMXhSNWZJM2E3NEx1bEt2RWlVVmJsVlBTMDhMbXc</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr. Stands in the Way of Polio Eradication - The Bulwark</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPdllXS0pDY0NkVTF6WnJNZHNsNzMwRUFRTEFlN0t2NEVydHByWEQ5eDctZkEwRDJMY3VMY1VxdUlMTURKaXJEZURDZ1UzU25YN1o1bDFoTkh6TDJCSlFlT2VMdkg2Q1RLejZOaVBZNi1kSWRDcXp6ZWU0RDB2RVJoTllMdUFrbFk5OUNN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div dir="auto" class="body markup"&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-image-container"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a1ab735-bc5a-4f2b-8b35-7d78d5597607_4411x2941.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image-caption"&gt;Robert F.

(Photo by Allison Robbert/AFP via Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;THE COVID PANDEMIC THAT REACHED our shores in winter of 2020 has taken more than &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/ciss/2024/02/27/ciss-affiliates-analysis-reveals-many-excess-deaths-attributed-to-natural-causes-are-actually-uncounted-covid-19-deaths/" rel&gt;1.2 American lives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; thus far—a staggering loss, on the one hand, and a tribute to modern medicine on the other. Until well into the twentieth century, the arrival and spread of infectious disease was met with panic, confusion, blame, flight, and ultimately resignation. A significant change occurred following the Second World War, with the development of antibiotics and vaccines for the treatment and prevention of everything from polio to measles, mumps, and tuberculosis. What made the COVID pandemic unique was the “warp speed” with which medical researchers and federal officials responded, working hand-in-hand to develop and manufacture safe and effective vaccines that revolutionized the field while saving untold millions of lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s what makes the confirmation of anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of health and human services so troubling. Americans should be celebrating these milestones and demanding additional resources for the battles ahead. Instead, intense media scrutiny has provided a haul of previously unknown information about Kennedy and his organizations, including &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/health/aaron-siri-rfk-jr-vaccines.html" rel&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that a Kennedy confidant helping to vet candidates for high-ranking HHS positions had petitioned the Federal Drug Administration to withdraw its approval of the inactivated polio vaccine, which has stood for seventy years as the gold standard in the battle against infectious disease. Kennedy has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/senate-confirms-robert-f-kennedy-jr-vaccine-opponent-health-secretary" rel&gt;called for&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a years-long “pause” on infectious disease research, and Elon Musk’s DOGE has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/life-saving-research-risks-being-destroyed-by-the-federal-funding-freeze/" rel&gt;frozen billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in federal grants for basic scientific and medical research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things could still get worse. Will junk science gain a serious foothold in decision-making bodies like HHS and its affiliated agencies? Will childhood vaccines now mandated by law become voluntary, or removed from circulation altogether? Putting a bullseye on the polio vaccine is a clear warning that even the safest, most proven vaccines aren’t safe from Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUT THERE’S MORE TO THE STORY. While the public health community is understandably fearful of attempts to undermine vaccination, there is, in fact, no consensus regarding the global campaign to eradicate polio. Some see it as an impossible task; others view it as a poor use of limited resources; still others believe that containment, rather than eradication, is the proper course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are two types of vaccines used to protect against polio: the injected killed poliovirus vaccine developed by Jonas Salk in the early 1950s, and the live oral poliovirus vaccine pioneered by Albert Sabin a decade later. In tandem, they have eliminated the disease in the developed world and come extremely close in the developing world. Reported cases of paralytic polio in the latter dipped from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/polio#:~:text=As%20you%20can%20see%2C%20several,number%20was%20down%20to%20649." rel&gt;tens of thousands per year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the 1980s to fewer than two thousand by the early 2000s. Today that number is lower still, but global eradication remains elusive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The campaign has been marred by a seemingly endless series of missed deadlines. In 1988, the World Health Organization and Rotary International, a remarkably generous private funder, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://polioeradication.org/about-polio/history-of-polio/#:~:text=Rotary%20International%20launched%20a%20global,1000%20children%20worldwide%20every%20day." rel&gt;resolved&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to end polio before the new century arrived. But problems arose that are yet to be fully solved. It had been known from the outset that the Sabin vaccine could revert to virulence in an infinitesimally small number of cases—about one in 750,000—primarily involving children with weakened immune systems. For that reason, the United States and most of the developed world went back to a more powerful version of the Salk vaccine in the 1990s, even though Sabin’s was cheaper and simpler to deliver.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the early 2000s, the Sabin vaccine appeared to be causing more cases of paralytic polio in the developing world than the wild poliovirus still circulating there. But the numbers were so low, and the vaccine so vital for mass-vaccination campaigns in hard-to-reach places, that it remained the vaccine of choice. The compromise strategy was to use the live poliovirus vaccine, along with a robust surveillance system, to eliminate the transmission of wild poliovirus, at which point the inactivated poliovirus vaccine would be phased in to safely maintain immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A sense of cautious optimism took hold by the first years of the millennium. Two prestigious journals, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, ran article articles under the headlines “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/35053235" rel&gt;Polio’s Last Stand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;” and “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.303.5666.1960" rel&gt;Polio: The Final Assault?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;” In 2007, the Gates Foundation &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.endpolio.org/rotary-and-gates-foundation-celebrate-10-years-of-working-together-to-end-polio" rel&gt;joined the cause&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, contributing more than $5 billion to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative over time. Each succeeding year began with the promise that “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/media-center/press-releases/2022/10/world-health-summit-gates-foundation-commits-over-one-billion-to-end-polio" rel&gt;Polio eradication is within reach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.” But fighting the disease became akin to a game of whack-a-mole: As soon as one area became polio-free, the virus would pop up in another. One observer described the effort as “trying to squeeze Jell-O to death.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2011, Bill Gates called for a “final push” to eradicate polio during an event at the Manhattan townhouse of Franklin D. Roosevelt, a polio survivor, which I attended with great pride. A decade after promises of imminent victory, however, a sense of weariness and defeat had overtaken parts of the public health community. Donald A. Henderson, an iconic figure who had led the successful global campaign to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s, was not immune. Not only did Henderson portray the polio campaign as stuck in neutral, he also saw it as a zero-sum game in which the effort was sapping resources better spent elsewhere. “Fighting polio has always had an emotional factor—the children in braces, the March of Dimes posters,” he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/health/01polio.html" rel&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “But it doesn’t kill as many as measles. It’s not in the top 20.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/kennedy-rfk-jr-polio-eradication-public-health-vaccine?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"&gt;&lt;a class="button primary" href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/kennedy-rfk-jr-polio-eradication-public-health-vaccine?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Henderson’s complaints were echoed by others. “It’s theoretically possible to eradicate polio,” a WHO official &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/wipe-out-polio-experts-give-it-one-last-shot-flna1c9447651" rel&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “Whether or not we can do it is an entirely another matter.” Bioethicist Arthur Caplan, a polio survivor, went a step further, saying that eradication was neither feasible nor essential: “We ought to admit that the best we can achieve is control.” And Richard Horton, long-time editor-in-chief of the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt; Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a leading medical journal, directed some withering criticism in Bill Gates’ direction. “[His] obsession with polio is distorting other priorities,” Horton said , adding: “Global health does not depend on polio eradication.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gates and his allies responded that any slowdown in the campaign would surely cause polio to spread, paralyzing and killing thousands of unvaccinated children. And Henderson did &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/health/15polio.html" rel&gt;change his mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; following conversations with his close friend, Dr. Ciro de Quadros, who had helped to eliminate smallpox and measles (temporarily) in parts of Africa and much of Latin America. What most impressed Henderson, he publicly admitted, was the ironclad commitment of Rotary International and especially the Gates Foundation to keep working and funding until the job was finished.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the twenty-first century now entering its second quarter, the battle to eradicate polio is still in flux. There have been some major victories—India has been polio-free for almost a decade, a monumental task—but civil strife, religious zealotry, the murder of vaccinators, and fear of Western motives and medicine in remote areas have continued to impede mass vaccination programs. To compound matters, the Sabin vaccine requires a minimum of four doses to confer adequate immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I FULLY UNDERSTAND THE SKEPTICISM toward eradication and the feeling that too much time, effort, and money have been directed toward a disease that pales, numerically, in comparison to other afflictions and public health problems. The global campaign to eradicate polio began with a burst of optimism that minimized or ignored dangerous hurdles, no doubt undermining its credibility. Over-promising is rarely a good idea, especially when that promise involves the elimination of an insidious childhood disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How close we are to fulfilling the mission remains in dispute. What is remarkable, however, is the tireless pursuit of the end game. Funding remains strong, the campaign continues to recruit millions of volunteers, and international cooperation, especially among Middle East and African nations, is clearly on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization, coupled with his elevation of RFK Jr., has no doubt hurt the global eradication cause. But Trump himself has sent mixed signals. He recently spoke of friends who have battled polio, while describing the Salk vaccine as “the greatest thing ever,” akin to a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle must continue. Giving up on eradication would be a sign of defeat virtually guaranteed to increase the number of worldwide polio cases while conceding to the arguments of anti-vaxxers that the disease is unworthy of mandatory vaccination anywhere, including the United States. For those of us old enough to remember the scourge of polio before Salk and Sabin, it’s a sobering thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/kennedy-rfk-jr-polio-eradication-public-health-vaccine?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"&gt;&lt;a class="button primary" href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/kennedy-rfk-jr-polio-eradication-public-health-vaccine?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Bulwark</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 10:29:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPdllXS0pDY0NkVTF6WnJNZHNsNzMwRUFRTEFlN0t2NEVydHByWEQ5eDctZkEwRDJMY3VMY1VxdUlMTURKaXJEZURDZ1UzU25YN1o1bDFoTkh6TDJCSlFlT2VMdkg2Q1RLejZOaVBZNi1kSWRDcXp6ZWU0RDB2RVJoTllMdUFrbFk5OUNN</guid></item><item><title>Noticing This While Watching TV Can Be An Early Sign Of Dementia - HuffPost UK</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxNUGhEMDFwbVRRdzZqQUxqOWxZa2lKWWxZV2cxNTQwMkd6ZkphWUdsWU95S042TnRUY3VxNW9wTGpNN0JvNlNmSjJfbVY5b0JDRmliNHQ4RVlaNW0zS1VNYllMaDdPZDFIeXI2aXprM2QzWnFKUDh1T0dNVi1adUNHaTdfZGVaclFlQWpBTkktOGdhV0lWd1gw0gGeAUFVX3lxTE15OGhYZ3lnU3R3RldVeXdIdG5lZ21SX1FpeHJDcjRZemlCeEc3R2pyQW5WY281dUYwWGM4bFFsSjdQSUE0WHN6MTlESEVzWW44MzBkX1BWVGp6c2ZZUDVBeHNCZTUxanZlMFpHbklnNFdVdTQ4c3ZtMlZXSGRINGF6WmlmT3h2bEZ2cWZ6VWhxSmU1WnRqbnR4OWhRc09R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though nearly a million people in the UK have dementia at the moment, &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/blog/how-many-people-have-dementia-uk" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Alzheimer’s Society" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67bc3b34e4b029e3b893ed2d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/blog/how-many-people-have-dementia-uk" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;Alzheimer’s Society&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They intended for their work to be the subject of academic discussion and to spur further study of what they dubbed “post-vaccination syndrome.” Instead, it has exploded online — and become a parable for the ways in which the internet is being used to weaponize basic vaccine research vital to advancing scientific knowledge about the safe use of these key products.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study was released last Tuesday on medRxiv, a so-called preprint server where unpublished studies can be shared before they go through peer review, the process by which other scientists kick the tires, effectively, to help journals decide whether or not submitted research deserves to be published. The senior authors of the paper, immunologist Akiko Iwasaki and cardiologist Harlan Krumholz, both serious scientists, were clear in the press release they issued and interviews with STAT that these are preliminary findings that need much more study. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They both also insisted that they felt a responsibility to their patients to share what they are seeing, in the hopes it would prompt other researchers to investigate, figure out how to make safer Covid vaccines if there truly is a link, and, hopefully, find ways to help people affected by any such condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I just saw people suffering and thought we should follow the science,” said Krumholz, founder of the Yale School of Medicine’s Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation. He stressed he continues to get Covid booster shots, and doesn’t think people should “overindex” what he, Iwasaki, and their co-authors are reporting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think it’s ready to be used in clinical decision-making. So, if anything, I’m just trying to tell people: This shouldn’t be factoring into your decision right now.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is not the message the internet is hearing — or at least the parts of it where people routinely challenge the safety of vaccines. There, news of this paper “is spreading like wildfire,” one critic of the work, Adam Gaffney, an assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Harvard Medical School, noted in &lt;a href="https://x.com/awgaffney/status/1892935347136278841" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a critique&lt;/a&gt; on the social media platform X. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere on X — and beyond — it was held up as proof that millions of people who believe they are suffering lingering illness from Covid infection were actually injured by the vaccine instead. (Many people with long Covid developed the condition before vaccines for the virus were developed.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, and the owner of X, reposted one such claim to his 218.7 million followers. Right-wing influencer Benny Johnson seized on the study as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We tried to warn you. This is completely horrifying,” Johnson said, also on X. “Studies are beginning to prove that the COVID Jab is far worse than COVID — and may in fact be a deadly poison for your immune system. Thousands of people need to go to jail.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One researcher, whose university — like a number right now — has told its academics to stay out of media coverage of political events, expressed exasperation at the scientists behind the study, asking: “Why on earth would you do this now if this is preliminary?” Post-vaccination syndrome “is a term that RFK will love,” this individual said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fact that the broadness of the term could be read to encompass vaccines other than Covid shots, even though the paper only investigated the role Covid shots might be playing in the illness it describes, was also seen by some as a concern. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The term is a problem, it’s a real problem, especially at this political moment,” said Gaffney, who believes the study has multiple shortcomings. “We’re at a moment right now where the U.S. government is undercutting people’s trust in science and vaccinations probably like never before in history. And to coin this novel syndrome without even proving that it’s caused by the vaccine is very worrisome to me.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RFK, obviously, is the new secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a long-time critic of vaccines who has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/22/trump-hhs-secretary-pick-rfk-jr-financial-disclosures-biotech-investments-book-advances/"&gt;earned substantial income&lt;/a&gt; for years speaking and publishing about perceived dangers of vaccines, and bringing vaccine injury lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The paper was posted to medRxiv during Kennedy’s first week at the helm of HHS, when there were &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/"&gt;already signs&lt;/a&gt; that policies promoting vaccines would come under attack. A meeting of a key vaccine advisory group long scheduled for this week &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/acip-cdc-vaccine-meeting-postponed/"&gt;was postponed&lt;/a&gt;, with a new date TBD. There were reports Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;is about to fire&lt;/a&gt; some or all of the existing members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, giving him a chance to name new members to the committee. As it currently stands, Kennedy would not have &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/31/vaccine-policy-acip-members-appointees-hhs/"&gt;openings to fill&lt;/a&gt; on ACIP before 2027. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Into the roiling cauldron of unease about the future of U.S. vaccination policy dropped the Yale paper, comparing a range of biomarkers from 42 previously healthy people who are believed to have developed symptoms after getting a Covid shot to 22 still healthy individuals. Though it’s not yet known whether all the people studied are suffering from the same condition, there seemed to be at least a temporal association between getting vaccinated and developing symptoms like exercise intolerance, excessive fatigue, tinnitus, and brain fog, among others. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most of the people complaining of the symptoms developed them after their first or second Covid shot, though some experienced onset after a third, and in a few cases, a fourth dose of vaccine. There were cases among people who received most of the vaccines used in the U.S. — Pfizer’s, Moderna’s, and a Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine, which was briefly available but &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/coronavirus-covid-19-cber-regulated-biologics/janssen-covid-19-vaccine" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;was withdrawn by the company&lt;/a&gt; in 2023.  &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Oh, no! Really?” groaned an evidently dismayed Iwasaki, when told Musk had amplified a post on X alleging the study proved long Covid is caused by Covid vaccines. “I don’t want anyone to conflate the two different syndromes in one bucket. That is not the message we’re trying to convey.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The incident is a textbook example of something that plagues vaccine safety researchers: a damned-if-they-do-and-damned-if-they-don’t phenomenon. If researchers see evidence that use of a vaccine might be causing harm, they are ethically required to report it and pursue study of it. But public discussion of so-called signals of possible vaccine side effects are quickly weaponized by anti-vaccine forces. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is not uncommon for such signals to turn out to be false alarms, disproven by rigorous study. In the first couple of years after the H1N1 flu pandemic of 2009, there appeared to be &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/09/13/flu-vaccine-pregnancy-miscarriage/"&gt;higher-than-expected rates of miscarriage&lt;/a&gt; among pregnant people vaccinated against the new virus, though only among those who had received the shot in back-to-back years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funded a study to explore the issue over three flu seasons. The conclusion was that the earlier findings had been a statistical anomaly; &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/02/27/new-study-finds-no-link-between-flu-shots-and-miscarriages-allaying-fears/"&gt;there was no increased risk&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X19312447?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;resulting study&lt;/a&gt; was published in the journal Vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some safety signals, however, do prove to be true. The first rotavirus vaccine, to prevent a diarrheal and vomiting disease that afflicts young children, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2094741/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;was withdrawn from the market&lt;/a&gt; when it was linked to an increased risk of developing intussusception, a serious bowel blockage. And the CDC and its vaccine advisory panel have taken &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/26/cdc-rsv-acip-hearing/"&gt;a go-slow approach&lt;/a&gt; with RSV vaccines for older adults, because of an apparent increased risk of developing Guillain-Barré syndrome after vaccination. GBS is a neurological condition involving muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. Most people fully recover, but some sustain permanent nerve damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To conceal possible side effects would be morally wrong and could endanger the health of people who take vaccines to prevent illness. Vaccine safety researchers do what Krumholz and Iwasaki did — they follow the science. But in doing so, and in talking about possible links between receipt of a vaccine and negative side effects before an association is found to be real could be perceived as casting aspersions on individual vaccines and vaccines in general.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Edward Belongia, who was the senior author on both the studies exploring whether vaccination with H1N1-containing shots was elevating the risk of miscarriage in pregnant people, said people who research vaccine safety are well aware of the possibility their work could be used to undermine people’s willingness to get vaccinated or to vaccinate their children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Absolutely. We know it gets weaponized and it’s very, very hard to fight that,” said Belongia, who is a senior research scientist doing vaccine research and infectious disease epidemiology at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Science is at a disadvantage against them because they can take little bits of information and distort it, twist it, oversimplify it, and for the general public that doesn’t really know much about science or how this works, it sounds concerning,” he said. “[But] there are all sorts of reasons why what we’re seeing … might not be real.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alison Buttenheim, a professor of nursing at the University of Pennsylvania who studies vaccine acceptance and hesitancy, said it’s critically important that vaccine researchers follow the leads that emerge, regardless of whether the outcome exonerates or implicates a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She finds it reassuring to know this work is being done. But Buttenheim noted that science literacy among Americans is generally not high, and people don’t understand that science is an iterative process. “We live in a world where people are really uncomfortable with the idea that science evolves,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The increased tendency to release papers as preprints, before they’ve been vetted, is adding to the public relations challenges for vaccine safety research, said Belongia, though he noted that getting information out quickly, so that other researchers could build off new findings, was of critical importance during the Covid pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Iwasaki said the group grappled with the question of whether to post the paper to medRxiv, or to wait for it to go through peer review. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think about this every day,” she said. “But we opted to share this data in preprint because first, the publication process usually takes a while, and patients are suffering every day. And we didn’t want to wait until something is published to share this information with the patients … because most of them have been completely ignored.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Krumholz concurred. “We did debate it a lot,” he said. “In the end, the information about it was getting out by the grapevine and we thought better to preprint it as it was going through peer review. And we have had experience with journals not wanting to publish information about vaccine adverse effects — and we do not know how long it might take to publish it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Belongia said there’s no easy answer to the question of what vaccine researchers who find themselves in such situations should do. The work must continue, and the public has a right to be kept abreast of signals and the ultimate findings — transparency is critical to maintaining the public’s faith in vaccines, he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, that transparency will be used against the field, Belongia admitted. “I don’t know the solution in terms of how to deal with this and maintain public trust in an environment where any sort of measured voice that reflects the uncertainty of what we’re looking at is drowned out by the chorus of misinformation and disinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But with vapes, you just keep going and it's much harder to know how many puffs you've had. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's much easier to vape continuously because you can do it in places where smoking might be less acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What we have found is the dangers for someone who keeps vaping are no different from smokers.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-7d2499e0-cd16-11ef-b756-1d55513ec566"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; chiefs insisting it is safer than smoking, experts have long said vaping is not risk-free. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;E-cigarettes contain harmful toxins and their long-term effects remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have expressed fears there could be a wave of lung disease, dental issues and even &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-8ef7edb0-2812-11ef-8888-cd6a079abb92" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the coming decades in people who took up the habit at a young age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, researchers tracked volunteers, aged 27 on average all of whom had a similar level of fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were given regular stress tests to measure the elasticity of their blood vessels and the speed of blood flow to their brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Campaigners have long blamed predatory manufacturers for the ever-growing crisis, claiming they are intentionally luring kids in with colourful packaging, compared to highlighter pens, and child-friendly flavours such as bubblegum and cotton candy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For 12 hours prior to each test, they consumed only water and desisted from vaping, smoking and exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Boidin, the mediated dilation (FMD) test — where in which a cuff is placed on the participant's arm to measure how much the artery expands as more blood is passed through it — produced the starkest results on vaping's effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both smokers and vapers achieved a flat reading, signalling they had damaged artery walls that can no longer dilate - an almost certain sign of future serious cardiovascular problems, Dr Boidin added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further tests proved that the blood flow in smokers and vapers is similarly impaired, making them at risk of developing cognitive dysfunction, including dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'When you put this mixture of metals and chemicals into your body you can't expect nothing to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'The only benefit of vaping is to help people quit smoking, but if they keep vaping the result is going to be the same. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I think doctors should be able to prescribe vapes for a certain time, so they could be used as a transition tool, but only for a short time.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13267453/health-complications-linked-vaping.html"&gt;MailOnline also discovered&lt;/a&gt; the number of adverse side effects linked to vaping reported to UK regulators has now eclipsed 1,000, with five of them fatal.&lt;/p&gt;

around a fifth of people globally at some point in their lives&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planned Parenthood provides a wide range of reproductive healthcare-related &lt;a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/get-care/our-services" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;services&lt;/a&gt;, from sex education and prenatal care to infertility services, and treatment for STDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/other/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; services include vaccinations, &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/tumor-operation-on-hold-covid-patients-taking-all-hospital-beds/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; screenings, birth control, &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/topics/mental-health" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; services, postpartum services, as well as wellness and preventative care, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protests outside of Planned Parenthood aren’t anything new. Not every American agrees with the services provided at these clinics. However, for millions of other people, these clinics provide essential care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case in point, the author of the viral post was able to get tested for ovarian cancer at Planned Parenthood while she was “between insurances.” Luckily, her tests came back negative. At the time of writing, the woman’s post had been upvoted 20k times and had garnered over 360 comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer is pervasive &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/topics/around-the-world" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;around the world&lt;/a&gt;. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2022, there were 20 million new cancer cases and 9.7 million cancer-related deaths globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/01-02-2024-global-cancer-burden-growing--amidst-mounting-need-for-services" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that around a fifth of people develop cancer in their lifetime. Meanwhile, 1 in 12 women and 1 in 9 men die from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most commonly occurring cancers include: lung cancer (12.4% of all new cases), female &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/topics/breast-cancer" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; (11.6%), colorectal cancer (9.6%), prostate cancer (7.3%), and stomach cancer (4.9%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Keep an eye out for changes in your body and health and don’t be scared of reaching out to a medical professional for some tests&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/data/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/dcpc/data/index.htm" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that in the &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/topics/united-states" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 1.78 million new cancer cases were reported. In 2022, over 608k Americans lost their lives due to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, the sooner you know that you may have cancer, the better your chances of treatment and survival. That’s why it’s so important to get regular screenings and to get in touch with your doctor if you have worrying symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ovarian-cancer/symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;warns&lt;/a&gt; that ovarian cancer may cause the following signs and symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vaginal bleeding (particularly if you are past menopause), or discharge from your v****a that is not normal for you;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain or pressure in the pelvic area;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Abdominal or back pain;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bloating;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling full too quickly, or having difficulty eating;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A change in your bathroom habits, such as a more frequent or urgent need to urinate and/or constipation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have unusual bleeding, see a doctor immediately. Meanwhile, if you have any of the other signs for 2+ weeks, go see your doctor. These signs may not mean that you necessarily have cancer, you may have other health problems, but you won’t know until you get tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had a &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/husband-leaves-lunch-wifes-tumor-surgery-goes-wrong/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;cancer scare&lt;/a&gt;, dear Pandas?

"Going to bed early and getting high-quality sleep is a game changer for energy levels, focus, motivation, and overall feeling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and her husband, Warren Lentz, wind down for the night by watching TV and cuddling. They go to bed at 8:30 p.m. most nights.&lt;/p&gt;

In a 2024 study published in the Journal of Biophotonics, researchers found that red light appeared to improve the performance of mitochondria in the body — but there's no proof this leads to overall better energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barnes-Lentz has also &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C3lxFZqp_78/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on Instagram about how she uses red light therapy to reduce skin aging and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has shown some potential for improving the appearance of skin, such as reducing scars, acne, and wrinkles, but more research is needed to guarantee that it's effective, according to the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people buy $150,000 &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-execs-buying-red-light-therapy-beds-hyperbaric-chambers-wellness-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;red light therapy beds&lt;/a&gt; or do red light therapy treatments at spas or medical centers.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your daily magnesium needs depend on factors like your age and gender. Adult males need 400-420 milligrams of magnesium per day, and adult females require 310-400 milligrams per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nearly half of the United States population falls short of their daily magnesium intake needs, which can increase their risk of conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/heart-disease-causes-7094403" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Eating more magnesium-rich foods, like fruit, can help boost magnesium intake.

			&lt;p&gt;In an exceptionally rare case, a patient with a high genetic risk of developing  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="152583" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; appears to have avoided his probable fate for decades, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man's situation is only &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exceptional-genetic-twist-might-have-saved-a-colombian-woman-fated-to-develop-alzheimer-s"&gt;the third case&lt;/a&gt; like this on record, and the only one for the &lt;em&gt;PSEN2 &lt;/em&gt;mutation – the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-rare-gene-variant-seems-to-protect-you-from-alzheimers-disease"&gt;other two cases&lt;/a&gt; were for a different kind of genetic Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does this defy what we know about the mutation, which, for those who have it, almost always drives the development of Alzheimer's at around age 50  – his brain was &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00398-4?linkId=12946067"&gt;full of amyloid-beta plaques&lt;/a&gt;, the sticky protein clumps associated with Alzheimer's neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers has been keeping track of the disease in his family since 2011, as part of a project to better understand dominantly inherited Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zTd0-A5yDZI?start=65&amp;amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His mother had the &lt;em&gt;PSEN2 &lt;/em&gt;mutation, which is believed to drive early Alzheimer's by accelerating amyloid clumping, though it's still unclear exactly how that works. Eleven of her 13 siblings also had this gene mutation. And all were diagnosed with Alzheimer's by roughly age 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did this man dodge the family curse? Scientists studied the man's case, in the hope that his unique history could uncover a more universal mechanism behind the disease, which still evades us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both genetic and non-genetic forms of Alzheimer's, amyloid deposits build up slowly in the brain until levels reach a critical point. Along with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-witness-the-tipping-point-of-alzheimers-in-the-lab-for-the-first-time"&gt;tangles of another protein&lt;/a&gt; called tau, this &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-may-finally-understand-how-the-tangled-proteins-in-dementia-cause-cells-to-die"&gt;directly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-shows-how-alzheimer-s-causes-cells-to-overheat-and-fry-like-eggs"&gt;indirectly&lt;/a&gt; leads to neuron death and, ultimately, cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across ten years of study – led by population geneticist Maria Victoria Fernandez, from the International University of Catalonia, and neuroscientists Jorge Llibre-Guerra and Nelly Joseph-Mathurin, both from Washington University in St Louis – the man's memory and cognitive tests all remained normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic tests ruled out the protective mutations that had been found in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-rare-gene-variant-seems-to-protect-you-from-alzheimers-disease"&gt;two other patients&lt;/a&gt; who had resisted Alzheimer's against their genetic odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although his brain was riddled with amyloid by age 61, as they would expect from someone with the &lt;em&gt;PSEN2&lt;/em&gt; mutation, it showed drastically less inflammation than Alzheimer's patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What tau proteins they detected were confined to the occipital lobe (at the back of our head, associated with vision), "potentially explaining the preservation of cognitive functions," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03494-0"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. For someone with Alzheimer's, tau would usually be far more widespread, and it didn't even appear to impact his visual or spatial scores in tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This pattern of restricted tau deposition is similar to previously reported extreme resilience cases," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03494-0"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt;. "This containment of tau pathology, a common feature across currently known extremely resilient individuals, might be a critical factor in delaying the onset of Alzheimer's symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, with a one-man sample size, it's impossible to tease apart exactly which aspects are truly involved. But the case study does open some interesting lines of inquiry, the most major being that, despite &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/worlds-leading-theory-on-alzheimers-in-crisis-after-major-drug-trials-fail"&gt;prevailing theories&lt;/a&gt;, an abundance of amyloid did not seem to confer Alzheimer's on this particular man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors suspect that in cases like this, where tau deposits are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/woman-who-defied-alzheimers-could-show-us-how-to-avoid-it"&gt;prevented from spreading&lt;/a&gt;, the cascade that leads to typical Alzheimer's symptoms may be interrupted, or significantly slowed, regardless of amyloid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did have nine genetic variants that were absent among his &lt;em&gt;PSEN2-&lt;/em&gt;affected family members. Six of these haven't been linked to Alzheimer's before, but they do have a hand in brain inflammation and protein folding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team thinks an unlikely combo, of these genes, and the man's years of exposure to high heat while working as a mechanic in a diesel engine navy ship, may have steered him clear of the regular &lt;em&gt;PSEN2 &lt;/em&gt;path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Chronic exposure to such stress could activate cellular pathways involved in heat shock response and protein folding, which have been implicated in cellular resilience in neurodegenerative diseases," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03494-0"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Understanding the mechanisms that restrict tau spread in this individual could provide crucial insights into potential therapeutic targets for preventing or slowing the progression of AD."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03494-0"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

– there are five lesser-known signs of dementia that we should all be aware of too, if not for ourselves then for our family members. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the five unexpected signs of dementia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first one is&lt;strong&gt; financial problems&lt;/strong&gt;, said Dr Chen. “One of the early signs of dementia can be difficulty managing money,” &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@doctor.bing/video/7424654917555637550" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="he explained in a TikTok video." data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b635e5e4b050f805a0be71" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.tiktok.com/@doctor.bing/video/7424654917555637550" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;he explained in a TikTok video.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could look like missing payments, struggling with simple budgeting or making financial decisions that just seem out of character like giving away large amounts of money or falling for scams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another sign is &lt;strong&gt;struggling with a sleep disorder. &lt;/strong&gt;The expert said that as people age, they tend to sleep lightly, and go to bed and wake up earlier than they used to – and that’s normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However if there are dramatic changes in someone’s sleep habits, where they are starting their morning at say 2am or unable to stay awake during the day, it can be a sign of dementia,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third sign the neurologist flagged is &lt;strong&gt;personality changes&lt;/strong&gt; – as dementia can impact a person’s mood or personality “and someone who was once calm might become easily agitated or even aggressive”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with early dementia might also find themselves getting lost on roads they drive down all the time, or even running through red lights and missing exits on the motorway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We all have lapses in attention and miss an exit once in a while ... but if these &lt;strong&gt;driving problems&lt;/strong&gt; become a consistent pattern, it’s time to take it seriously,” said Dr Chen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And lastly, &lt;strong&gt;loss of smell&lt;/strong&gt; could flag changes in your brain. “This might surprise you but &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/sense-smell-linked-speed-brain-loss-and-cognitive-decline" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="losing the ability to smell could be one of the first signs of dementia" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b635e5e4b050f805a0be71" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/sense-smell-linked-speed-brain-loss-and-cognitive-decline" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;losing the ability to smell could be one of the first signs of dementia&lt;/a&gt;,” said the neurologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people that eventually go on to develop dementia begin to lose their sense of smell years or even decades before other symptoms appear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re worried you might have dementia, start by talking to your GP, who can carry out an initial assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/symptoms-and-diagnosis/dementia-diagnosis/how-to-get-dementia-diagnosis" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="According to Alzheimer’s Society," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b635e5e4b050f805a0be71" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/symptoms-and-diagnosis/dementia-diagnosis/how-to-get-dementia-diagnosis" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;According to Alzheimer’s Society,&lt;/a&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-new-drug-could-halt-the-growth-of-aggressive-breast-cancer"&gt;Breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; cases in the US among women aged under 40 are jumping up by nearly half a percent each year, though new research by scientists at Columbia University suggests the rise isn't spread evenly across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding why breast  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="153013" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; diagnoses are rising more steeply in some parts of the country than others could identify who is at greater risk, and possibly reveal ways to reduce the disease's incidence overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/OP.20.00793"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; had identified a growth in invasive breast cancer cases among women across the US of 0.56 percent each year on average. Among those under the age of 40, the rise is even more alarming, jumping each year by more than 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new analysis of &lt;span&gt;public health data from all 50 states gathered between 2001 and 2020 suggests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; breast cancer cases have remained stable or even dropped in some states, providing experts with useful regional reference points for working out the underlying causes of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/OP.20.00793"&gt;these worrying patterns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153016" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153016" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/CancerChart.jpg" alt="Breast cancer graph" class="wp-image-153016 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/CancerChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/CancerChart-634x415.jpg 634w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/CancerChart-600x393.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153016" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers wanted to get a better understanding of variations in the incidence of breast cancer in young women across different states. (Kehm et al., &lt;em&gt;Cancer Causes &amp;amp; Control&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Breast cancer incidence is increasing in US women under 40, but until now, it was unknown if incidence trends varied by US geographic region," &lt;a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/news/data-all-50-states-shows-early-onset-breast-cancer-rise-younger-women"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; lead author and epidemiologist Rebecca Kehm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings can more accurately inform whether exposures that vary in prevalence across the US also contribute to breast cancer risk in younger women."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we know, for example, that incidence rates &lt;span&gt;over the two decades studied &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;have been highest in Maryland, New York, New Jersey, Hawaii, and Connecticut,  and that the south was the only region where there was no increase in rates overall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also offers some clarity over which groups of women at at the greatest risk of the disease. Across all regions, non-Hispanic Black women had the highest incidence of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16805-breast-cancer-in-young-women"&gt;early-onset breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, while non-Hispanic white women was the only group to show a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/p-value" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73101" data-postid="153013" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;statistically significant&lt;/a&gt; rise in rates in every part of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not clear why these particular groups might experience higher numbers of diagnoses, but multiple factors are likely to be involved. We know, for example, that breast cancer risk is linked to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-linked-to-lower-risk-of-lung-and-breast-cancer-in-women"&gt;exercise levels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/all-hormonal-contraceptives-raise-breast-cancer-risk-slightly-study-finds"&gt;hormonal contraceptives&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/72-new-breast-cancer-genes-mutation-variants-record-sized-study"&gt;genetic variations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The increase in incidence we are seeing is alarming and cannot be explained by genetic factors alone, which evolve over much longer periods, nor by changes in screening practices given that women under 40 years are below the recommended age for routine mammography screening," &lt;a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/news/data-all-50-states-shows-early-onset-breast-cancer-rise-younger-women"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Kehm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer in young people is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer-in-under-50s-has-jumped-80-in-30-years-according-to-a-new-global-study"&gt;becoming more prevalent&lt;/a&gt; across all cancer types, with the number of deaths &lt;a href="https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000049"&gt;also rising&lt;/a&gt;: globally, cancer cases in 14 to 49-year-olds rose from 1.82 million in 1990 to 3.26 million in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the trend is to be reversed, researchers need to distinguish which regions are at higher risk, making screenings, prevention, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-3-strategies-can-improve-outcomes-for-cancer-patients"&gt;and treatment&lt;/a&gt; more personalized for each individual demographics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While the causes behind the rising incidence of early onset breast cancer are not yet fully understood, studying how trends vary across different population subgroups can offer valuable insights and help generate hypotheses for future research," &lt;a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/news/data-all-50-states-shows-early-onset-breast-cancer-rise-younger-women"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Mary Beth Terry.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A study published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that people can transmit bird  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="153028" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; to their domestic cats, with fatal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two household case studies from Michigan in May 2024 were published in the agency's &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7405a2.htm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as fears grow that the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="153028" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; could mutate and cause a human  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="153028" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, it has also emerged that cats can be infected by pet food contaminated with the virus – and it can spread between "big cat" species in shelters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both case studies involved pet owners who worked at or near dairy cattle farms affected by bird flu, and both resulted in deaths of infected felines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first case, a five-year-old indoor female cat rapidly developed a loss of appetite, poor grooming habits, disorientation, lethargy, and neurological deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her condition worsened quickly, requiring emergency care at the Michigan State University (MSU) Veterinary Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite intervention, her symptoms progressed, and she was euthanized within four days. Postmortem testing confirmed she had contracted bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other cats lived in the same household. One exhibited mild symptoms, which the owners attributed to allergies, and they ceased communication with public health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the household members, the farm worker declined testing, while an adult and two adolescents tested negative for bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141087" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141087" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/CatHuggingHumanFaceOutdoorsR_U_642.jpg" alt="Human and cat hugging" class="size-full wp-image-141087" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/CatHuggingHumanFaceOutdoorsR_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/CatHuggingHumanFaceOutdoorsR_U_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/CatHuggingHumanFaceOutdoorsR_U_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141087" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The CDC study suggests people can transmit bird flu to their domestic cats.(&lt;a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/portrait-young-woman-cat-naturally-3303470/"&gt;Uschi_Du/Pixabay&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Unpasteurized milk connection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days later, a second case involving a six-month-old male Maine Coon was brought to the university. The cat exhibited symptoms including anorexia, lethargy, facial swelling, and limited movement, and died within 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cat lived with another feline that remained unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maine Coon's owner regularly transported unpasteurized milk from various Michigan farms, including those confirmed to have infected dairy cattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner reported handling raw milk without protective gear, frequently getting splashed in the face, eyes, and clothing, and failing to change work clothes before entering the home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, the sick cat frequently rolled in the owner's contaminated work clothes, whereas the unaffected cat did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner also experienced eye irritation before the cat fell ill but declined testing for bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_148480" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-148480" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/bird_flu_rods_header-642x260.jpg" alt="micrographs of bird flu viruses" class="size-medium wp-image-148480" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/bird_flu_rods_header-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/bird_flu_rods_header-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/bird_flu_rods_header-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/bird_flu_rods_header.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-148480" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="ccfic-text"&gt;H5N1/bird flu virus particles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ccfic-source"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/nih-releases-h5n1-influenza-research-agenda" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;(CDC/NIAID)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Farmworkers are encouraged to consider removing clothing and footwear and to rinse off any animal byproduct residue (including milk and feces) before entering households," the CDC researchers &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7405a2.htm"&gt;advised&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the US outbreak began in 2024, 69 human cases of bird flu have been officially reported in the US, though the true number may be significantly higher due to limited testing among farm workers. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/us-records-its-first-death-from-bird-flu-in-tragic-end-to-louisiana-case"&gt;One person has died&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts warn that as the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cdc-report-suggests-bird-flu-is-spreading-undetected-to-humans"&gt;virus continues to circulate&lt;/a&gt; widely among mammals and birds, it could eventually mix with seasonal  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="153028" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt;, potentially mutating into a strain capable of efficient human-to-human transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newly confirmed US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said he wants the government to pivot away from infectious disease research and cast doubt on whether germs actually cause illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has also for decades questioned the use of vaccines – seen as key to containing bird flu if it does become a pandemic – and has promoted the consumption of raw milk, a known vector for bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;© &lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If you think you may have been exposed or are showing symptoms, please contact your healthcare provider immediately,” said Dr. Anita Kurian, Deputy Deputy Director at the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles was declared eradicated in the United States in 2000. This was achieved through a successful vaccination program that ensured high levels of immunity in the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individuals who have not been vaccinated are at greater risk of infection. We urge everyone to ensure they are up to date on their vaccinations to protect themselves and those around them,” Dr. Kurian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Protecting our community from measles starts with staying informed and taking the necessary precautions," she said. "We encourage everyone to review their vaccination status and seek medical advice if they suspect exposure. Early detection and vaccination are key to preventing the spread of this preventable disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Health recommend those who may have been exposed take the following steps:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review their immunization and medical records to check if they are protected against measles. Those who have not had measles, or the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine may not be protected and should consult a healthcare provider about getting vaccinated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact their healthcare provider if they are pregnant, have an infant, or have a weakened immune system, regardless of their vaccination history.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor for symptoms such as fever or an unexplained rash from 4 to 21 days after exposure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If symptoms appear, stay home, and avoid school, work, and large gatherings. Call a healthcare provider right away. Do not enter a healthcare facility without first notifying them about your measles exposure and symptoms so you do not expose other patients. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

            &lt;p class="PromoA-description"&gt;Dr. Peter Hotez says the ecosystem that led to the elimination of measles in the United States in 2000 has changed as vaccination rates fall, and there will likely be more breakthrough outbreaks of all vaccine-preventable infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Measles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles spreads easily through the air when an infected person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. The virus can stay in the air and on surfaces for two hours, even after the infected person has left. The infected person can spread the disease up to four days before a measles rash appears and up to four days after the rash appears. If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses or mouths, they can become infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Common symptoms for measles include:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (as high as 105°F)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red and watery eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny white spots that may appear inside the mouth 2-3 days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash 3-5 days after other signs of illness. The “measles rash” typically starts at the face and then spreads down to the rest of the body&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can be prevented with a measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR or MMRV). The MMR vaccine protects against three diseases: measles, mumps and rubella. The MMRV vaccine protects against four diseases: measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (chickenpox). They are administered in two doses and are highly effective: two doses are 97% effective against measles and one dose is 93% effective. The spread of measles can be prevented if two-dose coverage of vaccine remains at 95% or above in the community.

New research suggests that just five minutes a day of light, low-dose exercise might help reduce the risk of dementia.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that for every additional 30 minutes of weekly moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), there was a 4% reduction in dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the most "striking" finding came when comparing people who engaged in no physical activity at all to those who managed to get even minimal amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that even frail or nearly frail older adults might be able to reduce their dementia risk through low-dose exercise," said Wanigatunga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that the study was not a clinical trial that established causation indicating that exercise reduces &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/dementia-risk-people-55-older-has-doubled-new-study-finds" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dementia risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;, but that its findings are consistent with that hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To check the possibility that their findings reflected undiagnosed dementia leading to lower physical activity," News Medical reported, "the researchers repeated their analysis but excluded dementia diagnoses in the first two years of follow-up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The association between more activity and lower dementia risk remained robust."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Health and Fox News' senior medical analyst, was not involved in the study but shared his reaction to the "important" findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is not proof, just an association, but is very useful for the group that gets discouraged, thinking, ‘I can’t do a lot of exercise because of illness or disability, so why do any?’ This study suggests that even small amounts are helpful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The beneficial effects could also be tied to healthier lifestyle decisions, a doctor said about the new study's findings.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many mechanisms that could explain this effect, Siegel said – "primarily increased blood flow to the brain, as well as improved disposal of metabolic waste and decreased inflammation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, "It is also likely associated with healthier lifestyle decisions that also decrease the advent of neuroinflammation, dysregulation and plaque formation that characterize dementia, especially Alzheimer’s."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/sleep-disorders" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:include sleep,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;include sleep,&lt;/a&gt;

Many are losing up to 22.5 per cent of their weight in the first 18 months. The NHS is preparing to provide Mounjaro for severely obese patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Wegovy — a higher-dose formulation of Ozempic, originally developed to treat diabetes — was introduced on the NHS in September last year. However, access is limited to specialist weight-loss clinics in select areas of England. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;About 4.1 million people meet the NHS criteria for Wegovy, which requires a body mass index over 35 and associated health conditions. The private market sets a lower threshold of 30, making the injections available to about 15 million adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The MHRA figures show that 18 deaths were explicitly linked to Mounjaro, while 29 occurred following the use of Ozempic, Rybelsus, or Wegovy, all of which contain the active ingredient semaglutide. Another 35 fatalities were associated with Saxenda and Victoza, which contain liraglutide, The Sun reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Susan McGowan, 58, a Scottish nurse, &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/death-of-scottish-nurse-is-first-linked-to-weight-loss-drug-wbg92z2xc" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;died last year&lt;/a&gt; after taking two low-dose injections of Mounjaro over a fortnight.

The idea? Rewarding methamphetamine users who get clean with gift cards to Burger King, Walmart and other stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug treatment providers in four Bay Area counties have tried the approach since the first local program started in San Jose a year ago as part of a statewide pilot. About 300 users of meth and other stimulants have participated so far and received a combined $23,500 for passing regularly scheduled drug tests. Hundreds more in the region are expected to give it a shot this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works: Participants earn gift card money each time they pass a drug test on a set schedule, once or twice a week. They can stop at any time — but that also means they stop earning rewards.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

About 50 people have enrolled so far, Saver said.

(Dai Sugano/Bay Area News Group) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like much of the U.S., California has a meth problem. About 5,170 people fatally overdosed on meth or another stimulant in California during a 12-month period ending in October 2024, narrowly trailing the death rate of fentanyl and other opioids. It’s also very common for people to use opioids and meth at the same time and die from a combination of the two. &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/12/15/drug-overdose-california-decline-pandemic/"&gt;Overdose rates have recently fallen in the Bay Area.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to fentanyl users, though, meth users have fewer treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medications such as buprenorphine are extremely effective at reducing opioid overdose risk and smothering cravings. Currently, &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/02/06/the-gold-standard-of-drug-treatment-saves-lives-california-is-pushing-for-more-access-in-jails/"&gt;California public health experts are trying to improve access&lt;/a&gt; in hospitals, prisons and jails. But no such medication exists for people addicted to meth or cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Krawetz was one of the first people in the Bay Area to try the new gift card program. Last year, staff asked him if he wanted to enroll while living at Our Common Ground’s supportive housing facility in Redwood City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krawetz, 51, entered recovery from meth and other drugs more than a year ago, he said. The gift card program was a piece of that success. He completed all 24 weeks and earned the maximum payout, which he used to buy his nieces Halloween costumes from Walmart and then birthday gifts from Marshalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California became the first state in the U.S. to gain approval from the federal government to pay for the treatment strategy with Medicaid funds. That federal approval lasts through 2026. The state Department of Health Care Services pays for the gift cards and sets strict standards for the programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I want to stay sober,” Krawetz said. “This not only reinforces that but gives me incentive to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He plans to find a sober residence to call home and continue making pottery at a local studio. It’s impressive progress from just a few years ago when he went from living in a lean-to in a San Jose park to jail. He was beyond help, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m bipolar, and I’m an addict,” Krawetz said. “And when I use drugs, I go homeless. I’m just crazy. I’m not normally like that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Morales, operations director at Our Common Ground, said participants are broadly enjoying the program, and it’s a cost-effective way to supplement other conventional treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Untreated meth addictions routinely land users in expensive emergency rooms or jails. In Santa Clara County, where Krawetz was incarcerated for five months, &lt;a href="https://www.vera.org/publications/what-jails-cost-cities/san-jose-ca"&gt;it costs more than $106,000 to jail someone for a year.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are far more tax dollars spent on someone actively in addiction,” Morales said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But because relapse is “more the rule than the exception,” and meth users tend to lead unstable lives, Morales said that success in the gift card program doesn’t necessarily mean that someone completes the 24 weeks of drug testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If it works for some, it’s a good thing,” he said. “The more tools, the merrier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hard measure of success, though, is the number of urine tests that come back clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In San Jose, HealthRight 360 staff have conducted 740 drug tests on program participants since February 2024. Of those, 94% showed negative results for meth or other stimulants, according to Saver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That figure is even higher, 96%, in Alameda County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug treatment providers in 20 other California counties have rolled out gift card programs in the last two years, including in Contra Costa County and San Francisco, as part of a pilot program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statewide, about 4,260 stimulant users receiving Medi-Cal benefits enrolled in a gift card program in 2024, according to the state Department of Health Care Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the data looked so promising that it made him suspicious, said Thomas Freese, a clinical psychologist and director of integrated substance abuse programs at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Is it really as positive as it seems?” he said. “And it seems that it is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Bay Area, it’s too soon to say if the gift cards will help meth users stay in recovery for long. In 2021, a scientific meta-analysis of the treatment by researchers found that it’s effective for at least a year.&lt;/p&gt;

(KATU) — &lt;/span&gt;Colorectal cancer diagnoses and deaths are increasing among younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report from the American Cancer Society indicated that one in five people diagnosed are under the age of 55. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As March marks Colon Cancer Awareness Month, physicians at Kaiser Permanente Northwest emphasize the importance of regular screenings to detect colon cancer early and save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in the United States and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men under 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This concerning trend prompted the &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/american-cancer-society-releases-new-colorectal-cancer-statistics-rapid-shifts-to-more-advanced-disease-and-younger-people-301759641.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/american-cancer-society-releases-new-colorectal-cancer-statistics-rapid-shifts-to-more-advanced-disease-and-younger-people-301759641.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; to lower the recommended age for colorectal screening to 45 in 2018. Regular screening is considered a crucial tool for early detection or prevention of colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Colon cancer can happen to anyone at any age," said Dr. David Parsons, a colon and rectal surgeon with Kaiser Permanente Northwest. "There can be no symptoms with colorectal cancer, so it's not advisable to wait until symptoms like changes in stool, abdominal pain, or bleeding present themselves. Early detection is important. Colon cancer is preventable and treatable with proper screenings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer symptoms often do not appear until the disease is advanced, making it more challenging to treat. A fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is highlighted as an effective and convenient screening option that can be conducted at home, aiding in early detection when the cancer is more treatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ ALSO:&lt;a href="https://katu.com/news/local/health-care-professionals-warn-trump-medical-research-cuts-could-impact-lifesaving-efforts#" target="_blank" title="https://katu.com/news/local/health-care-professionals-warn-trump-medical-research-cuts-could-impact-lifesaving-efforts#" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt; Health care professionals warn Trump medical research cuts could impact lifesaving efforts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Cancer Society reported that in 2023, 20% of colon cancer diagnoses were in patients under 55, nearly double the rate in 1995. While the exact cause of the rise in young adults is unknown, factors such as obesity, smoking, heavy alcohol use, and diets high in red meats and processed meats have been associated with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed meats include bacon, sausage, lunch/deli meats and hot dogs. Red meat is defined as beef, pork and lamb. Research from &lt;a href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/center-news/2024/04/colorectal-cancer-risk-boosted-by-red-processed-meat-genetics.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/center-news/2024/04/colorectal-cancer-risk-boosted-by-red-processed-meat-genetics.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Fred Hutch &lt;/a&gt;Cancer Center genetic and molecular epidemiologist, Dr. Rikki Peters, showed that although eating red meat can increase the risk for colorectal cancer by 30%, and processed meat by 40%, she said she knows that  genetic background may play a role,  as "we know that not everyone who eats bacon almost every day will develop colorectal cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the increasing rates among younger individuals, the overall death rate from colorectal cancer has been declining for several decades. This decline is attributed to the increased detection and removal of colorectal polyps through screening, preventing them from developing into cancers. Additionally, many colorectal cancers are now being found earlier, making them easier to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, incidence rates in people under 50 have been rising by 1% to 2% annually since the mid-1990s. A 2022 study published in the journal&lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article-abstract/31/9/1701/708746/Persistent-Disparities-in-Colorectal-Cancer?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" title="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article-abstract/31/9/1701/708746/Persistent-Disparities-in-Colorectal-Cancer?redirectedFrom=fulltext" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt; Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; noted that a younger generation of Americans is being diagnosed with advanced stages of colorectal, rectal, and colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distribution of colorectal cancer is uneven across U.S. subpopulations, with significant differences in incidence, cancer stage, and mortality by race and ethnicity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Black Americans, Native Americans have the second highest colorectal cancer incidence rate at 39.3 per 100,000 people. Asian and Pacific Islanders have an incidence rate of 31.7 per 100,000 people, and Hispanic people have an incidence rate of 33.5 per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KATU</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 22:33:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQQXhSRks2U25XNEc1Q2hBNkREaTJCSk9xbTJ0dnpXTkxWYnp6UmxoX2taY1ZhR01kSUV4NlBPV1V2cW5UZ3dYV18wanNVMFcxUkdOQTFxYS1QNGlpRXdDa3VXUm9pdzZ4M0VzcjVZRkQ2N1U2OWFfbHNnU3hyNEVnNF9hbExybzNuTkV0UnRXQ1hXNEUtOWdMMkQwWms5SmlLWE9rbE43TTAxZw</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Confirm Your Pupils Change Size When You Breathe - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxNYVlmNWNZWC1aQ2RfVjdoa3Q4b1JYWGhFcGQ5bXBTdE42eVV1SU1Xc0lNNDEwZ25xUjRrYnBBZjduZDRNRDVyTlhkc0dMUWgyNXlUNVhSdHZEcHBTdGV2U1hvajl1UGZPLW14NmpXWDc1c3h5SEdaZTBZXzNrVWdfSXJLTkh2akdiclg2MDVPUllEdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;You have probably heard the saying that the eyes are the windows to the soul, but now it turns out that they are also connected to how we breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long studied the size of our pupils to understand attention, emotion and even medical conditions. But now, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1113/JP287205"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; has surprisingly revealed that they change size in sync with our breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our pupils are never static; they constantly adjust in response to both external and internal factors. The most well known is that they control how much light enters the eye, just like a camera aperture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can easily test this yourself: look into a mirror and shine a light into your eye, and you'll see your pupils shrink. This process directly affects our visual perception. Larger pupils help us to detect faint objects, particularly in our peripheral vision, while smaller pupils enhance sharpness, improving tasks like reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153026" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153026" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/mans-eyes-closeup-642x260.jpg" alt="mans-eyes-closeup" class="wp-image-153026 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/mans-eyes-closeup-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/mans-eyes-closeup-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/mans-eyes-closeup-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/mans-eyes-closeup.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153026" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;If our pupils are constantly changing size, does that alter our perception? (&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/demietrich/9243814710"&gt;Dboybaker/Flickr, CC BY 2.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, this reflex is so reliable that doctors use it to assess brain function. If a pupil fails to react to light, it could signal a medical emergency such as a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is not just light that our pupils respond to. It's also well established that our pupils constrict when focusing on a nearby object, and dilate in response to cognitive effort or emotional arousal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the German pupil-research pioneer &lt;a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=225573"&gt;Irene Loewenfeld&lt;/a&gt; once said: "Man may either blush or turn pale when emotionally agitated, but his pupils always dilate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, pupil size is often used in psychology and neuroscience research as a measure of mental effort and attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The fourth response&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many decades, &lt;a href="https://journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.18"&gt;these three kinds of pupil response&lt;/a&gt; were the only ones that scientists were sure existed. Now, myself and our team of researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and the University of Groningen in the Netherlands have confirmed that breathing is a fourth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what will now be known as "pupillary respiratory phase response", pupils tend to be largest during exhalation and smallest around the start of inhalation. Unlike other pupil responses, this one originates exclusively in the body and of course happens constantly. Equally uniquely, it covers both dilation and constriction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There had in fact been anecdotal hints of a connection between breathing and our pupils for more than 50 years. But when the team reviewed past studies &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00424-022-02729-0"&gt;the evidence was inconclusive at best&lt;/a&gt;. Given how widely pupil size is used in both medicine and research, we realised it was crucial to investigate this further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We confirmed through a series of five experiments with more than 200 participants that pupil size fluctuates in sync with breathing, and also that this effect is remarkably robust. In these studies, we invited the participants to our lab and recorded their pupil size and breathing pattern while they were relaxing or performing tasks on a computer screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We systematically varied the other key pupil-response factors throughout the study – lighting, fixation distance and mental effort required for tasks. In all cases, the way that breathing affects the pupils remained constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we examined how different breathing patterns affected the response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were instructed to breathe solely through their nose or mouth and to adjust their breathing rate, as well as slowing it down and speeding it up. In all cases, the same pattern emerged: pupil size remained smallest around the onset of inhalation and largest during exhalation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What now&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery changes the way we think about both breathing and vision. It suggests a deeper connection between breathing and the nervous system than we previously realised. The next big question is whether these subtle changes in pupil size affect how we see the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fluctuations are only fractions of a millimetre, which is less than the pupil response to light, but similar to the pupil response to mental effort or arousal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of these fluctuations is theoretically large enough to influence our visual perception. It may therefore be that our vision subtly shifts within a single breath between optimising for detecting faint objects (with larger pupils) and distinguishing fine details (with smaller pupils).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, just as the pupillary light response is used as a diagnostic tool, changes in the link between pupil size and breathing could be an early sign of neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research is part of a broader effort to understand how our internal bodily rhythms influence perception. Scientists are increasingly finding that our brain doesn't process external information in isolation – it integrates signals from within our bodies, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01425-1"&gt;information from our heart and gastric rhythms&lt;/a&gt; have also been suggested to enhance or hinder the processing of incoming sensory stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If our breathing affects how our pupils change, could it also shape how we perceive the world around us? This opens the door to new research on how bodily rhythms shape perception – one breath at a time.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/250435/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Today it is happening again with GLP1 agonists like Semaglutide with the brand names of Wegovy, Ozempic, and Rybelsus and similar drugs like Moujaro and Zepbound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And just like all the other weight loss fads and trends, people gain the weight back after they stop taking the drug. One &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9542252/#:~:text=Conclusions,improvements%20in%20weight%20and%20health." target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that participants regained two-thirds of their weight one year after stopping the shots. The study concluded that patients needed to continue taking the drug indefinitely to keep the weight off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Whit Roberts, D.C. of &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?utm_source=shot6" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; says he is concerned about more than just the regained weight. He is concerned about the financial costs and health risks potentially posed by these drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The cost of these drugs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a heavy monetary cost of long-term drug treatment – potentially thousands of dollars every year. Then there are the health costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't yet know all the long-term side effects as this is a new trend among non-diabetic individuals," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK603723/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; some of the most common short-term effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, increased hunger, and diarrhea. Less common or potentially serious side effects include thyroid cancer, gallbladder disorders, kidney damage, fatigue, headache, rash, hair loss, anxiety and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Zerbor/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts, who has worked with obese patients for 30 years, described some of the lasting side effects he has seen among his patients. "I have seen side effects last long after patients discontinue the shots. These have included nausea, gastroparesis, bloating, fatigue, burping, stomach pain and weight gain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/you-quit-ozempic-or-wegovy-what-happens-next/#:~:text=After%20quitting%20GLP%2D1%20agonists,that%20sense%20of%20rebound%20hunger%E2%80%9D." target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;cites an article&lt;/a&gt; reporting one significant side effect to be an increase in visceral fat (dangerous fat around the organs). "Visceral fat is one of the most significant risk factors for heart disease, diabetes and fatty liver disease," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The best alternative&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The best alternative is identifying the underlying causes of stubborn weight and addressing them – not ignoring them. Weight gain is always a symptom or sign of chronic health problems. Drugs don't cure chronic illnesses. The body can, however, if given proper nutrition and therapeutic help," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Health Utah method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trained experts at &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?utm_source=shot6" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; take the time for a proper evaluation of your underlying issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No one-size-fits-all approach is going to work for everyone because differences exist between us," Roberts notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step at Health Utah is to gather information through a proprietary survey that will give preliminary evidence of health issues. This is followed by a body scan that reveals a tremendous amount of physiological data (you get a 17-page report) that Roberts can use in evaluating your case. Roberts will then conduct a thorough review of your health history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In speaking about the hour-long testing and evaluation at Health Utah, Roberts says, "People will likely learn more about their health in this one visit than they have in any other physical or consultation in the past."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A specialized health and weight loss program will be recommended.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no cutting calories, no counting calories, no cutting out whole categories of food like carbs and no crazy fads like eating all meat or all fat. You will eat foods that feed your organs and provide nutrients for healing and balancing," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your program may include therapies such as desensitization to foods or a form of hypnotherapy. You will leave this appointment with very valuable information you can implement immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your first step and special offer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, click on &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?utm_source=shot6" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; to schedule your survey, body scan, and consultation.

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"I started getting what I thought was a rash when I was around 15 years old. It never really went away, and it made my skin dry. It started to spread to other areas in big, red, dry patches. It didn’t itch, but it would hurt. I asked my GP about it a few times, and she looked at it and decided with only her eyes that it was eczema. I treated it as eczema for years and repeatedly asked about it for years. Finally, she had a roaming dermatologist check it out. I stood in the room totally naked, the dermatologist came in and without touching me, said, 'Yep, it’s eczema.' And left. I was so angry. I gave up!"&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"A few years later, my job transferred me to a new state, and I got new health insurance because of it. My new insurance allowed me to see who I wanted without a referral. My (now) husband has a friend who is a dermatologist, and we met up with her for a wedding. He asked her to check it out, and when I told her about it and showed it to her (profusely thanking her for doctoring off the clock), she told me to go get a punch biopsy. So with my new insurance, I saw a dermatologist who, on the SAME DAY, gave me a punch biopsy. I had my pathology results within a week and was told I have cutaneous T-cell lymphoma — a rare skin cancer!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, I was able to see a specialist quickly and get treatment. It’s not curable, but it will outlive me, so I’m just stuck with it for life, which I’m okay with now that I KNOW WHAT IT IS."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/katiei451664f73"&gt;katiei451664f73&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers discovered that children and teenagers with higher levels of generalized anxiety symptoms displayed a distinct pattern of brain activity when watching emotionally negative scenes from a movie. This pattern suggests that anxious youth may become more deeply engrossed in negative emotions when faced with upsetting situations. The findings were published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2827795" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generalized anxiety disorder is a common mental health condition, particularly among children and adolescents. It is characterized by excessive and persistent worry about various aspects of life, such as school, social situations, and future events. Experts have long known that generalized anxiety is linked to difficulties in processing emotions. Individuals with this condition often struggle to manage negative feelings and may be overly sensitive to negative cues in their environment. However, the precise brain mechanisms behind these emotional processing differences in anxious youth have remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies attempting to understand the brain basis of anxiety have often relied on simple, artificial stimuli, like static images of faces displaying different emotions. While these studies have provided some insights, they may not fully capture how people process emotions in real-world situations, which are typically more complex and dynamic. Our everyday experiences involve a constant stream of social and emotional information, often unfolding over time, such as when watching a movie or interacting with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this limitation, the researchers in the current study chose to use a more realistic approach by examining brain activity while young people watched a movie clip designed to evoke a range of emotions. By understanding how brain activity changes during this type of natural emotional processing, the researchers hoped to gain a more accurate picture of the brain differences associated with anxiety and potentially identify new avenues for developing more effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct their investigation, the researchers recruited a large group of 620 young people between the ages of 5 and 15. These participants were part of a larger ongoing research project studying brain development in youth facing challenges in school. All participants underwent brain scanning using a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI. This technology allows scientists to measure brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in the scanner, the young participants watched a ten-minute segment from the animated movie “Despicable Me.” This particular movie clip was chosen because it contains a mix of scenes designed to elicit different emotions, including both positive and negative feelings. The clip included scenes of a bedtime story, a tea party, moments where children are taken away by social services, humorous side stories, and a scene where the main character abandons the children to commit a crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the brain scans, the researchers also assessed the anxiety levels of the participants using a questionnaire called the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders. This questionnaire asks young people to report on their own anxiety symptoms. Using self-reports allowed the researchers to directly capture each child’s individual experience of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After collecting the brain scan data, the researchers used a sophisticated data analysis technique called hidden Markov modeling. This method is like searching for hidden patterns within complex data. In this case, it allowed the researchers to identify distinct “brain states” that occurred as the young people watched the movie. Think of these brain states as different modes of brain activity that the participants cycled through as the movie unfolded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also analyzed the movie clip itself, frame by frame, noting the emotional content, including how positive or negative the scenes were, as well as other visual and auditory features like brightness, motion, and loudness. This detailed analysis of the movie content allowed them to link specific brain states to particular types of scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed that the young people cycled through three primary brain states while watching the movie. The first state was characterized by high activity in brain regions associated with visual processing and movement, but lower activity in areas linked to attention and emotional processing. This state seemed to be associated with movie scenes that were brighter, louder, and less emotionally charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second brain state showed high activity in auditory and motor areas, but again, lower activity in emotion-related regions. This state appeared to be linked to scenes that were louder, less negative, contained more visual motion, and less focused on faces or bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third brain state was different. It showed high activity in brain regions involved in attention and emotional processing, but lower activity in visual and auditory areas. This state was more likely to occur during movie scenes that were emotionally negative, quieter, and had less visual motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the researchers found a significant link between generalized anxiety symptoms and brain state three. Young people who reported higher levels of generalized anxiety symptoms spent more time in this third brain state, particularly when watching emotionally negative parts of the movie. This suggests that when confronted with negative emotional content, anxious youth may be more inclined to engage a brain state associated with deeper emotional processing and attention to internal thoughts and feelings, potentially becoming more immersed in the negativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, these anxious youth also spent less time in brain state two during negative scenes. Furthermore, the researchers observed that young people with higher anxiety symptoms had more frequent shifts between brain state one (the state associated with less emotional processing) and brain state three (the state associated with higher emotional processing). This might indicate a greater reactivity to emotional changes in the movie for anxious youth. These patterns were specifically linked to generalized anxiety and were not found in relation to social anxiety symptoms, suggesting that these brain activity patterns are particularly relevant to the type of excessive worry that defines generalized anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, this research opens new directions for understanding and treating anxiety in young people. The finding that anxious youth tend to get “stuck” in a brain state associated with heightened emotional processing during negative situations suggests potential targets for interventions. For example, therapies aimed at helping anxious youth shift out of this state, perhaps by training them to redirect their attention or strengthen their ability to control their focus, could be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to identify these brain states in real-time could potentially lead to innovative interventions using techniques like brain stimulation to help young people regulate their emotional responses as they happen.

                  &lt;div class="commtext c00"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my field. There have been three major scandals in the "amyloid" field -- Sylvain Lesne, Eliezer Masliah, and lecanemab trials not informing patients they had the APOE4 variant, which is associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a vascular condition that the same scientists who led those trials previously noted was correlated with cerebral hemorrhage side effects. Sylvain Lesne produced shitty research that was not that highly cited, below is my take on the field and my concerns regarding journalists poorly communicating the science in this story. My perspective on why we are behind other fields is in paragraph five. The next three paragraphs are just context as to why I think there is no singular “amyloid hypothesis,” and why this kind of journalism threatens our field despite a desperate need for dealing with fraud, too. I realize this is long, I am not a journalist, I am not a good communicator, I am a scientist. If anyone has advice, please share it with me, likewise with questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not being clear about "amyloid" nomenclature threatens to throw the baby out with the bathwater, which will stall an Alzheimer's cure even more. Most proteins are "globular," think kind of round balls of scrunched up string, arranged in alpha-helices and some beta-sheets. "Amyloids" are spine-like fibrillar protein aggregates, where each vertebrate is a flattened version of a protein folded in beta-strands. The vertebrate is created by these beta-strands stacking into beta-sheets. Google "amyloid fiber" versus "globular protein" to see what I mean by this description.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Amyloid BETA" is a usually disordered protein which can aggregate into ONE of the amyloid fibrils seen in Alzheimer's and other dementia patients' brains. Tau can form amyloid fibers, so can TDP-43, TMEM, alpha-synuclein, etc. This is a good link -- &lt;a href="https://people.mbi.ucla.edu/sawaya/amyloidatlas/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://people.mbi.ucla.edu/sawaya/amyloidatlas/&lt;/a&gt; -- if you want to see the cross-sections of all of the amyloid fiber structures the field has solved with useful annotations.  One "amyloid hypothesis," for example, is that TAU hyperphosphorylation (the addition of a lot of very negatively charged post-translational modifications, think chemical ornaments you can add to a tree) leads to tau amyloid fibers, which then lead to amyloid-beta amyloid fibers. There is lots of speculation about the mechanism, whether amyloid fibers can also have enzymatic function that lead to metabolic dysregulation, whether certain amyloid fibers are actually functional and exist in everyone but that certain types or a certain amount is associated with disease, the catecholamine hypothesis is something that can’t be discounted, maybe amyloid fibers are just a downstream effect of a true ultimate cause (in which case, amyloid fibers are still an important clue, lots of people are doing experiments now where they see how they can get certain amyloid fibers in vitro using co-factors which may be one step back to the root cause).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another "amyloid hypothesis" is that amyloid beta OLIGOMERs, some kind of non-fibrillar aggregate that we don't know the structure of but that we know contains proteins that usually also make amyloid fibers , causes Alzheimer's. This is what "amyloid beta *56" is, by the way, an oligomer, and what Lesne’s work argued. We find oligomers to be extremely hard to work with and I could write a paragraph or two about why, but the fact that this is true makes OLIGOMER research, some of which is probably legitimate, an easy target for fraud. When molecules are well-known to be extremely difficult to work with, if you try to replicate someone's experiments and you can't, it could be because the molecules are extremely difficult to work with or because the authors whose experiments you tried to replicate committed fraud.  It’s easy to think “well, it must be me,” which is how people get away with it for so long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why are we so far behind? Something important to note is that amyloid fiber structure on an atomic level has only recently been cracked. Consider that we've known the structure of DNA since the 50s, but we didn't know the structure of the MOST common amyloid fiber specific to Alzheimer's patients until 20 freaking 16 -- &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28678775/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28678775/&lt;/a&gt;. The reason for this is that the method used to solve the structure of most proteins is x-ray crystallography, but nobody has ever successfully crystallized amyloid fibers except for very small fragments of them -- &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15944695/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15944695/&lt;/a&gt;. People think this makes physical sense for reasons related to crystal symmetry. The 2016 structure was solved using cryo-EM, which is a relatively recent development and only won the Nobel in 2017. Prior, it was derided as “blobology” because you would get very coarse structures from cryo-EM -- &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2726924/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2726924/&lt;/a&gt;. So, the field had to wait for cryo-EM to improve, a big part of which was waiting for better computer vision algorithms (i.e. we use YOLO and various CNN-based algorithms, too, we had to wait for that shit just like Waymo), among other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is structure so important? Drugs have to physically interact with some kind of protein target. So, you should probably know the atomic model of the target so you can make use of computational modeling techniques that can help you figure out what binds to proteins. Alternatively, if you want to do a ton of biochemical screens, i.e. make a bunch of the target protein, treat it with various compounds, and see what sticks, you have to make sure you are correctly making the target protein. In other words, you don’t know you’ve successfully reproduced the target if you don’t know what the target is. And the exact fiber structure matters, since different structures appear to be correlated with different diseases. Then, you have to figure out a method to make that protein, which people also have done recently for various types. The alternative is waiting for brains from brain banks, which is very slow and doesn’t provide a lot of material. Keep in mind this also means you can’t verify your mouse models have the same structures, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do not think these scandals significantly stalled an Alzheimer's cure. It's a genuinely tough field -- you can't do brain biopsies, amyloids are a tricky protein to work with, we didn’t know the structure until 9 years ago. I think there are a lot of people who feel like they were locked out of funding opportunities because of the focus on amyloid-beta. Maybe this is true, I don’t know. The lab I’m in has worked on tau for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another point -- neurodegeneration starts far before symptoms show up. A lot of the recent drugs were designed for what is basically metastatic cancer. Learning more about earlier stages of neurodegeneration, which we can do with PET-ligands designed to bind to fibers, the recent p-tau blood test, etc. is necessary to uh... treat stage 1 or 2 cancer equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I have to get political here, considering recent events. I’m not a professional communicator. Most scientists aren’t. It is things like this that are the reason we are being threatened with funding cuts. Who will read nine paragraphs that I think are necessary context for all of this? But it is much easier to read an article like this, where the same point is repeated multiple times, with some “they said this,” “they said that,” etc. than to understand even a small portion of a field. More people will do the former, and then apparently call for executions without any way to judge who will be executed. And I sit down to write code for my experiments, click on one link, and see what I perceive as harmful information, and there goes apparently half an hour. I can either let this kind of stuff lead to my funding being cut, or reply to it and slow down my research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

                  &lt;div class="commtext c00"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for bringing Berislav Zlokovic to my attention. I will bring him up in the office tomorrow. I have personally never heard of him. Neurodegeneration is a really, really large field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, citation count was a metric I should not have used and also I was just straight-up mistaken about his citation count on that paper. To be honest, citation count is also a lazy argument on my part. I like to think it matters when I think the paper is actually good and that it doesn't matter when I think the paper is bad. A lot of citations get racked up by medical reviews, which are often more highly cited than original work. Keep this in mind when you look at Berislav Zlokovic's "top" papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I genuinely do not think Lesne's work is that influential, though. First, if you look up "amyloid beta oligomer" on grantome (&lt;a href="https://grantome.com/search?q=amyloid+beta+oligomer" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://grantome.com/search?q=amyloid+beta+oligomer&lt;/a&gt;), then look up something like "Alzheimer's amyloid" (to make sure you are not getting amyloids that are not associated with Alzheimer's, since I don't know what other diseases amyloid beta oligomers could possibly be associated with), you will see that amyloid beta oligomer research is actually not well-funded at all compared to everything else in the field. Also, how many papers that cite his work actually work on the amyloid beta 56 oligomer in particular (not rhetorical, I haven't checked)? Maybe this would make for an interesting project for a high schooler or undergrad interested in web-scraping and that kind of data analysis. Probably a question for economists or quantiative sociologists. Now is the time to mention a bit more about what trying to replicate his work would have looked like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of stuff is difficult to replicate not because people are committing fraud, but because people in academia actually "move fast and break things," aka make bad protocols and don't document that well because of pressure to public quickly. Most people doing the work are also graduate students, who are still students. Wet lab work is very, very, very finicky (this is the reason I have gone into more computational projects, I don't possess the level of finesse or patience required). So, some replication problems are because things are both poorly notated and people don't follow protocol perfectly either. But regardless of the causes, some recent experiences that describe what the process would have been like --&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone in our lab recently tried to replicate a protocol for generating recombinant (not brain-extracted, but made from purified protein) amyloid fibers that look like disease-associated fibers. She had previously been one of the only people in our lab who managed to replicate another protocol made by the the same lab (she subsequently taught everyone else in our lab). She was not able to replicate this new one. It took her maybe a month while she was also working on other things to decide she was not going to be apple to replicate it. There were some other tells that we think they were a little lazy, maybe got lucky a few times, and published it in a easy journal just because other people had published far better work on the same topic, so they wanted to wrap up their work and move on while still publishing to keep their grants. Similarly, someone else in our lab went through a two month long process where someone who claimed to be able to make some kind of oligomer send us stuff that turned out to not be an oligomer. First, they blamed the shipping and tried again. Well, next round, same thing. Next, they blamed us. We tried again, same thing. At that point, someone gave them an earful, and now we are kind of sketched out by them. There was some work expended, but again, we work on multiple stuff at once, since most things don't work. And in this case, collaborators sent samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, to summarize, I highly doubt anyone was trying to replicate their results for years, that just isn't how science works. And I don't think amyloid beta oligomer research got that much public funding compared to other things. You do multiple, different experiments every week just to see what sticks. I'm sure plenty of people lost an experiment slot for a few weeks, though. Extremely annoying and part of the general demoralizing slog, but it's not the reason we have no cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why might the Lesne paper have been highly cited? Because oligomers will be important drug targets if they polymerize to amyloid fibers and can be specifically targeted since they are less stable than amyloid fibers, and lots of people working on on them more broadly than just this species might have grabbed this citation because it was a Nature paper with a lot of marketing. From there, citation propagation kept it going. I try to only cite things that I read now, but part of that is probably because my undergrad advisor had the eyes and memory of a hawk and would really hammer everyone on this. I notice bad examples of citation propagation semi-regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some more context for what oligomers really are and why they are so difficult to replicate if they exist -- a fiber exists of many, many proteins stacked. Well, how does the fiber begin? Presumably, you don't go 0 to 100 units perfectly stacked, you go in small increments via pre-fibrillar intermediates. Well, that means you're describing a very transient species, so good luck extracting it from brains or making it recombinantly. Oh, and many amyloid-forming proteins are "intrinsically disordered" meaning they have no "native" structures, and might not be that structured if you have only a few of them stuck together either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've ever been constipated, you're not alone. When it comes to gastrointestinal diseases among adults, &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/1060904/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-are-constipated/" target="_blank"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt; is at the top of the list, and according to &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/constipation" target="_blank"&gt;Johns Hopkins Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, roughly 4 million Americans suffer from frequent constipation accounting for 2.5 million trips to the doctor every year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you can easily get things moving with an over-the-counter laxative like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ex-Lax-Maximum-Strength-Stimulant-Laxative/dp/B000052Y4I/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2K55CWPI8CXF3&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IA5Vq1FMVAKa17kxLa8rfgaI4OcERAfwWF98Snb0jIMzP356UutRSfSp-wpromqUdpiE72jksO_w2exKUF_FD-sRdlCYjf85qsQhC8U_Shd6WIY92O9DE7KNCkgWcTD-TG23tmdtG3PhiVnE9urb-17yvatXJKN3p678ubqxWuggz0h59iNb7K2UbWd_ULtGdtbddZ-N8hoYERIbeV1ifjSV-0uoguglsIOgZsnmQ-GjyDgeM8axiFacYZgkP5EI1WuBeyeTg7ardAjlMCONLNz5wypR70hS0Lroc5T8xSnEw3PraDSpZr05aq2bQ55I2VLaSt84b2Crpf-CqE0UXOOZASVfbfNJ4umabpG5G8lGcRASjaS1q0bkkAI2DF7QsW5KDz6c2Oe95aF0kK5rM0twWQjgcB96ypHD-5fnp0QMB9iK69dQahs2Aynkli_M.Nph4EOKJs3cA7wTab2qlt-QP0c28855NYpZGf4qJ2Ng&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=ex+lax&amp;amp;qid=1739456023&amp;amp;rdc=1&amp;amp;sprefix=ex+lax,aps,208&amp;amp;sr=8-5&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=staticmedia-healthdigest-20" rel="sponsored" target="_blank"&gt;Ex-Lax&lt;/a&gt;, if you're looking for a natural option instead, then you might want to stock up on beets. "The main component in beets that contributes to gut health and regular bowel movements is the fiber content," Courtney Pelitera, a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist at &lt;a href="https://www.topnutritioncoaching.com/weight-loss-nutritionists#courtney-pelitera" target="_blank"&gt;Top Nutrition Coaching&lt;/a&gt;, exclusively told Health Digest, adding that a one-cup serving of beets provides 4 grams of fiber. "For reference, the typical adult requires 25-35g of fiber per day for optimal gut health." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Pelitera further explained, fiber isn't just essential in keeping bowel movements regular, but it also plays a key role in managing both cholesterol and blood glucose levels — both of which positively contribute to heart health. &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/1607709/how-much-fiber-eat-everyday-reduce-early-death-risk/" target="_blank"&gt;Fiber&lt;/a&gt; also keeps us feeling full longer, so we're less likely to snack on unhealthy treats throughout the day — something that's important for those who are trying to keep their calorie count in the healthy range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Beets [also] contain other important nutrients as well, including phytonutrients and antioxidants, which help to reduce inflammatory markers," said Pelitera. In other words, even if you're not suffering from chronic constipation, you should be eating more beets because of all their health benefits. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your main &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/270600/this-is-why-you-should-add-more-beets-to-your-diet/" target="_blank"&gt;reason for incorporating more beets into your diet&lt;/a&gt; is because constipation has become an issue and you're trying to get your bowel movements more regular, your instinct might be to go a bit overboard in the hopes of moving things along faster. However, too many beets could be problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There can always be too much of a good thing," said Pelitera. "With any high fiber foods like root vegetables, eating too many may cause stomach upset, especially if someone is new to introducing high amounts of fiber in the diet, or if fiber is increasing but fluid intake is not increasing." Because of this, Pelitera recommends that if you're increasing your fiber intake, you should be doing the same with your water intake. "The two work together to improve bowel function," said Pelitera, adding that if your poop takes on a vibrant color after you've eaten beets, don't worry about it, because it's completely normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have kidney stones, you also want to monitor your beet consumption. According to &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/the-health-benefits-of-beets" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, beets, both the root and leaves, are high in oxalates which can cause &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/1619072/best-way-to-prevent-kidney-stones-drink-enough-water/" target="_blank"&gt;kidney stones&lt;/a&gt;. So, naturally, if you know you already have or are prone to kidney stones, moderation is important when eating beets.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you love the taste of beets, then you'll probably choose to just boil them and eat them sliced. Or, if you have a juicer, you might consider having a glass of &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/1745361/beet-juice-improve-liver-health/" target="_blank"&gt;beetroot juice&lt;/a&gt; every day. If you've never even had a beet and aren't sure where to start, Pelitera has some suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Personally, I love roasted or grilled beets with a little bit of balsamic vinegar," said Pelitera. "Peel the skin off the outside of the beet, similarly to the way you would peel a potato. You can also boil beets for a more plain, soft texture." If you find you're not a fan of beets but still want to reap their dietary benefits, then disguising them by including them in smoothies, &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/377379/beet-and-goat-cheese-salad-recipe/" target="_blank"&gt;salads&lt;/a&gt;, or sauces is something to consider. "Canned beets work well for this and are a more convenient option," said Pelitera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you just can't get yourself to jump on the beet train, then give beet greens (the leaves) a try instead. In fact, when beets were first discovered, people only ate the greens and used the root medicinally. This went on for hundreds of years until the 19th century when French chefs started preparing the root in ways that garnered it a reputation of being a delicacy. Like the root, beet greens are high in fiber, vitamin A, and vitamin C, and even contain more iron than spinach. Basically, between the greens and the root, beets offer a lot of &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/286750/this-is-how-much-fiber-you-really-need-to-eat-every-day/" target="_blank"&gt;ways to work more fiber into your diet&lt;/a&gt;. It just might take a bit of experimenting to figure out the most delicious way to do that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO2 max – your body’s ability to transport and use oxygen during intense exercise – is more than just a measure of athletic performance. Long regarded as the gold standard for cardiovascular fitness, this key metric, measured in millilitres of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute (ml/kg/min), is now linked to something even more important: longevity. New research reveals that those with a higher VO2 max not only perform better in endurance sports but also have a signifi cantly lower risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, type-2 diabetes, and even premature death. In short, boosting your VO2 max could be one of the most powerful ways to extend your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and human performance specialist Dr David Lipman explains why &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/fitness-guide-how-to-improve-vo2-max-158328" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/fitness-guide-how-to-improve-vo2-max-158328"&gt;VO2 max&lt;/a&gt; is such a reliable indicator of cardiovascular fitness: “It encompasses many body systems. It shows how much you can breathe in and get from your lungs to your blood and from your blood to the muscles.” The higher an athlete’s VO2 max, the more fuel they can burn at their top end. “There is a large genetic component,” adds Lipman, “but it is also trainable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;h2 id="v02-max-through-the-ages-3" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;V02 Max through the ages&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;How high does your VO2 max need to be to reflect prime cardiovascular health?

in a bid to increase longevity is attracting more and more mainstream interest. The question of whether a higher VO2 max equates to a longer life is, of course, compelling. However, Lipman cautions that, in this instance, correlation is not causation. “I think VO2 max is just a measure of the type of lifestyle that will allow you to live longer,” he says. “If you have a good, healthy diet, good body composition, a balance of volume and intensity, and some strength training, it is likely that you will have a high VO2 max.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;One study investigating midlife cardiorespiratory fitness and the longterm risk of mortality, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology in 2018, explored the role played by physical fitness in longevity. The study tracked the relationship between VO2 max and mortality among 5,000 middle-aged men over 46 years. The results showed that each unit increase in VO2 max was associated with a 45-day increase in lifespan. Those with the highest fitness levels lived almost five years longer on average than their less fit counterparts. The study’s long duration and large sample size make it a persuasive piece of evidence that VO2 max isn’t just a measure of performance but a powerful predictor of longevity too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Even so, establishing a causative link is challenging. High VO2 max is often related to consistent physical activity and a generally healthier lifestyle. A much more recent study, published last year in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, sought to unravel the complex relationships between VO2 max and factors including body composition, physical activity and longevity. The study highlighted the importance of other lifestyle and genetic factors such as lean muscle mass and physical activity, and concluded that, despite being a strong predictor of mortality, VO2 max is not causally associated with longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;“VO2 max is measurable and quantifiable,” explains Lipman. “It is an output measure, making it a good indicator that the whole system is in good order.” Maximal oxygen update is an appealing figure to track for anyone focusing on improving their &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/latest-news/benefits-of-cycling-334144" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/latest-news/benefits-of-cycling-334144"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;, but longevity is determined by a complex interplay of many factors. “There are other surprising predictors of longevity such as grip strength and leg strength,” adds Lipman. Just like VO2 max, these benchmarks likely correlate to longer life because strength is one part of the longevity jigsaw puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-PgbPfP2eW9G7kmxUDr2Dpb" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-PgbPfP2eW9G7kmxUDr2Dpb slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;The latest race content, interviews, features, reviews and expert buying guides, direct to your inbox!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id="decline-or-disuse-3" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Decline or disuse?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;VO2 max naturally declines with age, typically at a rate of about 1% per year after age 30. This decline is largely due to physiological changes that occur as part of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/rein-it-in-at-20-get-strong-at-50-expert-advice-on-cycle-training-at-every-age" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/rein-it-in-at-20-get-strong-at-50-expert-advice-on-cycle-training-at-every-age"&gt;ageing process,&lt;/a&gt; such as decreased cardiac output (the amount of blood pumped per beat), reduced muscle mass and lower pulmonary function. However, it can be hard to distinguish between the effects of biological ageing and the effects of reduced physical activity. “It is a case of use it or lose it,” says Lipman, explaining that VO2 max declines more slowly in those who continue to train.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="duration-versus-intensity-3" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Duration versus intensity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="paywall van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;A study published in the Journal of the American Society for Preventative Cardiology in 2007 revealed how controlled endurance exercise impacts aerobic fitness among older adults. This meta-analysis of 41 clinical trials involving 2,102 participants aged 60 and above explored the effects of aerobic exercise on VO2 max. The results indicated a moderate but meaningful increase in VO2 max, translating to a net improvement of 16.3%. The biggest gains accrued to those whose exercise programme extended beyond 20 weeks and who trained at an intensity of 60- 70% of VO2 max.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Lipman urges caution: “Much of the research on older people uses sedentary individuals. Training status is super relevant in such studies.” In other words, untrained people find it easier to make significant improvements. “Most people can increase their VO2 max from the lower end of the range if they are untrained. However, if you are already highly trained, there is less room for improvement.” The good news is that, whether you are new to exercise or an experienced athlete, you can improve or maintain your VO2 max through training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;“There are two types of training you can use to boost your VO2 max,” explains Paul Vousden, owner of endurance sports gym Strength2Speed. “In the absolute simplest terms, you need low-intensity activity where you are a little bit out of breath for a long time, or short but very hard efforts.” In Vousden’s view, while younger riders might focus on boosting their aerobic fitness with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/why-is-everyone-talking-about-zone-2-training-tadej-pogacar-or-rather-his-coach-is-responsible-heres-why" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/why-is-everyone-talking-about-zone-2-training-tadej-pogacar-or-rather-his-coach-is-responsible-heres-why"&gt;long Zone 2 rides&lt;/a&gt;, a better route for veterans is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/training/eight-hiit-workouts-for-faster-rides-476818" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/training/eight-hiit-workouts-for-faster-rides-476818"&gt;shorter, sharper intervals&lt;/a&gt;. “Older riders who have been training for many years already have an endurance base, so the focus on short, hard VO2 intervals allows them more time for recovery than if they were doing long, steady base mileage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;This is a critical point, as the body’s ability to recover decreases with age. But does reducing volume and increasing intensity really work? “We have clients here who concentrate purely on VO2 max and strength,” says Vousden. “One member is a GB duathlete and has very successfully continued to race well into his sixties.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="holistic-approach-3" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Holistic approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Does Lipman agree with this shorter, more intense approach? “From a performance standpoint, you need high and low intensity,” he says. He points out that, at a population level, most of us need to be moving around more – be it walking, cycling or jogging – at a low intensity. “It could be that short doses of high intensity are more important for certain people – if you only have very limited time, high intensity is the way to go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;While maintaining a high VO2 max can contribute significantly to healthier, more resilient ageing, longevity does not revolve around this one factor. It is true that having a higher VO2 max is associated with better health outcomes, but genetic factors, lifestyle choices, environmental influences and access to healthcare all play a part in life expectancy. To live as healthily as possible for as long as possible, we need to take a holistic approach that encompasses strength training, eating well, maintaining good body composition and looking after our mental health. Still, it’s good to know as we’re smashing out those hard reps on the turbo that maintaining a high VO2 max can undoubtedly contribute to a healthier, longer life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-your-v02-max-be-too-high-3" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Can your V02 max be too high?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="paywall van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;A high VO2 max indicates that you’re in a robust state of cardiovascular health. Keeping it high requires lots of training: either plentiful miles or frequent high-intensity sessions, ideally both. But in focusing on maintaining VO2 max, can you go too far and compromise health and potentially longevity – by overdoing it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;The research suggests that, yes, this is indeed a risk. While regular cardio is strongly linked to longer life, a higher incidence of heart problems such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/i-got-diagnosed-with-atrial-fibrillation-how-im-learning-to-be-a-cyclist-with-a-wonky-heart" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/i-got-diagnosed-with-atrial-fibrillation-how-im-learning-to-be-a-cyclist-with-a-wonky-heart"&gt;atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt; and scarring has been recorded among athletes who have undertaken very high-volume, high-intensity exercise over many years. Some experts also have concerns relating to the oxidative stress that may result from prolonged high intensity work. While moderate exercise is anti-inflammatory, excessive endurance training may suppress immune function and increase inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;A 2015 study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology supported the theory of a ‘U-shaped curve’ whereby the lowest mortality risk corresponds to moderate levels of exercise but increases towards the very high end of the volume axis. Light to moderate joggers were found to have the lowest mortality risk, whereas extreme runners had similar mortality rates to sedentary people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Broadly speaking, 75-150 minutes of vigorous exercise per week is considered optimal for most people. Regularly exceeding 10 hours per week pushing above moderate intensity puts you into the zone of potentially undoing the health benefits through excess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="testing-your-vo2-max-3" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;TESTING YOUR VO2 MAX&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="paywall van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="inline-layout "&gt;&lt;div class="caption-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A V02 max test performed in a lab setting provides the most reliable data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Changes to VO2 max take time, so there is little point in testing frequently. “Knowing your VO2 max is not relevant in terms of setting your training zones,” says coach Paul Vousden. If you are following a power-based training schedule, it makes more sense to do a simple &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/i-tried-every-ftp-test-to-find-out-which-is-the-most-accurate" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/i-tried-every-ftp-test-to-find-out-which-is-the-most-accurate"&gt;FTP test&lt;/a&gt; [a test of your &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/ftp-cycling-363865" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/ftp-cycling-363865"&gt;Functional Threshold Power&lt;/a&gt;, the power you can produce over an hour] every few weeks. Even so, VO2 max is a nice-to-know figure to have measured occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;The most accurate method of testing your VO2 max is with a graded exercise test in a lab setting, with a trained technician capturing and measuring expired respiratory gases. Many fitness trackers and&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/group-tests/best-smartwatches-for-cycling-368878" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/group-tests/best-smartwatches-for-cycling-368878"&gt; smartwatches &lt;/a&gt;offer VO2 max estimates based on heart rate data and activity levels, but the accuracy is low. Wearable devices can be useful for tracking trends in fitness over time but treat their VO2 max estimates with caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Mindful that it had been at least a decade since I last had my VO2 max test, this feature provided the perfect incentive for a re-test. Having not followed a serious training for a similar length of time, I was curious to find out how much damage had been done. I visited Mapdec Cycle Works in Kendal, where owner Vousden put me through my paces with 18 minutes of masked-up torture. “There is no point waiting until you are fit to get tested,” he reassured me. “You need to know where you are starting from.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Looking at my numbers, I cringed at my peak power, a wattage I used to warm up at, but I was delighted to find that my VO2 max had remained good, at 53ml/kg/min – a figure classed as excellent for my age. My brief moment of smugness was soon brushed away as Vousden reminded me that VO2 max alone does not equate to race-winning performance. “Using VO2 max as a measure of general well-being is more important than your lactate threshold or your power output,” he began diplomatically, “but if you want to be competitive, we need to see some improvement in power output.”&lt;/p&gt;

Now, new research breaks down a specific chain reaction that happens in the body when you work out—and this discovery may even help prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.14369" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Aging Cell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Aging Cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, suggests that exercise can do your brain health a solid on several fronts. Here’s what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the expert&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://kines.rutgers.edu/faculty/faculty/faculty-profile/317-full-time-faculty/1122-malin-steven-k" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Steven K.

They also had a glucose drink before and after their workouts, and gave blood samples during these times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the participants worked out, the researchers discovered that there was an increase in the number of neuronal vesicles, which are special cells released by the brain. Those vesicles, which were once thought to be “cell dust,” help to shuttle molecules like proteins to cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, the vesicles carried proteins that are involved in insulin sensitivity—which is the body’s ability to respond to the hormone insulin—to the brain. (Insulin helps your body absorb glucose, aka sugar, from your bloodstream to give you energy.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gets a little technical but basically, the study found that exercise improves the ability of brain cells to respond to insulin—and that can help thinking, memory, and brain health, including lowering the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and similar dementias in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the relationship between exercise and insulin sensitivity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is believed to help make tissues in the body more sensitive to insulin, according to lead study author &lt;a href="https://kines.rutgers.edu/faculty/faculty/faculty-profile/317-full-time-faculty/1122-malin-steven-k" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Steven K. Malin, PhD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Steven K. Malin, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor in the Department of Kinesiology and Health at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, your body can become better at using insulin at lower blood sugar levels, helping you to manage conditions like type 2 diabetes and your overall metabolic health, according to the &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/health-wellness/fitness/blood-glucose-and-exercise" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Diabetes Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Diabetes Association&lt;/a&gt; (ADA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue are commonly studied in the exercise field, less is known about the brain,” Malin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this all relate to brain health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It actually has a lot to do with your noggin. “Insulin is important for brain cells— neurons—to execute various functions, including cognition,” Malin explains. But as you get older, less insulin may appear in your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insulin has an important role in memory formation, processing speed, recall, and more. If there isn't enough insulin in your brain, brain cells may stop interacting with each other properly, leading to conditions like dementia, Malin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Brain insulin resistance may develop because neurons experience—'see'—less insulin,” Malin says. But doing something to help support insulin sensitivity in your brain by, say, exercising, can help to counteract some of that, he explains. As a result, supporting your body's insulin sensitivity can ultimately boost your brain health and lower the risk of developing dementia, Malin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much exercise actually protects against dementia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s tough to put a hard and fast number on this, but this particular study found that regular workouts over a two-week period made a difference in the brain. “Most evidence suggests that any activity is good,” says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/geriatric-medicine/ca/santa-monica/scott-kaiser-1205042470" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scott Kaiser, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Scott Kaiser, MD&lt;/a&gt;, is a geriatrician and director of geriatric cognitive health for the Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise may help lower your dementia risk by about &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/reduce-your-risk-of-dementia/physical-activity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:20%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;20%&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the type, Malin says. “From this, it seems fair to suggest exercise, along with diet and mental activities, are foundational lifestyle approaches maintain and improve brain health,” Malin says. “Exercise should absolutely be a tool in the toolbox.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 17:03:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1xenFDQjFoVWFEbW5NYmNERVk0U3JpZ1haaERRa295OVFfQTBLcHFLV3lYd1czOW5RZHY2MG40djV4QTQ5VUxyNnhobFFiMnQ1NEppNDVkek0yLUNfRzBKVkFaeEU5TE9GcUJoaGQ5V3JGSFk</guid></item><item><title>Hays County issues measles alert after possible exposure in San Marcos - KVUE.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizAFBVV95cUxQMi1nU1Nxd1dzUnd4aHFhdjI5VkRKYjZ5N1VwcmRWei00ajJtWEF0MGM1aFpyM3BjaUN2UUhWV0xzZ1l1anFkaFZkYWtYa1p2aER2YXdoMW52X2dhbUR4VzE4N2NmNlR6cnVuQmZrb0NROVpycUFaM3hpV1VTc3V4dHltaHA2bi1MZFp4UnVjWUFST2VhaldzYzdmWVU5bnY0TjI5Q1plQ0NCVHQ3Zi14ekRtcllHQUp4VnM3VUxYS2NreVQwb3lieFZjNnI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;The Hays County Health Department provided a map and times of possible measles exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN MARCOS, Texas — Health officials in Hays County are warning residents about a possible measles exposure after a person who tested positive for the illness visited San Marcos on Feb. 14.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Hays County Health Department, a Gaines County resident who tested positive for measles was in San Marcos from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. that Friday.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who were at Texas State University from approximately 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. and Twin Peaks Restaurant from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. may be at risk of developing measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals who may have been exposed will be notified by their local health authority, health officials said. The Hays County Health Department, the Texas Department of State Health Services and other local health agencies are working together to investigate potential contacts.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a highly contagious airborne disease spread by contact with an infected person through coughing and sneezing. Texas is currently experiencing the largest outbreak of measles in decades,” said Hays County Local Health Authority John Turner, MD. “Individuals who have not been vaccinated are at greater risk of infection. To minimize the risk of infection and serious illness, individuals should make sure they are vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ninety percent of people who are not vaccinated or have not had a previous measles infection will become infected with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department will contact people who are known to have been in contact with the person who later tested positive for measles to provide guidance.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone with any symptoms is asked to contact their primary care provider, urgent care or an emergency room to set up an appointment and quarantine for four days after the onset of a rash.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who were in the possible exposure locations during the specified times should:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review their immunization and medical records. People who have not had measles or have not been vaccinated should talk with a health care provider about MMR immunization&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact their health care provider as soon as possible about a potential exposure if they are pregnant, have an infant or have a weakened immune system, regardless of vaccination history.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor themselves for illness with fever and/or an unexplained rash from four days to 21 days after exposure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If symptoms develop, stay at home and avoid school, work and any large gatherings. Call a health care provider immediately. Do not enter a health care facility before calling and making them aware of your measles exposure and symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Hays County Health Department is acting with haste to ensure the readiness and preparedness of partner agencies in response to this notification,” said Hays County Judge Ruben Beccera. “The county has taken great strides to improve our response to public health emergencies. I am confident that the department will be capable of minimizing the impact of a potential measles outbreak in our county. I will work with the [health] department and Office of Emergency Services to offer additional resources as needed.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles spreads easily through the air when an infected person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. The virus can stay in the air and on surfaces for two hours, even after the infected person has left.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infected person can spread the disease up to four days before a measles rash appears and up to four days after the rash appears.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses or mouths, they can become infected.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common symptoms for measles include:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (as high as 105 degrees)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red and watery eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny white spots that may appear inside the mouth two to three days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash three to five days after other signs of illness. The “measles rash” typically starts at the face and then spreads down to the rest of the body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

It comes after shocking cases emerged of the lungs of heavy users collapsing, as well as fainting and throwing up a mystery green liquid.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="image-container" data-redesign-embed="true"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Boidin added that there is also evidence that fitness levels can be affected by excessive use of the products, which are currently recommended by the NHS as a smoking cessation tool. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Boidin met with the &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk"&gt;Mirror&lt;/a&gt; toward the end of the study. He explained the reason behind his findings: “Smokers tend to go outside and smoke, and once a cigarette is finished they have to light up another to keep going. But with vapes, you just keep going and it’s much harder to know how many puffs you’ve had. It’s much easier to vape continuously because you can do it in places where smoking might be less acceptable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What we have found is the dangers for someone who keeps vaping are no different from smokers. At the beginning (of the study) I also believed that vaping was more beneficial than smoking. You see a lot more people vaping these days because they don’t think it’s too bad. Many will be horrified to know the truth.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Study participants were aged between 18 and 45, all with similar levels of fitness ability. They were put under stress tests to measure the speed of blood flow to their brains, and the elasticity of their blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What they found was that vapers appeared to have damaged artery walls which were unable to dilate. This is said to be an indicator of future cardiovascular problems. Dr Boidin blames the findings on nicotine, propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin irritating the delicate blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He says: “When you put this mixture of metals and chemicals into your body you can’t expect nothing to happen.” Vaping use in the UK has exploded since the first electronic cigarettes arrived here in 2005. There are now 5.1million people aged 16 or over in Britain - about one in ten - using vapes, according to figures last year from the Office for National Statistics. Vaping rates were highest among those aged 16 to 24, at 15.8%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"One million people in England now vape, despite never having been regular smokers, a seven-fold increase in three years, according to a University College London study published in The Lancet Public Health Journal. And, despite recent vaping scares, like the death this year of Hollyoaks star Paul Danan, aged 46, who months earlier revealed he’d had to be revived after suffering respiratory failure caused by excessive vaping, Public Health England is still advising that “vaping poses a small fraction of the risks of smoking”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Vaping side effects&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heart disease&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dementia&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Organ failure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;scroll-depth-observer data-event-markers="1%,25%,50%,75%,90%,100%"&gt;&lt;/scroll-depth-observer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Mirror</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 16:21:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQU2FuYmI4aVoyWF94RjJNSkJEcEk4cEc5aW5jNkdyeHdVQ202M0Niamdxb182cWx2VkRiWmxRVHE1bXl5d0dIenpjT1RsXzAwa1FfZGo1QUtIN1JfLUI4YjdiSWFkMkR1VnBELXZYOTh1RS1GREs3aERtMGFNcjNSYkVqbmMzNXFsS0HSAY8BQVVfeXFMTWUxV3d5Rk9IeWdlQ1o2S3ZSNktsUUFCSm9haDVfcmQxWHRwR2VpR1hvaEQwc3BFRmdrOWRwNlgyWUdDVXdISTRFZUVjNHN4N2FEQWVhMFNVMkhfRno2SUtQWXhoYWxFc3lJS1lNU19aWFdfUE5kVFNYdHlrTlpybXcxU2wxem5PVjk0ZlIwQm8</guid></item><item><title>Can adding a pinch of Cinnamon to regular tea reduce sugar levels? - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you someone who swears by tea and loves indulging in it, then you need to pause and read on! Managing blood sugar levels is a key concern for individuals with diabetes or those at risk of developing it. Well, if you are a tea lover then leaving tea can be tough, but just by adding cinnamon you can regulate blood sugar levels naturally. Interestingly, just by adding a pinch of cinnamon to your regular tea, you can simply make a difference in managing sugar levels? Here's how...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinnamon's effect on blood sugar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinnamon contains bioactive compounds, including cinnamaldehyde, which have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce blood sugar levels. Studies suggest that cinnamon may mimic insulin's effects, helping cells absorb glucose more efficiently. By improving insulin sensitivity, cinnamon can reduce the need for higher amounts of insulin, which is especially helpful for people with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How cinnamon enhances regular tea&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tea, especially green or black tea, is rich in antioxidants and polyphenols, which have been linked to a variety of health benefits, including improved metabolic function and reduced inflammation. Adding cinnamon to regular tea not only enhances its flavor but may also amplify the tea’s blood sugar-lowering effects. Both tea and cinnamon work together to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the rate at which sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, helping to stabilize blood sugar levels after meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potential benefits for diabetics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For individuals with diabetes, managing post-meal blood sugar spikes is crucial. Cinnamon, when added to tea, may help moderate these spikes by slowing down the absorption of glucose from the digestive tract into the bloodstream. While cinnamon alone is unlikely to replace diabetes medications, it can be a complementary addition to a balanced diet and exercise routine. Many studies show that regular cinnamon consumption over time may lead to a modest reduction in fasting blood glucose levels, making it a useful adjunct in diabetes management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to add cinnamon to tea?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding cinnamon to tea is easy and can be done in a couple of ways. You can simply add a pinch of ground cinnamon to your brewed tea and stir well. For a more intense flavor, you can steep a cinnamon stick in the tea while it brews. If you prefer a sweeter taste, cinnamon can be paired with other naturally sweet herbs or spices like ginger or cloves, enhancing both the flavor and health benefits of the tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 15:21:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxOME5LQktHYVZQczBTWFBEaHAxWXpYSGNRdU5nYUJCTDBYLWc5OW5zbzQ5QXpPeTYyRHZrRmRKb0xyMUFZWGZXTmxuemRIU1VmRU1wYTVWUU9UX2VCcGlKc0k1NFVHUDdnS0p2TUs0SzFNQVcwQmdDb05mLWp4a3NxQ21Ydi1STTdjS2p0SGFfMExCMGFxenJqcHdSb2tHbzFLM3Q5U05nWS12a2dZTDBtUU5kOXpqaVJMbzEtMERlU0djazg2clJaMVBlTGxHYkZ3WXZIREV6QV9YdHUwTG4wY3hB0gHnAUFVX3lxTE05b3laaVlVUHREUU1FcjlVaGl5S0JUNXNPVW4tVFZTSFJEbUxGOVQ4Z0NHdEV1eDRNc1RvVmhadURUdHBZSkMtNEZ4VGZqWmowUXlUTTg3MFU3R1NTc0VIQXg3aHV1YURpUE1SazFYdUZVUXkyV01fZlJxU0piTDZYbkNXTlBiWVg4Ync5SXk4d3pBU2ZzdzU3ZkxLY1hCMXRCUW4tZTZoN29aNDg3SHhBVDViT1YtYkZ3Y3JqTGFzUEUxNXBqSG1YWDEyQzlBNDFLSVBiemFkdzFIVnlMNkpWOXoxdUc2MA</guid></item><item><title>6 ‘Bad’ Foods You Should Be Eating to Help Manage High Blood Pressure, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE8yLU9TUkhHeWh3aXp5UDdia2N3UDRYZ3NJcnRQZ004N0l4UVRZQXhUU0ZISl9ycVotblN2LS0zd0VSS0oydXUyZU5fTWlReklwa09RaGtJRjJ4X25wVVZ6VDlQV2hSV2Z5dDJ6Wnl6OGtJZXpQM2gxaw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re trying to manage—or prevent—high blood pressure, it can sometimes be hard to know what to eat.

Unfortunately, though, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8078393/do-bananas-lower-blood-pressure/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bananas &lt;/a&gt;are often demonized for their carbohydrate and sugar content, says Atlanta-based registered dietitian &lt;a href="http://nk-fitness.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nijya Noble, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But many people don’t know that bananas also pack a dynamic duo of blood pressure–lowering fiber and potassium (3 grams of fiber and 422 milligrams of potassium per medium banana).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; How do they work? “[Potassium is] a key mineral that helps regulate blood pressure by preventing the effects of sodium and relaxing blood vessel walls,” explains Noble. “Potassium-rich diets are consistently linked to lower blood pressure levels,” she adds. “Plus, the fiber in bananas helps moderate the release of sugar into the bloodstream, making them a healthy choice when consumed in moderation.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And there’s proof they work! One study found that eating bananas three to six times per week was associated with a 24% reduction in risk of all-cause mortality in people with hypertension.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-avocados"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Avocados  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The green goddess fruit has risen in popularity thanks to the avocado toast trend. Yet the number of people who still think they should avoid them is shocking, especially considering their blood pressure benefits. Noble agrees. “Avocados are an excellent source of potassium and monounsaturated fats, which support heart health and help lower blood pressure,” she says. “They also contain antioxidants and fiber, contributing to overall cardiovascular health.” Yes, they are calorie-dense, she says, but their fat is &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fat-for-heart-health-8644218" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart-healthy unsaturated fat.&lt;/a&gt; As long as you keep an eye on portion size, they can be a great addition to a blood pressure-lowering eating plan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They’re so effective, in fact, that one study found that women who ate 2½ avocados per week were 17% less likely to have hypertension than women who rarely or never ate avocados.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; With 3 grams of fiber, 242 milligrams of potassium and 6 grams of heart-healthy unsaturated fats per ⅓ avocado, it’s no wonder this delicious, nutritious fruit promotes better blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-frozen-fruits--vegetables"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Frozen Fruits &amp;amp; Vegetables  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When many people hear the words “frozen food,” they automatically assume the entire category is off-limits, thanks to archaic images of prepackaged TV dinners bubbling up. This myth couldn’t be further from the truth, says dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.patriciabannan.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Patricia Bannan, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;From Burnout to Balance&lt;/em&gt;. “Frozen foods often get a bad reputation because people assume they’re loaded with sodium and preservatives. But science tells a different story,” she says. “Flash-freezing locks in nutrients that support healthy blood pressure, like potassium, fiber and antioxidants. For blood pressure management, frozen fruits and vegetables are particularly valuable because they’re frozen at peak ripeness when their nutrient content is highest.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Because frozen foods don’t spoil quickly, they’re unlikely to wilt in your crisper or end up in the trash. That doesn’t just cut down on trips to the store. It makes eating those blood pressure-lowering fruits and veggies easier.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-low-fat-greek-yogurt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Low-Fat Greek Yogurt  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Some people believe dairy is unhealthy due to its saturated fat and cholesterol content,” says Noble. “However, choosing low-fat options minimizes these issues.” Plus, dairy foods are filled with nutrients like calcium, potassium and magnesium that help regulate blood pressure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research reveals that yogurt may be particularly beneficial.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “The high protein content of Greek yogurt helps with satiety and maintaining a healthy weight, key factors in blood pressure management,” says Bannan. “The protein in dairy also contains specific peptides that may help lower blood pressure.” To keep fat and added sugar in check, experts recommend choosing unsweetened, low-fat or nonfat Greek yogurt and sweetening it with fruit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-low-sodium-nuts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Low-Sodium Nuts &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Small but mighty, nuts are nutrient powerhouses.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; At the same time, they’re so compact that their calories can add up quickly. Plus, some are swimming in salt, which can mean extra &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/can-you-eat-salt-if-you-have-high-blood-pressure-8412363" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sodium&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But don’t let that stop you! Nuts are a delicious way to work more potassium into your diet. And there are plenty of low-sodium and unsalted varieties to choose from. “Nuts [also] provide a powerful combination of healthy fats, plant-based protein and fiber, a trio of nutrients that work together to support heart health,” says Bannan. In fact, a large body of research shows that eating nuts can also reduce total and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Still worried about their calories? The key, says Bannan, is portion control, so stick with 1-ounce portions (about ¼ cup). 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A popular misconception is that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7969228/is-soy-bad-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soy foods&lt;/a&gt; are highly processed and should be avoided. This couldn’t be further from the truth! Research has found that a soy-rich diet may significantly lower blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; What makes it so powerful? “Soy foods, like edamame, tofu, soy milk and tempeh, are rich in isoflavones that help improve blood vessel function and reduce inflammation,” says Bannan. “These compounds boost enzymes that increase nitric oxide production, which helps widen blood vessels and reduce blood pressure.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If soy foods aren’t a regular part of your diet, try this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-lunch-for-high-blood-pressure-8584638" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vegan Superfood Grain Bowl&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Managing high blood pressure requires healthy, balanced dietary choices. However, there’s a lot of misinformation out there about which foods are good and bad for blood pressure. Despite what you may have heard, nutrition experts agree that bananas, avocados, frozen fruits and vegetables, low-fat yogurt, low-sodium nuts and soy foods are all excellent choices for lowering blood pressure. If you’re living with high blood pressure and could still use some extra guidance, speak with a registered dietitian who can help you develop a personalized plan to bring your numbers down.

Researchers found that older adults with lower biologically active B12 had slower cognitive processing and more white matter lesions, despite meeting current nutritional requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that the definition of B12 deficiency may need revision to incorporate functional biomarkers rather than relying on fixed thresholds. Researchers recommend further study and potential supplementation for older adults to prevent cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtle Cognitive Decline:&lt;/strong&gt; Older adults with lower active B12 levels performed worse on cognitive tests measuring processing speed and reaction times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Lesions:&lt;/strong&gt; MRI scans revealed increased white matter lesions in participants with lower B12, which may contribute to dementia and stroke risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revisiting B12 Guidelines:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers suggest current B12 recommendations may be insufficient for preventing neurological decline and warrant reassessment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meeting the minimum requirement for vitamin B12, needed to make DNA, red blood cells and nerve tissue, may not actually be enough – particularly if you are older. It may even put you at risk for cognitive impairment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study, led by UC San Francisco researchers, found that older, healthy volunteers, with lower concentrations of B12, but still in the normal range, showed signs of neurological and cognitive deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt; &lt;iframe title="Cognitive Slowness and Decline Linked to Low-Normal B12 Levels" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E8k9cjwbKgY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video Credit: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Neuroscience" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These levels were associated with more damage to the brain’s white matter – the nerve fibers that enable communication between areas of the brain – and test scores associated with slower cognitive and visual processing speeds, compared to those with higher B12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study published in &lt;em&gt;Annals of Neurology&lt;/em&gt; on Feb. 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers led by senior author Ari J. Green, MD, of the UCSF Departments of Neurology and Ophthalmology and the Weill Institute for Neurosciences, said that the results raise questions about current B12 requirements and suggest the recommendations need updating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previous studies that defined healthy amounts of B12 may have missed subtle functional manifestations of high or low levels that can affect people without causing overt symptoms,” said Green, noting that clear deficiencies of the vitamin are commonly associated with a type of anemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Revisiting the definition of B12 deficiency to incorporate functional biomarkers could lead to earlier intervention and prevention of cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower B12 correlates with slower processing speeds, brain lesions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers enrolled 231 healthy participants without dementia or mild cognitive impairment, whose average age was 71. They were recruited through the Brain Aging Network for Cognitive Health (BrANCH) study at UCSF. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their blood B12 amounts averaged 414.8 pmol/L, well above the U.S. minimum of 148 pmol/L. Adjusted for factors like age, sex, education and cardiovascular risks, researchers looked at the biologically active component of B12, which provides a more accurate measure of the amount of the vitamin that the body can utilize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cognitive testing, participants with lower active B12 were found to have slower processing speed, relating to subtle cognitive decline. Its impact was amplified by older age. They also showed significant delays responding to visual stimuli, indicating slower visual processing speeds and general slower brain conductivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MRIs revealed a higher volume of lesions in the participants’ white matter, which may be associated with cognitive decline, dementia or stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study volunteers were older adults, who may have a specific vulnerability to lower levels of B12, co-first author Alexandra Beaudry-Richard, MSc, said that these lower levels could “impact cognition to a greater extent than what we previously thought, and may affect a much larger proportion of the population than we realize.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beaudry-Richard is currently completing her doctorate in research and medicine at the UCSF Department of Neurology and the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Ottawa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107923"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;They also showed significant delays responding to visual stimuli, indicating slower visual processing speeds and general slower brain conductivity.

While the association between B12 deficiency and neurological dysfunction is well-known, the exact threshold for adequacy remains undefined in terms of functional impairment and evidence of injury. The objective was to assess whether B12 levels within the current normal range in a cohort of healthy older adults may be associated with measurable evidence of neurological injury or dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ana27200-sec-0002-title"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We enrolled 231 healthy elderly volunteers (median age 71.2 years old) with a median B12 blood concentration of 414.8 pmol/L (as measured by automated chemiluminescence assay). We performed multifocal visual evoked potential testing, processing speed testing, and magnetic resonance imaging to assess neurological status. Moreover, we measured serum biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury, astrocyte involvement, and amyloid pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ana27200-sec-0003-title"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low (log-transformed) B12, especially decreased holo-transcobalamin, was associated with visual evoked potential latency delay (estimate = −0.04; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.023), processing speed impairment (in an age-dependent manner; standardized β = −2.39; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.006), and larger volumes of white matter hyperintensities on MRI (β = −0.21; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.039). Remarkably, high levels of holo-haptocorrin (biologically inactive fraction of B12) correlated with serum levels of Tau, a biomarker of neurodegeneration (β = 0.22, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.015).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ana27200-sec-0004-title"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy older subjects exhibit neurological changes at both ends of the measurable “normal” B12 spectrum. These findings challenge our current understanding of optimal serum B12 levels and suggest revisiting how we establish appropriate nutritional recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 14:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5sMkhWM0lrOUVuNDkyZnhuZ2c2Q3F4N2xORlpzNVc3dUZzellPUl96ajh2M0ZuTlNkMU9WekprOElnNzU2MVdLMjlfSUt2cWtyRjVMOFIxZGFqTFphRGZ5YWd0eC1YbmotWmY1aXZya2w1TFk</guid></item><item><title>Utah mom living with heart defect urges women to take charge of their health - KSL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxNaVk3RmlSWjNPREhBeHlfeXFHZFRpNHlpTjl2Mkl6SGQ2b0IzSjBzXzFWdXhFNVIyenN3QWRrTGZmRlhGUnZScGwtd3YySTgwb01CMU1RU0ktUnZRZFhmR0NxczRqNkxvTmRCaUk5TC01U28tY3k0aExBdGt3Yk1oWDNlV0k2T0Y5ejBTTDlZSDlyM2N0Nzd2WDUySGh6cnFFSHZnYU1kYlZHMEpaZ2w1T3N4SQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I try really hard just to listen to my body and don't overexert myself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams was born with an atrioventricular canal defect, a congenital heart defect where a hole between the heart chambers prevents proper blood flow. Her condition led to several surgeries and placed limitations on her childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wanted to play soccer, and I couldn't," she said. "I just felt like the condition was ruling my life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the U.S., and millions of adults and children are living with heart defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Williams didn't think the condition was hereditary, her daughter was also diagnosed with a similar heart defect and underwent open-heart surgery at the age of 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Fallon Williams is a busy mom of two who is also living with a cardiac condition.

"I didn't want her to go through the same things of not being able to play soccer if she wanted to or not be able to go play dodgeball with her friends. I just didn't want her to have those same limitations that I have."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect, affecting nearly 40,000 U.S. babies per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams' journey hasn't been easy, but she and her family are navigating the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fallon has been able to strengthen her heart through medication and through fitness — she even now teaches indoor cycling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel like anything is possible, even with these heart conditions," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She wants other women to make their health a priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cardiac defects are the number one killer of women. Women wear so many hats, and we don't always take time for ourselves, especially mothers," she said. "Make sure that you know your numbers. Your blood pressure numbers, your resting heart rate, your heart rate when you're working out, if any of those seem off, just go to the doctor. Just get yourself checked out, because you never know if you could be one of those numbers in those statistics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams was nominated to be a Woman of Impact with the American Heart Association, where she is helping raise money for heart health research.

Now, new research suggests that certain bacteria in your mouth could play a role in your risk of developing Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is a complicated condition, with many different factors that influence when and if a person develops it. But the latest findings suggest what’s happening in your mouth could be linked on some level with your brain health. Here’s the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the expert&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/jennifer-bramen/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jennifer Bramen, PhD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jennifer Bramen, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, is a senior research scientist and director of neuroimaging at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA; &lt;a href="https://www.dental.upenn.edu/faculty/mark-s-wolff/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mark S.

The participants were broken into two groups: One group had no detectable decline in brain function, while the others had mild cognitive impairment, a condition where people have more memory or thinking problems than others their age. People with mild cognitive impairment are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease or dementia, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.gov/alzheimers-dementias/mild-cognitive-impairment" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute on Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt; (NIA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study participants provided the scientists with mouth rinse samples, which were then analyzed, allowing the researchers to break down the bacteria contained in each sample. The researchers discovered that certain bacteria found in the participants’ mouths were linked with having better memory and attention; Others were associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which bacteria are associated with memory and attention?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study found that people who had large amounts of the bacteria Neisseria and Haemophilus had better memory and attention. They also could do complex tasks more easily, based on the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which bacteria are linked with memory loss?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that people who had higher levels of the bacteria Porphyromonas (a key pathogen in chronic periodontitis) in their mouths were more likely to have memory problems. The bacteria Prevotella (also commonly found in peridontel disease) was also associated with people having the gene APOE4, which is linked to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does mouth bacteria impact brain health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/large-study-links-gum-disease-dementia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:several;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36404545/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; that have &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/dad2.12172" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:linked;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; bacteria in the mouth to dementia. &lt;a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2021/april/gum-bacteria-alzheimers.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has generally suggested that having higher levels of harmful bacteria in the mouth may raise the risk of bodily inflammation, which could potentially &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; raise the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers in this study theorized that harmful bacteria could get into the bloodstream and damage the brain, raising the risk of Alzheimer's disease. They also suggest that a bacterial imbalance could impact how much nitric oxide is formed from nitrate, a compound in vegetables. Nitric oxide is important for memory and communication in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s hard to say for sure that the bacteria causes dementia or issues with brain health, says &lt;a href="https://www.dental.upenn.edu/faculty/mark-s-wolff/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mark S. Wolff, DDS, PhD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mark S. Wolff, DDS, PhD,&lt;/a&gt; dean of the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to be careful not to assert a cause and effect when both of these things may just be happening at the same time,” he says. “People can have bad gum disease, and lots of bacteria, and develop Alzheimer's disease. Did one cause the other or did they just both occur because we weren't taking good care of our mouth while we were developing the Alzheimer's disease?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I make sure to have the “good bacteria” in my mouth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating a plant-based diet seems to be a good start, according to &lt;a href="https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/jennifer-bramen/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jennifer Bramen, PhD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jennifer Bramen, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, a senior research scientist and director of neuroimaging at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding nitrate-rich foods like veggies into your diet “can benefit the oral microbiome by promoting bacteria associated with better oral and cognitive health outcomes,” she says. This may also help to suppress bacteria that’s linked with dementia, Bramen explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, it’s hard to say at this point that these bacteria cause Alzheimer’s disease, they're just linked. But it's never a bad idea to up your veggie intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 14:50:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE9QZHVYek1uS0FuMk1XM2dGand1V0RtRE9GeG5EWjQ5ZTBPTTgwMWh0VDFobFl6NzNlVW5JSS1vS0oxTFJiejQxMFMyYkhPMlFoWHhoZ1VMUlZWQXBMZTIxU1dmWVNvWDFMTEl2U3lCVXpYQQ</guid></item><item><title>Genetic Mutation Linked to Schizophrenia Alters Brain Function - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE1DMUhCdWlvUnpIOWt1OG1JaVk1dHlHMFQxVUpRcXBMbVR1WXdHVWgzdG5jTnY0amo2Y1FIV0hpeDdod0hZODl1MDdueVR6TkwyUjVXelpGUS12LWFuaUgzYlJ5UHkwRDg3azhGUHdhQkowdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers identified a rare genetic mutation in two schizophrenia patients that increased schizophrenia-related behaviors in mice. The mutation led to higher levels of glycine decarboxylase (GLDC), an enzyme that degrades glycine, reducing NMDA receptor activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice with extra copies of the GLDC gene exhibited schizophrenia-like behaviors, confirming its role in the condition. Advanced brain analysis showed that available glycine was significantly lower in a specific brain region, disrupting neural signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Extra copies of the GLDC gene led to schizophrenia-like behaviors in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; The mutation lowered glycine availability in a key brain region, impairing NMDA receptor function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Reduced synaptic activity and impaired learning-related brain functions were observed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Illinois&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A genetic mutation found in two human patients with schizophrenia also increased schizophrenia-related behaviors in mice with the same mutation, a rare finding of a direct genetic link to psychosis, report researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and colleagues in Massachusetts and Germany.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mutation increases levels of glycine decarboxylase, or GLDC, an enzyme responsible for regulating glycine in the brain.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The genetics of schizophrenia is very complex, and it is rare that mutations found in patients can be linked directly to the disease,” said study leader Uwe Rudolph, a professor of comparative biosciences at Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Schizophrenia is not yet diagnosed by any kind of lab test or imaging; it’s still a clinical diagnosis based on symptoms. The hope is that these kinds of rare mutations could lead us to the biochemical and physiological pathways that are important to study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study began when a genetic mutation was found in two patients with schizophrenia at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass. They had multiple copies of a section of DNA that included the gene for GLDC. Curious as to whether the mutation contributed to their symptoms, the McLean team studying the patients reached out to Rudolph’s lab to create a line of mice with the same mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice with mutations analogous to those in the human patients also showed schizophrenia-associated behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further narrow down the genetic link, the researchers next developed lines of mice with multiple copies of only a few genes contained within the larger chromosome segment repeated in the patients, then a single gene: GLDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that extra copies of the GLDC gene alone were sufficient to render the schizophrenia-like behaviors we had observed,” said Rudolph, who also is affiliated with the Neuroscience Program and the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology at Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why multiple copies of the GLDC gene would be solely responsible for the behavioral symptoms, the researchers took a closer look at what was happening in the brains of the mice, specifically to the levels of glycine and the function of NDMA receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hypothesized that extra copies of GLDC would result in a lower level of glycine in the brain, since it degrades glycine. Then there would not be enough glycine to help activate the NDMA receptors,” said Illinois postdoctoral researcher Maltesh Kambali, the first author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “We measured an increase in activity of the GLDC enzyme in the brains of our mice, which would point to that as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when the researchers measured glycine levels in the brains of their mice, there did not seem to be a significant difference between those with the extra GLDC and healthy mice. So Rudolph’s team turned to colleagues in Germany who had developed sophisticated methods of tracking glycine in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The German team found that, while the overall amount of glycine in the whole brain was similar, the amount of glycine outside of the nerve cells and available to help activate NDMA receptors was significantly lower in a subregion of the hippocampus in the mice with multiple copies of GLDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see why this region of the brain was so affected, Rudolph’s team then worked with researchers at Harvard Medical School to perform functional studies on the affected brain subregion, called the dentate gyrus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They identified decreased activity in the neural synapses, the active junctions that send signals between neurons. They pinpointed differences in long-term potentiation, a sustained strengthening of activity in the synapse during the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We saw how glycine measurements and the long-term potentiation measurements were showing converging changes in this dentate gyrus region, but not in other regions of the hippocampus. It’s interesting because one theory links the development of psychosis to the activity in the dentate gyrus. So our findings fit with that theory,” Kambali said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Illinois team then conducted a biochemical analysis of the dentate gyrus in the mice with extra copies of GLDC. They found that some pathways previously implicated in schizophrenia had reduce activity, indicating that the increase of GLDC and associated decrease of glycine was indeed sufficient to inhibit the NMDA receptors’ function and was involved in the schizophrenia symptoms they had observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers published their findings in the journal &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study demonstrated at multiple levels how GLDC functions as a novel regulator of NMDA receptors,” Rudolph said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dysfunction of NMDA receptors has been shown to be important in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Yet this finding also is relevant independently of disease, as the NMDA receptor is essential for many brain functions, including learning and memory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health, the Shervert Frazier Research Institute at McLean Hospital, the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, and a Harvard Brain Science Initiative Bipolar Disorder Seed Grant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health grants R21MH104505, R56MH112642, R01MH115957, R01HD096326, R01MH123155, R01NS093200, P50MH115874, R01MH123993, R01MH108665, R01MH051290, P50MH094271 and U01AA020889.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this schizophrenia and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fd989c95919f988f9abd949191949392948ed3989988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Liz Ahlberg Touchstone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://illinois.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Illinois&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Liz Ahlberg Touchstone – University of Illinois&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research:&lt;/strong&gt; Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-024-02711-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;An increased copy number of glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) associated with psychosis reduces extracellular glycine and impairs NMDA receptor functio&lt;/a&gt;n” by Uwe Rudolph et al. &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An increased copy number of glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) associated with psychosis reduces extracellular glycine and impairs NMDA receptor function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glycine is an obligatory co-agonist at excitatory NMDA receptors in the brain, especially in the dentate gyrus, which has been postulated to be crucial for the development of psychotic associations and memories with psychotic content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugs modulating glycine levels are in clinical development for improving cognition in schizophrenia. However, the functional relevance of the regulation of glycine metabolism by endogenous enzymes is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a chromosome-engineered allelic series in mice, we report that a triplication of the gene encoding the glycine-catabolizing enzyme glycine decarboxylase (&lt;em&gt;GLDC&lt;/em&gt;) – as found on a small supernumerary marker chromosome in patients with psychosis – reduces extracellular glycine levels as determined by optical fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in dentate gyrus (DG) and suppresses long-term potentiation (LTP) in mPP-DG synapses but not in CA3-CA1 synapses, reduces the activity of biochemical pathways implicated in schizophrenia and mitochondrial bioenergetics, and displays deficits in schizophrenia-like behaviors which are in part known to be dependent on the activity of the dentate gyrus, e.g., prepulse inhibition, startle habituation, latent inhibition, working memory, sociability and social preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results demonstrate that &lt;em&gt;Gldc&lt;/em&gt; negatively regulates long-term synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus in mice, suggesting that an increase in &lt;em&gt;GLDC&lt;/em&gt; copy number possibly contributes to the development of psychosis in humans.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 14:33:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE1DMUhCdWlvUnpIOWt1OG1JaVk1dHlHMFQxVUpRcXBMbVR1WXdHVWgzdG5jTnY0amo2Y1FIV0hpeDdod0hZODl1MDdueVR6TkwyUjVXelpGUS12LWFuaUgzYlJ5UHkwRDg3azhGUHdhQkowdw</guid></item><item><title>Repurposed Blood Pressure Drug May Treat ADHD - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZkFVX3lxTE9jeS1xOXQ4U2hwM09tUXY0WHZvcWFCbkxTNGxOTnlJYm91SzdEVzJWVkZidVRQOTdCLVQ2RW5JcS1pQU1GdFN4N1V0QXlnMDZidlN0c2x6WnROanBPZlplVXNZYW5JQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study suggests that amlodipine, a widely used blood pressure medication, could help manage ADHD symptoms. Researchers tested five potential drugs in rats bred for ADHD-like behaviors, and only amlodipine significantly reduced hyperactivity. Follow-up studies in zebrafish showed that the drug also decreased impulsivity, confirming its effect on ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis revealed that amlodipine crosses the blood-brain barrier and targets calcium channels linked to ADHD. A review of patient data also found that individuals taking amlodipine reported fewer mood swings and reduced risk-taking behaviors. Given its established safety profile, amlodipine could offer a faster, safer alternative to current ADHD treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crosses the Blood-Brain Barrier:&lt;/strong&gt; Amlodipine was shown for the first time to enter the brain and influence ADHD-related pathways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targets ADHD-Linked Calcium Channels:&lt;/strong&gt; Genetic analysis linked ADHD to the same calcium channels affected by amlodipine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Safer Alternative:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike current ADHD medications, amlodipine is widely used, well-tolerated, and less likely to cause severe side effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Surrey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repurposing amlodipine, a commonly used blood pressure medicine, could help manage attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, according to an international study involving the University of Surrey. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in &lt;em&gt;Neuropsychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt;, researchers tested five potential drugs in rats bred to exhibit ADHD-like symptoms. Among them, only amlodipine, a common blood pressure medication, significantly reduced hyperactivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107915"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/neuropharmacology-adhd-drug-repurposing-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/neuropharmacology-adhd-drug-repurposing-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/neuropharmacology-adhd-drug-repurposing-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/neuropharmacology-adhd-drug-repurposing-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/neuropharmacology-adhd-drug-repurposing-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/neuropharmacology-adhd-drug-repurposing-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/neuropharmacology-adhd-drug-repurposing-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/neuropharmacology-adhd-drug-repurposing-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows pills." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/neuropharmacology-adhd-drug-repurposing-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/neuropharmacology-adhd-drug-repurposing-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/neuropharmacology-adhd-drug-repurposing-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/neuropharmacology-adhd-drug-repurposing-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/neuropharmacology-adhd-drug-repurposing-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/neuropharmacology-adhd-drug-repurposing-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/neuropharmacology-adhd-drug-repurposing-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Current ADHD medications are effective but come with significant side effects: from appetite loss, high blood pressure, headaches and sleep disturbance and carry a risk of misuse. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To confirm its effects the team tested amlodipine in zebrafish, an important model for studying brain function sharing about 70% of genes with humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that amlodipine also reduced hyperactivity and impulsivity—core symptoms of ADHD—in these fish. Further analysis of the fish revealed that amlodipine crosses the blood-brain barrier for the first time, meaning it can directly influence brain function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then turned to human genetic data and found that, remarkably, ADHD is linked to the same calcium channels in the brain as the targets for amlodipine. This suggests a potential target brain pathway for treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, an analysis of UK-wide patient data showed that people taking amlodipine reported fewer mood swings and less risk-taking behaviour, further supporting its potential as a new ADHD treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Matthew Parker, co-author of the study from the University of Surrey, said: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Repurposing amlodipine, a well-established blood pressure medication, offers a promising and swift pathway to address ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research indicates that, due to its existing approval and safety profile, amlodipine could be rapidly redeployed as a treatment option for ADHD, potentially providing relief to patients sooner than developing new medications.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current ADHD medications are effective but come with significant side effects: from appetite loss, high blood pressure, headaches and sleep disturbance and carry a risk of misuse. Amlodipine, which is already widely used and well-tolerated, could offer a new, safer treatment option for ADHD.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 25% of patients do not respond well to any current ADHD medication, highlighting the urgent need for new treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuropsychopharmacology and ADHD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d4b9b6e4e5e6e394a7a1a6a6b1adfab5b7faa1bf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Melanie Battolla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://surrey.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Surrey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Melanie Battolla – University of Surrey&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41386-025-02062-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Validation of L-type calcium channel blocker amlodipine as a novel ADHD treatment through cross-species analysis, drug-target Mendelian randomization, and clinical evidence from medical&lt;/a&gt;” by Matthew Parker et al. &lt;em&gt;Neuropsychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Validation of L-type calcium channel blocker amlodipine as a novel ADHD treatment through cross-species analysis, drug-target Mendelian randomization, and clinical evidence from medical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder that significantly affects life outcomes, and current treatments often have adverse side effects, high abuse potential, and a 25% non-response rate, highlighting the need for new therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study investigates amlodipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, as a potential foundation for developing a novel ADHD treatment by integrating findings from animal models and human genetic data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amlodipine reduced hyperactivity in SHR rats and decreased both hyperactivity and impulsivity in &lt;em&gt;adgrl3.1&lt;/em&gt;−/− zebrafish. It also crosses the blood-brain barrier, reducing telencephalic activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, Mendelian Randomization analysis linked ADHD to genetic variations in L-type calcium channel subunits (α1-C; CACNA1C, β1; CACNB1, α2δ3; CACNA2D3) targeted by amlodipine, while polygenic risk score analysis showed symptom mitigation in individuals with high ADHD genetic liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its well-tolerated profile and efficacy across species, supported by genetic evidence, amlodipine shows potential to be refined and developed into a novel treatment for ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 13:55:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE9jeS1xOXQ4U2hwM09tUXY0WHZvcWFCbkxTNGxOTnlJYm91SzdEVzJWVkZidVRQOTdCLVQ2RW5JcS1pQU1GdFN4N1V0QXlnMDZidlN0c2x6WnROanBPZlplVXNZYW5JQQ</guid></item><item><title>Scientists just discovered a key connection between face processing and intelligence - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxOVFJvdzkxYTJpc3cwQ2ZsWURRZWRnakl6MG1zR1pnc0R3V0ZHS3FEN3E0Zm12MDVqOVk1Mk5ySmdicFNhQW9DcHJjbmFVbS1QYnpRaV9OcTFWOHlmZGVDMXFzX1NDMGdyQWxZaEhRbjJ0aWI5Rmtya3lIRzJkLWdROVpuc2U4MHNrRHhLY3FpOXJLR1k0QzF1c1h6ZDBsekdJQTk2Ug?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p class="ng-star-inserted"&gt;&lt;span class="ng-star-inserted"&gt;New research has revealed that the ability to process faces is not only connected to general intelligence but is also negatively associated with certain traits linked to autism. The study, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/17470218251323388" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ng-star-inserted"&gt;, found that individuals who performed well on face processing tasks also tended to score higher on intelligence tests. Conversely, those who reported more difficulties with nonverbal communication, a trait sometimes associated with autism, showed poorer face processing skills.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Faces are such a critical part of our day-to-day lives, and most people don’t think about their face perception abilities,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dana-Walker-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dana L. Walker&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Western Australia. “There is a lot of information we extract from the face, such as someone’s identity, emotional state, trustworthiness, and so on. But research is still needed to fully understand how we perceive faces, and especially how our ability to perceive faces relates to other aspects of our personality and cognition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, the researchers recruited 253 participants from the general community through the TestableMinds platform. To ensure a relatively homogenous sample and minimize confounding variables, they established specific inclusion criteria. Participants had to be between 18 and 49 years old to ensure cognitive abilities are relatively stable. Residence in Australia, USA, UK, New Zealand, Canada, or Ireland was required due to shared linguistic and cultural similarities. The researchers also required participants to have English as their first language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon recruitment, the participants completed a battery of tests designed to measure different aspects of face processing abilities, cognitive abilities, and trait autism. Four tests were administered to assess different components of face processing. The Mooney Face Task measured face detection ability. The Cambridge Face Perception Test (CFPT) assessed the ability to discriminate or individualize faces from each other. The Cambridge Face Memory Test (CFMT) measured the ability to encode a face to memory and recall that face at a later time. The emotion labelling task evaluated the ability to accurately identify facial expressions related to emotion. The Cambridge Car Memory Test (CCMT) was also administered to serve as a non-face comparison for the CFMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure the cognitive abilities of the participants, the researchers employed four tests designed to assess different aspects of intelligence. The Concrete and Abstract Words Synonym Test measured crystallized intelligence, a measure of accumulated knowledge and verbal skills. The paper folding test assessed visuospatial ability, involving the ability to visualize and mentally manipulate shapes and objects. The visual working memory test measured an individual’s memory span, the ability to hold and manipulate information in their mind. The Baddeley’s Semantic Verification Test measured speeded reasoning, specifically the ability to quickly and accurately process information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess traits associated with autism, the researchers used the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), a questionnaire to measure the dimensions of autism: deficits in communication, poor social skills, and attention to detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers confirmed the existence of a general face processing ability factor (f). This means that individuals who perform well on one type of face processing task (such as recognizing emotions) tend to perform well on other face processing tasks as well (such as remembering faces). This factor suggests that there is an underlying general ability related to how our brains process faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the study found a moderate, positive association between this general face processing ability factor (f) and general intelligence (g). This suggests that individuals with higher cognitive abilities tend to be better at processing faces. This association lends support to the idea that face processing could be considered a cognitive ability that is related to general intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, and perhaps most notably, the study revealed that difficulties in nonverbal communication, a trait often associated with autism, were negatively associated with the general face processing ability factor (f). This indicates that individuals who struggle with nonverbal communication tend to have poorer face processing abilities. This negative association remained even when the researchers took overall intelligence into account, which suggests that these communication difficulties may be an independent factor affecting how people process faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, face perception and face memory were found to uniquely predict expression recognition ability. It was found that face detection, face perception, and face memory have a relationship where face detection predicted face perception, face perception predicted face memory, and face memory predicted expression recognition ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not everyone finds it easy to extract information from faces about someone’s identity and emotional state,” Walker told PsyPost. “There are varying degrees of face perception ability ranging from poor perception of faces to very good perception of faces, and these differences are associated with other cognitive abilities and aspects of our personality. By better understanding how these abilities and traits relate to each other, we may be able to develop interventions for those who struggle with face perception.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings provide support for the idea that face processing skills should be considered a broad cognitive ability in their own right, similar to skills such as reasoning or spatial thinking. This opens up the possibility that models of intelligence, which have traditionally focused on areas like memory, speed, and reasoning, might be expanded to include social and perceptual skills such as face processing. The researchers even propose that deficits in face memory—often used as a basis for diagnosing a condition called developmental prosopagnosia—might be viewed through the lens of a learning disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the study was preregistered. In other words, the researchers publicly documented the study’s design, hypotheses, and analysis plan before data collection. This practice helps increase transparency and reduces the risk of researchers unconsciously biasing their findings or selectively reporting results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ongoing, transparent, and rigorous research is important,” Walker explained. “It can help redefine and refine important theoretical and practical areas of psychology. For example, the definition and theoretical structure of intelligence, which has implication for many areas of our lives (such as our education systems), is continuously evolving as more research is conducted. Also, the way we evaluate the diagnosis protocol of clinical prosopagnosia (the inability to recognise faces) needs to be evaluated and refine as we understand more about face recognition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study, like all research, includes limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One caveat is the generalisability of our research,” Walker noted. “We collect data from predominantly Caucasian individuals from Western countries. Therefore, our findings may or may not generalise to different ethnicities and cultures. More research would be needed to replicate our findings in other countries and with different races.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is more we need to understand about face perception, intelligence, and trait-autism. As mentioned, it would be good to replicate these findings in different populations to see how generalizable our findings are. We hope that this research provides the foundation for future research into face perception, intelligence, and trait-autism, especially in the field of developmental psychology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/17470218251323388" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Inter-Association Between Face Processing, Intelligence, and Autistic-like Nonverbal Communication&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Dana Walker, Romina Palermo, and Gilles G.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain circuits are known to gradually form and develop after birth as the result of both innate biological processes and life experiences. Past studies suggest that the initial development of brain circuits spans across two different stages.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The first of these stages takes place before animals and humans start experiencing life. During this stage, the initial organization of cortical networks is established via internal (i.e., endogenous) mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the formation of this initial organization, the second stage begins. This second phase entails the refinement of cortical networks over time in response to an animal or human's individual life experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies (FIAS), Goethe University Frankfurt and the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience recently explored the processes supporting the early development of neural circuits in the mammal brain's visual cortex. Their &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01857-3" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, unveils patterns of cortical activity occurring in the ferret visual cortex before and after newly born pups first open their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The fundamental structure of cortical networks arises early in development before the onset of sensory experience," Sigrid Trägenap, David E. Whitney and their colleagues wrote in their paper. "However, how endogenously generated networks respond to the onset of sensory experience and how they form mature sensory representations with experience remain unclear. We examined this 'nature–nurture transform' at the single-trial level using chronic in vivo calcium imaging in ferret visual cortex."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand what happens in the visual cortex of ferrets before and after birth, the researchers used a technique called in vivo calcium imaging. This imaging approach relies on the use of special dyes or genetically encoded proteins that light up when calcium levels increase, which in neurons occurs when they become active.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trägenap, Whitney and their colleagues used calcium imaging to record the activity of neurons in the ferret's visual cortex before ferret pups first opened their eyes, when they first opened their eyes, and a week after they were born. Interestingly, they observed different patterns of activity at these different stages of early development.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"At eye opening, visual stimulation evokes robust patterns of modular cortical network activity that are highly variable within and across trials, severely limiting stimulus discriminability," wrote Trägenap, Whitney and their colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These initial stimulus-evoked modular patterns are distinct from spontaneous network activity patterns present before and at the time of eye opening. Within a week of normal visual experience, cortical networks develop low-dimensional, highly reliable stimulus representations that correspond with reorganized patterns of spontaneous activity."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results of this recent study suggest that activity in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/visual+cortex/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;visual cortex&lt;/a&gt; of ferrets, and potentially other mammals, varies significantly before, during and after birth. Their observations indicate that when a ferret first opens its eyes, its brain struggles to create consistent representations of what the animal first sees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After just a week of life, however, the same ferret's brain activity shifts. They observed stable neural patterns linked to representations of visual stimuli. As part of their study, the researchers also developed a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/computational+model/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;computational model&lt;/a&gt; that they used to artificially replicate the early development processes they observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Using a computational model, we propose that reliable visual representations derive from the alignment of feedforward and recurrent cortical networks shaped by novel patterns of visually driven activity," wrote the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on their findings, Trägenap, Whitney and their colleagues suggest that visual representations emerge as the result of two types of cortical networks, one carrying incoming sensory signals (i.e., feedforward) and one refining visual representations via internal processes (i.e., recurrent). Their paper could soon inform further neuroscience studies focusing on early brain development, while also potentially informing the creation of new artificial intelligence (AI) models that emulate the dynamics they observed.&lt;/p&gt;

But with vapes, you just keep going and it’s much harder to know how many puffs you’ve had. It’s much easier to vape continuously because you can do it in places where smoking might be less acceptable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Shocked by his own findings, he says: “What we have found is the dangers for someone who keeps vaping are no different from smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="BoxStyles_box-container__Qk3WH BoxStyles_non-commercial__aiWwo" data-testid="non-commercial-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;“At the beginning (of the study) I also believed that vaping was more beneficial than smoking. You see a lot more people vaping these days because they don’t think it’s too bad. Many will be horrified to know the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;During the study at the university’s Institute of Sport, participants - aged between 18 to 45, with an average age of 27 and similar levels of fitness and physical activity - were given regular stress tests to measure the elasticity of their blood vessels and the speed of blood flow to their brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;For 12 hours prior to testing, they consumed only water and desisted from vaping, smoking and exercise. According to Dr Boidin, the mediated dilation (FMD) test, in which a cuff is placed on the participant’s arm and inflated to restrict the blood flow, before being released to measure how much the artery expands as more blood is passed through it, produced the starkest results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;We joined the study in its final weeks and saw that smokers and vapers achieved a flat reading, signalling damaged artery walls that can no longer dilate - an almost certain sign of future serious cardiovascular problems. Further tests proved that the blood flow in smokers and vapers is similarly impaired, making them at risk of developing cognitive dysfunction, including dementia, &lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/worlds-first-study-reveals-truth-34719574" target="_self" aria-label="" tabindex="0"&gt;The Mirror reports.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Dr Boidin, senior lecturer in cardiac rehabilitation, believes the damage is due to inflammation caused by nicotine, as well as the metals and chemicals found in vapes, which include propylene glycol, vegetable glycerine. Substances in the chemical flavourings such as carbonyl compound are known to cause inflammation and oxidative stress, which can lead to artery inner wall damage and cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;He says: “When you put this mixture of metals and chemicals into your body you can’t expect nothing to happen.” Vaping use in the UK has exploded since the first electronic cigarettes arrived here in 2005. There are now 5.1million people aged 16 or over in Britain - about one in ten - using vapes, according to figures last year from the Office for National Statistics. Vaping rates were highest among those aged 16 to 24, at 15.8%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;One million people in England now vape, despite never having been regular smokers, a seven-fold increase in three years, according to a University College London study published in The Lancet Public Health Journal. And, despite recent vaping scares, like the death this year of Hollyoaks star Paul Danan, aged 46, who months earlier revealed he’d had to be revived after suffering respiratory failure caused by excessive vaping, Public Health England is still advising that “vaping poses a small fraction of the risks of smoking”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_image-embed__0T8WX false" data-testid="imageembed-31062639"&gt;&lt;figure class="Figure_figure__Uce4f"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/article31062639.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_Daily-Mirror.jpg" loading="lazy" srcset="https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/article31062639.ece/ALTERNATES/s458b/2_Daily-Mirror.jpg 458w, https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/article31062639.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_Daily-Mirror.jpg 615w,

I think doctors should be able to prescribe vapes for a certain time, so they could be used as a transition tool, but only for a short time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;“We now know the long-term effects of vaping, and if we don’t act now we will see a health emergency in the next ten, 15 years.” Rachael Maskell, &lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/labour-party" target="" aria-label="" tabindex="0"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt; MP for York Central who has called for tighter restrictions on vapes, says: “This study adds to the body of evidence that vaping can cause significant harm to a person. The government should take stricter measures in ensuring that vapes are only accessible to people who currently smoke as a smoking cessation intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;But Dr Marina Murphy, scientific spokesperson for the UK Vaping Industry Association, dismisses the study’s findings, saying: “Millions of people have been using vaping products safely for many years.

Life Time, Inc. — which is where a decent chunk of Drews’s money is going these days — has launched a “performance and longevity” subscription program that includes doctors inside its fitness clubs that can prescribe GLP-1 drugs when appropriate, metabolic blood testing, meetings with a dietician, and access to personal trainers. It focuses the importance of a long-term, 360 degree view of health and wellness that begins for many people when losing weight on the medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="DHVO76DIH5GKZDZZJM7WRQUNMM" data-apitype="header" level="1" id="DHVO76DIH5GKZDZZJM7WRQUNMM"&gt;Winners and losers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2KCCZOL4XZGSZIFNU7DW5LMUGA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A Midwesterner born and raised, Drews taught himself computer programming and worked for manufacturing companies in the steel industry before pivoting to law school. He had a lot of success in his new career, but the high-stress job working 16-hour days six days a week did not leave a lot of room to focus on his health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XW5SBPEAFREIBJEROI4KRWQPRA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At 63 and standing 5-foot-11, he hit 287 pounds and was told by his doctor that he was “pre,” or borderline, for a lot of health conditions, including hypertension and diabetes. He had also become frustrated he was missing out on hiking and other activities with his four grown kids, who were then 27 to 34, because he became tired and out of breath so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XASCSIUF5VFTHCQOU7UN6F6XQI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Drews’s transformation began pretty quickly after he started on a GLP-1 drug. He lost the first couple dozen of pounds on Ozempic (he later switched to Mounjaro, which is considered more potent because&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;it targets two hormones rather than one) without much effort, mostly due to being less hungry, and what he describes as sporadic exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WKO6PJXKOZE6FA6CZKAKAKAZ3Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At his annual checkup a year later, Drews’s doctor reiterated concerns about muscle loss and lectured him about increasing his fitness activity. This time, Drews was all in. A lot of the money he saved on food went into paying for a personal trainer — at $140 an hour, twice a week — who put together a comprehensive plan that included a strength coach, cardio coach, Pilates class for stability, pool time and more. These days, he’s up at 4:30 a.m. and at the Life Time in Burr Ridge, Ill. near his home shortly afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VNDOIII3VVD2ZN2LI2QUXUHUIA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;His eating habits completely changed, too. It wasn’t exactly a decision, he says. It was almost instinctive. He had zero interest in food and often forgot to eat, a common experience among GLP-1 users who have reported on social media and to doctors that what they call “food noise” is gone, with some saying they even feel ill at the thought of eating Hostess cupcakes, Doritos or other ultra-processed food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JJFJTJKB5FD7LNLQOJX2Q4OME4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I’d eat a handful of peanut M&amp;amp;M’s at night for no good reason. Now, I can’t imagine doing that. It’s hard for me to even remember what I was eating it’s been that long,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y3BWQZRYRZEXXKGUKPBKKOLJMM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Drews’s eating became more deliberate and about putting the right kinds of calories into his body rather than enjoyment or whimsy. A typical breakfast is three eggs, a half-cup of egg whites along with overnight oats and blueberries and half a banana. For lunch, ground venison or ground bison and vegetables. Dinner: salmon, sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts and broccoli. Snacks are a combo of yogurt, raspberries, cacao nibs, and honey or walnuts, peanuts and macadamia nuts, and for drinks: exclusively water, coffee and matcha. He mostly eats at home despite his family teasing him that he’s become “an antisocial eater.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LZAFYNTO2NFCJFSEFQIBJ2VHNM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He has heard that some food companies have created new products optimized for GLP-1, but he has not tried them and does not intend to for now. Nestlé is betting on meal and nutrient replacements for those eating less. CookUnity and Daily Harvest, meal delivery companies, have created GLP-1 “companion” lines focused on smaller but calorie- and protein-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F2RTRJINOJDCNH5VVEOMFYLSYY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Drews is what consumer marketers might describe as a “premium purchaser” who might reallocate the money spent on total consumption to higher-quality foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZTJZ3PY4RFHSHEXVVNS4IFI4IQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Why not buy filet mignon when you only have the appetite for a few ounces of steak?” KPMG’s Andrew Lindsay, the company’s top consumer and retail strategy analyst, wrote in a recent report about GLP-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BFUWYI7SDJCNZOQIYPAMRMBAUY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;An analysis by research firm Grocery Doppio shows plenty of ups as well as downs in food spending nationally, with sales of lean meats increasing 27 percent in the first half of 2024 compared with the same period in 2023, while sales of whole fruits and vegetables were up 13 percent. Sales of snacks and confectionary purchases,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;which include chocolate, candy and sugar-coated treats, were down 52 percent, while prepared baked good sales tumbled 47 percent. Gaurav Pant, chief insights officer for Grocery Doppio, said that while the company initially saw grocery basket sizes fall, they jumped back up as shoppers shifted toward higher-quality foods — such as organic produce and premium protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WF3ZEI2QJFDXXI4VKA34VWS624" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We believe that a decent portion of GLP-1 users may actually increase their grocery food spending over time,” Pant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XN2QVNVD3FEJVFR4P5OLSA3FNI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Drews calculates his spending on food is more than it was in the past. His biggest-ticket items are venison and bison, high-protein, lean red meat he is having flown in from Hawaii following a recommendation from a friend. “It’s super high in nutrients, raised on grass grown on lava from Maui,” he said. It runs $31 a pound vs. about $5 a pound for ground beef at a grocery store. He eats it every day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OPJDHUOGANETPOUCO4AN4VXBDM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;By June 1, 2023, he had 14.5 percent body fat. (He’s now at 10.5 percent.) The average American man has 28.1 percent. He was thrilled with the results and went into maintenance mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YO7YFYIPWJECBOJ74AGV6QUCJ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I’ve been heavy my whole life,” he said. “I’ve never had six pack abs before. I can’t have enough mirrors in my house. How vain is that?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="46TIV6EKW5CSLERY6GET7ZXAXA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The changes in his weight led to changes in his clothing. When he began to work out every day, he noticed that the baggy T-shirts and shorts from Dick’s Sporting Goods weren’t cutting it and, during a trip to the mall, walked into Lululemon for the first time. With the frequency of his workouts, he said, and “in all honesty, emerging muscles,” he wanted clothes that were more durable, fitted and stylish. He dropped hundreds of dollars on workout-wear basics and kept coming back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MS6Q7DOKPFBSLKFGEEWSF2AZAA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While his taste in dress shirts and suits for court didn’t change — he still favored Nordstrom’s selection — he needed to buy the same or similar clothes in new sizes three times as his body shrank, losing 2½ inches in his neck and eight inches in his waist. He went from XXL down to XL, then large and, most recently, medium, which he says is as small as he will go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WGDA3IGRKJBTZDL6NLZ4QWVRJU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Recently, Drews was reading a lot of books — such as Herman Pontzer’s “Burn” — about health, activity, longevity and modern medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DDUTDNIDFFHEJNDF5SWLWTDWBI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Pontzer is an evolutionary anthropologist at Duke University and, for about 15 years, has been measuring metabolisms of all kinds of people: ultra-athletes, office workers, members of the Hadza tribe in Tanzania, who still hunt and gather their food. Pontzer found that despite how active the Hadza are, they burn the same amount of calories as more sedentary people in industrialized countries, meaning that efforts to “boost” metabolism in the past through being more active were probably in vain. Drews is intrigued by “the thought of the GLP-1 drugs changing the course of our evolutionary predispositions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7CZ6L7EYZRGQNHT6BGNDSBJGH4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On a vacation with one of his sons in September, the two went to the U.S. Southwest. In the past, he probably would&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;have argued for an all-inclusive resort in Mexico, the Dominican Republic or Florida, where the farthest he might walk is from his hotel room to the water and “doing what all the people do there, which is misbehave.” Or maybe some place in Europe where the focus would be on eating and drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MRFPCOZ4XVHFBAXZLQK55Q7EN4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This time, he agreed to an adventure through national parks: Grand Canyon, Bryce, Zion.

                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-05.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Data&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows this flu season is the most severe since the 2009 swine flu, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flu-levels-highest-since-2009-pandemic-cdc-reports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reported CBS News&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span class="fw-bold"&gt;Dr. Angela Rasmussen&lt;/span&gt;, a virologist and professor at the University of Saskatchewan, told &lt;a href="https://mynorthwest.com/gee-and-ursula" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;“The Gee and Ursula Show”&lt;/a&gt; on KIRO Newsradio that fewer people have gotten the flu vaccine this season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is the flu spreading?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="h2"&gt;Part of that, Rasmussen said, is due to the CDC stopping a flu vaccination campaign. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;According to NPR&lt;/a&gt;, the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases told CDC staff the campaign would not continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any time that we’re discouraging vaccination, it’s never a good thing, because ultimately what that does, is that it decreases the number of people who are actually going to go get a flu vaccine and the whole reason for that campaign was to educate people on the fact that vaccines can prevent the surge in flu cases — in serious flu cases or even deaths that we’re seeing right now — not only in Washington state, but throughout the U.S.,” Rasmussen explained. “So flu is a seasonal disease. It is something that can cause severe illness, but vaccines have been known for decades to actually reduce the likelihood that you end up in the hospital, certainly reduce the likelihood that you end up in the morgue, and it’s always going to have really negative, harmful effects when fewer people take those vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also believes the political effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to fewer people getting vaccinated, adding vaccines don’t always prevent infections but are meant to prevent serious illness and death.&lt;/p&gt;
                            
                        
&lt;h2&gt;Impacts of health cuts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasmussen then provided insight into how cuts are affecting her colleagues in the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thousands of jobs have been cut from all of those agencies at the CDC, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/eis/php/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Epidemic Intelligence Service&lt;/a&gt; — which is our nation’s essentially disease detectives, they respond to outbreaks and contain them — has been gutted,” she shared. “The laboratory services that support them doing diagnostics has been gutted. The influenza division at CDC, which tracks seasonal flu, has been gutted. The website has been profoundly altered to remove all references to DEI, which actually can change the information that’s there for some diseases such as MPOX and HIV and diseases that affect women’s health, things that affect types of cancer that women get, for example, it can affect diseases that are particularly likely to affect one ethnic group over another. This has really profound effects for the way that we’re even communicating about some of the health risks to the American people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Virologist says bird flu is ‘out of control’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching topics Gee Scott, host of “Gee and Ursula” asked about bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which Rasmussen replied, “is out of control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have thousands of cows, potentially millions of cows, around the country that are infected with this and are secreting extremely high amounts of virus in their milk that has caused a record number of human cases in dairy workers,” she shared. “So now we’re up to at least 70 confirmed human cases, as well as probably many more, as well as we have data that suggests there are a lot of cases that are going undetected.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s OK to brush off this advice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One piece of “conventional wisdom” has echoed through households for generations, threatening those just trying to rush out the door — “Don’t go outside with wet hair, otherwise you’ll catch a cold!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/24/health/the-cold-and-flu-must-haves-you-need-to-buy-before-you-get-sick/"&gt;With cold and flu season well underway&lt;/a&gt;, this &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/09/29/myth-busted-doctor-reveals-what-really-happens-if-you-swallow-gum/"&gt;old wives’ tale&lt;/a&gt; may be ringing in your ears. But one internal medicine physician puts a damper on the lore, noting that there’s no scientific evidence that stepping out with damp locks on a brisk day will spark the sneezin’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;There’s no scientific evidence that you will catch a cold if you step outside with wet hair. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;SHOTPRIME STUDIO – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The belief that you can catch a cold by going outside with wet hair is a myth,” &lt;a href="https://www.cwclv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Christopher Choi&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified internist in Las Vegas, told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wet hair does not directly have any bearing on catching &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/24/health/the-cold-and-flu-must-haves-you-need-to-buy-before-you-get-sick/"&gt;a cold&lt;/a&gt;,” he explained. “A cold is caused by viruses, typically rhinovirus.” &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“Wet hair does not directly have any bearing on catching a cold,” one internist said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;dikushin – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Rhinoviruses are considered the primary cause of the common cold, estimated to be responsible for 50% to 70% of cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The two primary modes of transmission for rhinoviruses, according to Choi, are “coming into contact with individuals infected with a cold who coughs and the other individual inhales the droplet, or by touching a surface infected with virus, which can live for hours, and then touching your face.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s one myth busted. But then why is it that — anecdotally — some people are adamant that they do seem to get the sniffles whenever they dismiss this superstition?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Even though wet hair doesn’t directly cause colds, it can potentially contribute to body temperature dropping slightly, which could minimally contribute to catching cold,” Choi shared. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Colds are typically transmitted by breathing in the droplets of an infected person.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Halfpoint – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the biggest culprit is most likely the weather and not your head, especially since “there is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4311828/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/22/health/childhood-respiratory-illnesses/"&gt;rhinovirus&lt;/a&gt; multiplies better in cold weather,” Choi said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Plus, chilly temperatures are likely to weaken your immune system, making you more susceptible to infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And when you’re exposed to cold weather, the blood vessels in your nose constrict.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means you have decreased protection against rhinoviruses because “the typical route of transmission is the nasal passages,” Choi said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to protect yourself from catching a cold&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wash your hands &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Avoid touching your face&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Stay away from sick people &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Stay warm&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s clear how certain habits mentioned above could affect your cognitive health (like wearing a helmet, for example), other factors are a little more nuanced ― but are just as important to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, socialization is a true indicator of brain health. “We are social beings ... and there are even changes in metabolic activity and brain activity that occur when we’re isolated that are harmful,” Ellison said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With isolation comes loneliness, which can put you at higher risk of cognitive decline and stroke, Ellison added. “It’s very important to cultivate a social network,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garg also noted that those with close family and friend connections can also get more support when recovering from health issues, which is important for well-being, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The factors that seem to relate more to heart health, like blood pressure, are important, too. “Almost everything that’s good for the brain is actually also good for the heart,” Ellison said. “When the heart is functioning properly, it provides nutrients and oxygen, which fuel the brain and keep it healthy, and it helps remove toxic metabolites from the brain as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the heart is not functioning properly, the circulation and oxygenation and metabolic care of the brain is compromised, and that can lead to cognitive changes,” Ellison continued. He added that one of the most common kinds of cognitive decline in older people is “vascular cognitive impairment, which is a direct result of compromised circulation in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garg said simple, small positive habits, like diet and exercise, can often bring the biggest health rewards. She recommends a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7833708" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; and said you should talk to your doctor about the best exercise regimen for you, as it varies person to person. Additionally, if you smoke, you should talk to your doctor about quitting, to protect both your brain and your overall health, Garg said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s also important to manage your &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/evelinamedina/which-human-emotion-are-you"&gt;emotions&lt;/a&gt;, and you can talk to your doctor about how to best do that, too. “There are so many different ways to curb anxiety and stress, but people don’t realize how much of an impact it can make on your body and your brain,” Garg said. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7355582/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7833708" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that anxiety is linked to higher rates of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are questions you should bring up throughout your life, not just once you reach a certain age.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Avian flu was detected in a small number of captive birds &lt;a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2025/02/08/bird-flu-magherafelt-nature-reserve-closed-after-influenza-found-in-small-number-of-captive-birds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2025/02/08/bird-flu-magherafelt-nature-reserve-closed-after-influenza-found-in-small-number-of-captive-birds/"&gt;in Magherafelt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/tags/derry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.irishtimes.com/tags/derry/"&gt;Co Derry&lt;/a&gt;, and more than 60,000 birds were due to be slaughtered last week after a suspected case was detected at a poultry operation in Co Tyrone. Given that six cases have also been found in wild birds in the Republic since December, the restrictions are prudent and probably sufficient, though with a highly infectious virus capable of jumping the species barrier, there is never room for complacency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;The Department of Agriculture and public health specialists consider the risk manageable because no other animal species is infected here. But mindful that &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000t47k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000t47k"&gt;flu ignores borders&lt;/a&gt;, there is concern about a high number of cases in the UK and elsewhere – and cases of human infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;Concern has ratcheted up in the US because Type A H5N1 influenza has caused almost 1,600 outbreaks, forcing the cull of millions of birds. It has infected up to 70 people (including one fatality), with little indication its spread is under control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:html-block-f0frCB4hReP77YJ-3-4-0" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0frCB4hReP77YJ-3-4-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:html-block-f0frCB4hReP77YJ-3-4-0" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0frCB4hReP77YJ-3-4-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;Although human symptoms are mild, there are indications of an insufficiently robust collective effort there. This conspires to heighten the risk of mutation that could lead to a pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph b-it-article-body__interstitial-link"&gt;&lt;span&gt;[ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a aria-label="Open related story" class="c-link" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/health/your-wellness/2025/02/21/bird-flu-why-are-outbreaks-happening-and-should-i-be-worried/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Bird flu: Why are outbreaks happening and should I be worried?&lt;span class="visually-hidden"&gt;Opens in new window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;Immunologist Prof Kingston Mills of Trinity College Dublin says  current bird flu strains are low risk to humans, “but the big risk is another mutation that makes it transmissible among humans”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;A “scary” research article published recently showed such a mutation was possible to trigger in a laboratory situation – an exercise in trying to anticipate its virility and ability to transmit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;“There is not much evidence [human to human] is happening now but there is a risk, nevertheless,” he says. “It’s quite tricky to prevent. Every farmworker is not going to wear a mask.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;Covid-19 took hold in such circumstances; notably poor practices in Wuhan food markets where a virus soon became almost impossible to contain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;“That said, there have been remarkably few cases as [human] transmission is obviously not effective,” Mills says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;Cases of seasonal flu in humans are very high this winter but that is a different ball game, he adds – with capacity to easily crank up vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;Bird flu can jump to people who have contact with sick birds and do not take required precautions, says virologist Dr Connor Bamford of Queen’s University Belfast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;“Viruses that predominantly infect birds can – and do – jump into people where they can cause severe disease and even spread to those around you. We have numerous examples of cases of bird flu in people ... so it can happen,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;“If left unchecked and the virus is able to adapt to humans via more spillovers from birds to people occurring, or an outbreak in people happening, this could very well become the next pandemic,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;For several years, the H5N1 virus has been jumping from wild birds into mammals in the US (including cats, bears, raccoons and seals). Last March it was identified in dairy cows for the first time. The jump into an animal with which humans have such close contact is a serious warning sign. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;As for where the next pandemic may emerge, “a lot of the betting money would be on flu”, Mills says – with the most likely route being animal-to-human transmission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;Flu is most likely because it affects so many species, where strains undergo genetic recombination to produce more pathogenic variants as time goes by. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;Scientists have long considered bird flu a leading candidate for causing a human pandemic. Since 2003, it has &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/2021-dha-docs/cumulative-number-of-confirmed-human-cases-for-avian-influenza-a(h5n1)-reported-to-who--2003-2024.pdf" rel=""&gt;infected at least 954 people around the world and killed at least 464&lt;/a&gt;, mostly in people in proximity to infected birds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;While bird flu may be relatively mild in cows, it poses a potentially greater risk to humans. That’s because, unlike birds, mammals like cows have respiratory systems more similar to humans, which could encourage mutations that make spread easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;On whether the US bird flu strain, which is different from that in Europe, could become “a pandemic virus”, Apoorva Mandavilli, science and global health reporter at  the New York Times told the Daily podcast recently this is “low risk right now”. But there is a lack of visibility on collective actions and preparedness, while updates are slow; all because of “President Trump’s dismantling of the public health system” – yet every case is another opportunity to mutate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;Virologists are watching for any sign H5N1 viruses might be adapting to grow better in humans, says Prof Ed Hutchinson of MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research. “This would be an exceptionally unusual event, but to minimise the risk of future influenza pandemics it is crucial that situations like this are carefully monitored.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;Collaboration and clear communication between human and animal health workers is essential. It requires robust surveillance and prevention measures, such as good biosecurity on farms and contact tracing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;Research into transmission patterns and how viruses change to infect different species continues to inform preparedness efforts and identify emerging threats before they become crises, he says. This is complemented by investment in developing diagnostic tests, vaccines and drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;The evolution of a flu virus derived from a highly pathogenic avian influenza strain to one that is adapted to human-to-human spread is one of the most dreaded disease threats humanity faces. Fortunately, this has yet to happen during this persistent H5N1 outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Irish Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 11:56:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxPX0l5SEQyZFh1ZDFENm0zN3EwaVJJdkh0TEI3OXVGc0RsNlJjLWVIMmhxVlAwX3U2WlZLcm1GOVJyaEt3TWVBYjZzZmx3MjlvbURtOXRlVS1VQmdkUm4wY2RrMnhNUGlFVU00RHd2R0J3RmZ0RzV2TV9PeFc5eFFlTGNSczlzTU9aRGNRdzNpOHhzT0FIVktwMUNQTkVKVjZIdmN4Y3RDaWVWSXoyNlFCNldlTFZSOGE0YUE</guid></item><item><title>Cancer expert lists two things people should cut back on which could help prevent certain cancers - UNILAD</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQT2VMUnF5NFp2Y3c3TVVUZzd5aTVNNFY1VXZJbEx2YWxENzlhWmJOekpNWWVQMGpRRWFuU1IwYy0yLVkxeFJiRlQzTzhtVktma1NjTzRldGZNcF9VMFRESFJjM1B4c0ZiakI1TWREdXlYS2ZKSG5vQTJqeXBSN3lDd3BNb3NVRkNaaG93TE9HZlhXeVAycndtaEQtLWJRVFg0eGg2OFhEOGtsZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A cancer expert has listed two things people should try and cut back on which could help prevent certain cancers from developing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1,777,566 new &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/cancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; cases were reported in the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/us-news"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; in 2021, while over 600,000 people died of the disease in the country in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;While &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/science"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have found certain cancers are linked to family genes, there are many &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; precautions you can take every day to ensure you reduced the risk of some cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr Jiri Kubes, a radiation oncologist and cancer expert, has suggested just two dietary adjustments could provide great health impacts, while also having a positive stance on your &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/mental-health"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Cancer cases are at an all-time high (Getty Stock Photo)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr Kubes warned that completing these two health steps won't eliminate cancer, but could prevent numbers in the disease by a whopping 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Some of what drives cancer is outside of our control, such as genetics and age, but diet and lifestyle do play a part," the cancer specialist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Processed meat and alcohol have both been named as carcinogens by the World Health Organisation.

    &lt;p&gt;Gary Webster, the lead claimant who attended the school from 1975 until 1983 and contracted hepatitis C and HIV, has described the sum as “insulting”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Warwick, his fellow classmate, called it “derisory”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group reactivated their legal action in the inquiry’s wake because of how the school handled the report’s findings in May 2024, as well as the significant harm they were subjected to more than 40 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I personally, and the group, believe that Treloar’s are partially responsible for this tragedy, and they should be held to account,” Mr Webster told The Telegraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over the years, they’ve just ignored us – not apologised, not even been really willing to discuss it. We feel blanked by Treloar’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Des Collins, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Treloar’s victims, said his clients are adamant about going ahead with the legal process. They are seeking recognition of the harm they suffered, compensation for the victims and justice for the boys no longer here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;‘We were groomed’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Collins is 60 per cent certain that Jeremy Cook, the case’s senior master, will move forward with the GLO, he told The Telegraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that there is no legal precedent in the UK to compare the case to, with the most recent comparison being Nazi concentration camps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a case like this, where you’ve got systematic mistreatment of pupils in a school, there are no precedents for it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you want to find systematic treatment of that nature then you’ve actually got to go back to World War Two and something in the concentration camps. It was a deliberate act to use these guys as human guinea pigs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Webster, who now lives not far from Treloar’s in Hampshire, agreed with the comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We all met in the little sick bay room and then needles were stuck into us, taking armfuls of blood and filling us full of factor eight and factor nine,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It reminds you of Mengele and the Nuremberg trials and all this sort of thing. It’s awful. It’s abuse. I think we were groomed.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Earlier, more reliable &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; detection means better post-diagnosis support and more opportunity to understand how it gets started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the UK and Slovenia have now found specific brain activity and breathing patterns can act as signs of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="152858" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team set out to study how oxygenation of the brain might be linked to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-find-common-link-between-distinct-neurodegenerative-diseases"&gt;neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt;, comparing measures of brain oxygenation, heart rate, brain waves, and breathing effort of 19 Alzheimer's patients to 20 people without Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their analysis found differences in neurons linked to blood vessels and in how blood oxygen levels fluctuated as neurons fired. The sync of blood flow and brain activity seems to be noticeably disrupted in Alzheimer's brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152861" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152861" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/GraphicalAbstract.jpg" alt=" Breathing abstract" class="wp-image-152861 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/GraphicalAbstract.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/GraphicalAbstract-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/GraphicalAbstract-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152861" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers linked brain and breathing changes to Alzheimer's. (Bjerkan et al., &lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, there was an unexpected extra: the Alzheimer's patients had a higher &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_rate"&gt;breathing rate&lt;/a&gt; than the control patients, around 17 breaths per minute compared to 13 breaths per minute. This is possibly a result of changes in how blood vessels in the brain connect with deeper nerve tissues to provide a generous supply of oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is an interesting discovery – in my opinion a revolutionary one – that may open a whole new world in the study of Alzheimer's disease," &lt;a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sci-tech/about-us/news/a-new-approach-to-detecting-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biophysicist Aneta Stefanovska, from Lancaster University in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It most likely reflects an inflammation, maybe in the brain, that once detected can probably be treated and severe states of Alzheimer's might be prevented in the future."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setup for the analysis involves a variety of electrical and optical sensors on the scalp – but it doesn't require any blood or tissue samples, and is cheaper and quicker than a lot of other diagnosis options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while breathing patterns on their own wouldn't yet be enough to detect Alzheimer's, with so many other variables in play, researchers can now look at respiratory rates in future studies to build up a more complete picture of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-can-strike-as-young-as-30-these-are-the-signs-to-watch-for"&gt;Alzheimer's symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This supports &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0925443915003701"&gt;the hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; that Alzheimer's disease is triggered by a breakdown in the functioning of the brain's vascular system, which reduces the efficiency of oxygen flow and clearance of toxic materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The vascular system and the brain work together to ensure that the brain receives sufficient energy," &lt;a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sci-tech/about-us/news/a-new-approach-to-detecting-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Bernard Meglič, from the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In fact, the brain needs as much as 20 percent of the body's overall energy consumption despite contributing only about 2 percent of the body's weight."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's much to consider with Alzheimer's – from symptoms to risk factors – that it's likely that a combination of causes are working in combination, but research like this helps get us closer to understanding &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/radical-study-proposes-a-single-cause-to-explain-alzheimers-disease"&gt;the disease's progression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We show clear results of our approach and how Alzheimer's can be detected simply, noninvasively, and inexpensively," &lt;a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sci-tech/about-us/news/a-new-approach-to-detecting-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Stefanovska.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The method has great potential, and we are discussing possibilities to create a spin-out or start-up company to proceed with it. Of course, more research is needed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article/7/1/fcaf007/7994547"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Protein is core to building muscle and, even more so, maintaining it, Klingbeil says. The National Academy of Sciences recommends that adults eat 0.36 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day. But an &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12603-019-1174-1" target="_blank"&gt;analysis of data&lt;/a&gt; from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that 42 percent of men and 50 percent of women over age 70 don’t get that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some experts recommend even more protein for older adults to compensate for muscle loss and the fact that building new muscle becomes harder with age, Klingbeil says. Aim for 0.45 to 0.59 gram per pound per day—that’s 72 to 94 grams for a 160-pound person. (But if you have kidney disease, check with your doctor about your protein intake because too much can tax your kidneys.) Dietitians generally recommend spreading protein throughout the day because that may help your body absorb it better, but Klingbeil says that getting enough is the most important thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/nutrition-healthy-eating/the-truth-about-protein-drinks-a4199144682/"&gt;source of protein&lt;/a&gt; isn’t super-important for building muscle, says Travis Masterson, PhD, the Broadhurst Career Development Professor for the Study of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention at Pennsylvania State University in University Park. &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-eating/how-red-meat-can-fit-into-a-healthy-diet-a3360518260/"&gt;Animal foods&lt;/a&gt; tend to have more per serving than plant sources. But for other aspects of your health, it’s best to get at least some of your protein from plants, such as beans, nuts, and tofu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plant-based diet that includes mostly whole foods is good for your heart and brain, and it lowers your risk of certain cancers. “It also appears to be gentler on the kidneys than a diet high in animal protein as we age,” says Judy Lester, MS, a clinical dietitian at the University of North Carolina Health Care System in Chapel Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 20 grams of protein in a cup of tofu; about 18 grams in a cup of lentils, white beans, or edamame; 8 grams in a cup of quinoa or whole-wheat pasta; and 7 grams in an ounce of peanuts. Beef, salmon, and chicken breast have about 24 grams in 3 ounces. A 5.5-ounce serving of plain nonfat &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/yogurt/healthy-yogurts-that-taste-great-too-a1114386696/"&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; has 16 grams, a cup of low-fat milk has about 9 grams, and an egg has 6 grams.&lt;/p&gt;

Continue reading to know more…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is it turning into a rising concern?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blaming it on hectic lifestyle, unhealthy eating habits or obesity, Fatty liver disease has been a growing concern in which excess fat and sugar accumulates around the liver, leading to inflammation and potential liver damage. Among the natural remedies suggested for liver health, combining turmeric and black coffee has gained interest. Both of these substances are known for their health benefits, especially when it comes to reducing liver inflammation and supporting overall liver function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why turmeric?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;turmeric has the active ingredient curcumin, which is a very powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. Curcumin is the one that reduces inflammation of the liver, the central component of fatty liver disease. turmeric can be helpful for the upkeep of liver function as well as preventing further accumulation of fat in liver cells by suppressing oxidative stress as well as optimizing body cleansing processes naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can black coffee correct liver function&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black coffee contains antioxidants and chemicals such as caffeine and chlorogenic acid, which possess the potential to stimulate liver function. Studies have proven that daily consumption of coffee could lower the risk of liver diseases, including fatty liver. coffee stabilizes liver enzymes, minimizes inflammation, and enhances liver detoxification. coffee has also been associated with lower levels of liver fat, which could be pivotal in fatty liver patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens if you mix turmeric and coffee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining turmeric and black coffee could give more liver health benefits. turmeric and coffee both contain antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds, and combined, their activities could be enhanced by each other. turmeric reduces inflammation of the liver and coffee could reduce liver fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The caffeine in coffee could boost metabolic rate, which would also benefit breakdown of fats in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to add turmeric in Black coffee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To include turmeric in your black coffee, you simply add a pinch of ground turmeric to your already brewed coffee. You may also enhance the absorption by adding a pinch of black pepper, which is rich in piperine—a substance that enhances the bioavailability of curcumin. If you prefer a creamier one, you may create a turmeric latte by adding turmeric, milk, and a pinch of black pepper to your coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: Both coffee and turmeric must be had in reasonable amounts because excess intake of caffeine results in side effects such as jitteriness, and excess intake of turmeric results in stomach problems in some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Scientists develop pine cone-inspired technology with revolutionary capabilities — here's how it could transform future buildings - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxQbFhsYWpHdUdvWGFkZFdlVk91WHpaVjVBUHRWcURfN2tBN1VvWDZhZXlETTJhbGZ2LWVZRHN2UVdmUVNNRFNrVVEtaWZvZUltSjF0SWFxZGpwZ3VnMlhoTV95VnQ0dEtsNlNQNHZGYkdUR25lSndSU0VLNE1wcWswa2VCcnpLZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers have developed an innovative self-adjusting shading system inspired by a surprising natural feature: pine cones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2025-01-adjusting-mimics-cones-energy-autonomous.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt; by the University of Stuttgart on Tech Xplore, scientists at the university and the University of Freiburg have created an energy-autonomous system that passively adapts to the weather. Inspired by the movement mechanisms of pine cones, the researchers developed the Solar Gate, a weather-responsive architectural facade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Thanks to the biomaterial used to build the structure and the advanced computational design, the Solar Gate opens and closes in response to humidity and temperature changes. The best part? It does so without consuming any metabolic energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As a result, the Solar Gate is the "first weather-responsive, adaptive shading system that operates without electrical energy," the post on Tech Xplore &lt;a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2025-01-adjusting-mimics-cones-energy-autonomous.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wrote;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To construct the shading system, the scientists used cellulose, a natural, renewable material that contracts and constricts according to humidity changes. This opening and closing mechanism is found in pine cones, which utilize this capability for seed dispersal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After over a year of testing, the Solar Gate was installed on the livMatS Biomimetic Shell, a research building at the University of Freiburg. During the summer, the Solar Gate closes its elements to minimize solar heat, and during the winter, it opens to maximize natural heating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The Solar Gate thus represents an energy-autonomous and resource-efficient alternative to conventional shading systems," the post on Tech Xplore &lt;a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2025-01-adjusting-mimics-cones-energy-autonomous.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wrote;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. "As buildings account for a significant proportion of global carbon emissions due to the typically high energy needed to maintain indoor comfort, reducing the energy required for heating, cooling and ventilation is of high importance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;By transitioning toward energy-efficient systems such as the Solar Gate, buildings can reduce their environmental footprints and utility bills. Less pollution means fewer harmful gases exacerbating the climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Moving forward, the Solar Gate offers a potential blueprint for companies looking to implement cost-effective heating and cooling systems that utilize renewable materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tech-newsletter/?reck92rbfxCnTOZnS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for weekly updates on the latest innovations &lt;strong&gt;improving our lives&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;shaping our future&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 10:15:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQbFhsYWpHdUdvWGFkZFdlVk91WHpaVjVBUHRWcURfN2tBN1VvWDZhZXlETTJhbGZ2LWVZRHN2UVdmUVNNRFNrVVEtaWZvZUltSjF0SWFxZGpwZ3VnMlhoTV95VnQ0dEtsNlNQNHZGYkdUR25lSndSU0VLNE1wcWswa2VCcnpLZw</guid></item><item><title>Yale doctor's use of ‘cancer vaccine' makes waves after early trials show promising results - CT Insider</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxOR1haSWVJb2hGek1Nb0dUSC1CclZwd3BCWnJGMDBhS2JqZERRVEVvcTB0cThNcXNkRTk4S0FIaEZFZEtsQlA2STZycjgtQW9FVll6WDBuckhnaGZEVnp4QWVIMnFHUlVPa3RZZF90dmJ5WE0xTmdlcmtVOEkyUkNuTDdJcmw1WlBTcWRsLWZlc0xoaXRTU3U4bllzMDlWN0J0WXJz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;It's barely been two years since &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-groundbreaking-year-ago-chatgpt-ushered-in-an-ai-era-how-has-it-impacted-society"&gt;OpenAI's ChatGPT was released&lt;/a&gt; for public use, inviting anyone on the internet to collaborate with an artificial mind on anything from poetry to school assignments to letters to their landlord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the famous &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model"&gt;large language model&lt;/a&gt; (LLM) is just one of several leading programs that appear convincingly human in their responses to basic queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That uncanny resemblance may extend further than intended, with researchers from Israel now finding LLMs suffer a form of cognitive impairment &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-training-may-not-work-but-there-is-a-way-to-boost-your-cognition"&gt;similar to decline in humans&lt;/a&gt;, one that is more severe among earlier models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team applied a battery of cognitive assessments to publicly available 'chatbots': versions 4 and 4o of ChatGPT, two versions of Alphabet's Gemini, and version 3.5 of Anthropic's Claude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were the LLMs truly intelligent, the results would be concerning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their published paper, neurologists Roy Dayan and Benjamin Uliel from Hadassah Medical Center and Gal Koplewitz, a data scientist at Tel Aviv University, &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/387/bmj-2024-081948"&gt;describe&lt;/a&gt; a level of "cognitive decline that seems comparable to neurodegenerative processes in the human brain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of their personality, LLMs have &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00655-z"&gt;more in common&lt;/a&gt; with the predictive text on your phone than the principles that generate knowledge using the squishy grey matter inside our heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this statistical approach to text and image generation gains in speed and personability, it loses in gullibility, building code according to algorithms that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chatgpts-deep-research-is-here-but-can-it-really-replace-a-human-expert"&gt;struggle to sort&lt;/a&gt; meaningful snippets of text from fiction and nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-simple-reason-we-make-the-same-mistakes-over-and-over-even-if-we-know-better"&gt;human brains aren't faultless&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to taking the occasional mental shortcut. Yet with rising expectations of AI delivering trustworthy words of wisdom – even &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chatgpt-can-almost-pass-the-us-medical-licensing-exam"&gt;medical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-23/generative-ai-chatbots-responsible-use-in-court-guildelines/103863968"&gt;legal advice&lt;/a&gt; – comes assumptions that each new generation of LLMs will find better ways to 'think' about what it's actually saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see how far we have to go, Dayan, Uliel, and Koplewitz applied a series of tests that include the &lt;a href="https://mocacognition.com/"&gt;Montreal Cognitive Assessment&lt;/a&gt; (MoCA), a tool neurologists commonly use to measure mental abilities such as memory, spatial skills, and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChaptGPT 4o scored the highest on the assessment, with just 26 out of a possible 30 points, indicating mild cognitive impairment. This was followed by 25 points for ChatGPT 4 and Claude, and a mere 16 for Gemini – a score that would be suggestive of severe impairment in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152265" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152265" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MOCA_scores_642.jpg" alt="graph of AI moca scores" class="wp-image-152265 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MOCA_scores_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MOCA_scores_642-600x340.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152265" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Comparisons of five LLM MoCA scores. (Dayan et al., &lt;em&gt;BMJ&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digging into the results, all of the models performed poorly on visuospatial/executive function measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These included a trail-making task, the copying of a simple cube design, or drawing a clock, with the LLMs either failing completely or requiring explicit instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152266" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152266" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/cubes_ai_642.jpg" alt="attempts at drawing a necker cube" class="wp-image-152266 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/cubes_ai_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/cubes_ai_642-473x415.jpg 473w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/cubes_ai_642-600x526.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152266" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Attempts to draw a Necker cube (top left) by a human (top right) and ChatGPT versions 4 (bottom left) and 4o (bottom right). (Dayan et al., &lt;em&gt;BMJ&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some responses to questions on the subject's location in space echoed those used by dementia patients, such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2024-081948"&gt;Claude's reply of&lt;/a&gt; "the specific place and city would depend on where you, the user, are located at the moment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a lack of empathy shown by all models in a feature of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination could be interpreted as a sign of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/unexpected-protein-linked-to-early-onset-dementia-in-huge-discovery"&gt;frontotemporal dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As might be expected, earlier versions of LLMs scored lower on the tests than more recent models, indicating each new generation of AI has found ways to overcome the cognitive shortcomings of its predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors acknowledge LLMs aren't human brains, making it impossible to 'diagnose' the models tested with any form of dementia. Yet the tests also challenge &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/googles-new-chatbot-passed-the-us-medical-exam-but-only-just"&gt;assumptions that we're on the verge&lt;/a&gt; of an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-huge-amount-of-doctors-are-already-using-ai-in-medical-care"&gt;AI revolution in clinical medicine&lt;/a&gt;, a field that often relies on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ai-identifies-brain-signals-associated-with-recovering-from-depression"&gt;interpreting complex visual scenes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the pace of innovation in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-intelligence" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73092" data-postid="152256" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; continues to accelerate, it's possible, even likely we'll see the first LLM score top marks on cognitive assessment tasks in future decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, the advice of even the most advanced chatbots ought to be treated with a healthy dose of skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2024-081948"&gt;BMJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has spread many detestable theories in his life, but none is more detestable than his scaremongering over autism and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not merely that the new Health and Human Services secretary has convinced thousands of Americans that they’re partially responsible for their children’s autism — a trend he once compared to a “holocaust” — it’s that he’s ensuring thousands more will put their children in needless danger for absolutely no scientific or rational reason.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of Mr. Kennedy’s claims is the lie that Americans have seen a huge spike in autism cases over the past 40 years. Autism rates, Mr. Kennedy said during his congressional hearings, “have gone from 1 in 10,000 [in 1980] … and today in our children, it’s one in 34.” Mr. Kennedy repeated this statistic during his swearing ceremony. “Who can believe that?” he added. “There’s something wrong. There’s something wrong, and I think it’s something that can be found out.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;President Trump repeated this statistic on Truth Social and in his executive order instituting the Make America Healthy Again Commission.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where the one in 10,000 number came from, however, is a mystery. Even in 1966, when autism was diagnosed as a child being socially isolated and showing withdrawn behavior, researchers estimated that around one in 2,500 children were autistic. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maybe next Mr. Kennedy will go back to 1943, the year autism was first designated a condition, and only one in 100 million Americans were diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea that anyone had any useful handle on the number of autistic children in the past, much less used the same criterion we do, is preposterous. Autism wasn’t even a separate diagnosis from schizophrenia in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders until 1980, the year Mr. Kennedy said the affliction began rising.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before 1991, the federal government lumped children with autism in with other “intellectual disabilities.” In 1994, the definition of autism included Asperger syndrome and children on the milder end of the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers didn’t start trying to track autism until 2000. It wasn’t until 2006 that the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended screening all children for autism during routine pediatrician visits in the first two years, and many still did not. It wasn’t until 2013 that present guidelines were instituted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even now, there’s no objective test for autism — no blood test — for diagnosis. So, the prevalence of autism has varied greatly between states, which points to different levels of awareness and testing. States like Rhode Island and Maryland have higher percentages than Louisiana and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When Senator Cassidy, who is a physician, implored the HHS nominee to “reassure mothers unequivocally and without qualification” that vaccines do not cause autism, he would not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If the data is there, I will absolutely do that,” Mr. Kennedy responded. “Not only will I do that, but I will apologize for any statements that misled people otherwise.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, he won’t. Because tons of data already exists, and Mr. Kennedy keeps ignoring it, repeating debunked claims and creating fear.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s momentarily set aside the fact that studies have shown autism likely begins in the womb, long before any vaccines are even given to children.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr. Kennedy made his name in the anti-vaccine movement by contending that there was a link between thimerosal, a preservative, and the “epidemic of childhood neurological disorders” in Rolling Stone and other publications. Indeed, he wrote that the government “colluded with Big Pharma to hide the risks of thimerosal from the public.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There was never a shred of evidence this was true, and, in due time, publications all retracted Mr. Kennedy’s pieces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Mr. Kennedy ignored numerous CDC studies that found no connection between the two. In 2004, researchers in Denmark — a nation with highly accurate centralized health records — conducted a study of every child vaccinated in that country between 1971 and 2000 and found that there “was no trend toward an increase in the incidence of autism during that period when thimerosal was used.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once thimerosal was removed from most vaccines over these fears, Mr. Kennedy moved on to spreading unfalsifiable paranoia about alleged unknown factors in MMR shots causing a giant spike in autism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At least 27 major studies have found no connection between MMR vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How many studies will draw an apology from Mr. Kennedy? 28? 128?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, in 2013, a CDC study found no connection between the number of vaccine antibodies used and the risk of an autism diagnosis. In 2015, JAMA published the largest randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial on vaccines ever done, analyzing the health records of more than 95,000 children and found that MMR vaccine did not increase the risk of autism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s good to “question science.” Serious people are out there doing it every day. Only if you spend your life ignoring the preponderance of the scientific evidence, you’re not “questioning science,” you’re just a quack. In this case, a dangerous one.&lt;/p&gt;

At least 77 of them were reported in children and teens under 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In New Mexico, officials said nine people had become sick in Lea County, along the state's eastern border with Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles is highly contagious and can be deadly. The outbreaks come amid a rise in US anti-vaccine sentiment, including towards the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab that is typically given during childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Health officials in Texas say their figures are likely to be an underestimate, as some parents may not report infections or may not realise their child has the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It is troubling, because this was completely preventable," Dr Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University, told CBS News, the BBC's US news partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It's the most contagious infectious disease known to humans," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Symptoms of the highly-infectious illness include fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A measles infection can have particularly devastating complications for pregnant women and young children, including pneumonia, neurological impairment, hearing loss and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Survivors are at risk of developing a degenerative brain and nervous system disease known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most US children receive two shots to protect against the illness, which together are 97% effective in protecting against measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Health experts say that the disease could be controlled or even eradicated with proper inoculation rates - generally defined as 95% of a community receiving the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But vaccination rates have dropped in some communities in recent decades as a loose network of vaccine sceptics have, without evidence, questioned the safety and efficacy of the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr, recently confirmed as US President Donald Trump's health secretary, has faced strong criticism for his ties to these groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most states require that children receive the MMR vaccine to attend school, but many, including Texas, also allow families to file a conscientious exemption - a non-medical reason to refuse a vaccine requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In Texas, federal data shows that the state achieved a 94.3% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2023-2024 school year, while New Mexico reached 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But a state survey of Texas schools found that rates of exemptions were ticking upwards for MMR and other required vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In Gaines County, where 57 of the Texas cases were reported, exemptions have surged over the last decade. State data shows 17.62% of students had a conscientious exemption to at least one required vaccine during the 2023-2024 school year, up from 7.45% in the 2013-2014 year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Neighbouring Terry County, home to 20 cases, saw exemption rates go from zero to 3.73% in the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Texas officials reported that of the 90 cases in their state, 85 were in people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;CBS reports that the area is home to a large Mennonite community, which typically have low vaccination rates due to the group's religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some officials are reluctant to intervene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"We respect everyone's right to vaccinate or not get vaccinated," Albert Pilkington, CEO of the nearby Seminole Hospital District, told the Texas Standard. "That's just what it means to be an American, right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;US children have been vaccinated against measles since 1963. The jab was improved and combined with vaccines for the mumps and rubella viruses about a decade later, and is widely considered to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Prior to the vaccine's introduction, around 48,000 people were hospitalized with measles each year and 400–500 people died. In 2024, the US reported 285 cases with 114 hospitalisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Health officials in New Mexico are offering a free vaccine clinic this week in an effort to boost protection. Texas also directed residents to contact their doctors or visit a clinic to get vaccinated if they have not previously received a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 08:49:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTFAxVTR6cDdHV1VtZWpsUG9xSUxCcmxjUWN2ZzcySjBEb1EzYzJmX2N0aHh0RmFYbGhIRVdlM2VUeDQ2dm8tcVF3RE5ibDZfTFVPUWNvZmdaVUpBUUtMT1k5a0s3REdSbGtqVlpfbkhLNTNKWmpCS0dlcGlLNTQ</guid></item><item><title>8 benefits of eating 1 guava daily - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;amp-story-grid-layer class="recircular" id="rcontent" template="vertical"&gt;&lt;div class="letterbox"&gt;&lt;p class="mid-heading"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You may also like&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc3 pa"&gt;What foods are good enough to nourish cu...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc5 pa"&gt;Yoga poses to straighten spine (and redu...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/amp-story-grid-layer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 08:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>The Most Common COVID Symptoms Doctors Are Seeing In Winter 2025 - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many viruses circulating this winter, including &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/coronavirus" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="COVID-19" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b7899fe4b04144c748cb47" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/news/topic/coronavirus" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, which is making people ill across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“COVID has continued to circulate year-round, and we’re starting to see patterns where there’s a clear uptick of activity in the winter,” said &lt;a href="https://www.upmc.com/media/experts/graham-snyder" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Graham Snyder" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b7899fe4b04144c748cb47" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.upmc.com/media/experts/graham-snyder" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Dr. Graham Snyder&lt;/a&gt;, the medical director of infection prevention and hospital epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t surprising, Snyder said. In the colder months, we’re more likely to socialize indoors, where germs can more easily spread.

A number of winter illnesses have symptoms that overlap with those of COVID-19, but there is antiviral treatment specifically for COVID that can help you feel better faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antiviral treatment is particularly important for folks who are more at risk of having a severe infection. That includes older people and people with underlying health conditions, Snyder said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the antiviral treatment to work, you have to take it earlier in the course of the disease. The longer you wait, the less likely it is to be successful,” Snyder said. In other words, it’s important to know whether you have COVID as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You won’t necessarily have all of the symptoms mentioned above, according to Snyder. You may have one, or a few, he said, “but those are all typical symptoms of COVID-19.” For some people, their infection will result in no symptoms at all, while others get sick enough to end up in the hospital. That’s another reason it’s important to take a test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To stay healthy, get the most recent COVID shot if you haven’t yet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a 2024-2025 seasonal &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-covid-vaccine-fall-2024_l_66c77ebee4b029313b6f6fbe" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="COVID vaccine" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b7899fe4b04144c748cb47" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="66c77ebee4b029313b6f6fbe" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;COVID vaccine&lt;/a&gt; and it’s recommended for everybody six months of age and older,” Snyder said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest shot can help reduce the chances that you get the virus ― and if you do get sick, it can help prevent complications that might otherwise lead to hospitalization and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;Go Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next four years will change America forever.

And even a nutritional deficiency, like low levels of Vitamin B12, can play a role in this, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, pinpointing the root cause requires a thorough evaluation, as tremors can be multifactorial,” he suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What might make the issue worse?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor suggests lifestyle factors can “significantly” influence the severity of tremors – so if you’re experiencing them regularly, you might want to adopt some lifestyle changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Stress and anxiety are major contributors, and I always recommend stress management techniques to my patients. Caffeine and certain medications can also exacerbate tremors, so moderating these is beneficial,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally he’s also noticed that changes in sleep patterns and fatigue can worsen tremors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ensuring adequate rest and maintaining a balanced diet can be surprisingly effective in managing symptoms. Small lifestyle tweaks can often lead to noticeable improvements,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/tremor-or-shaking-hands/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="According to the NHS" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b5dbf8e4b0be61010cf009" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/tremor-or-shaking-hands/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;According to the NHS&lt;/a&gt;, a tremor might become more noticeable in the following circumstances:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;as you get older;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;when you’re stressed, tired, anxious or angry;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;after drinking caffeine, drinking alcohol, or smoking;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;if you’re very hot or cold.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding that not all tremors indicate a serious underlying condition is important,” says Dr Cunningham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, the stigma and worry surrounding them can sometimes exacerbate the issue. It’s important to address the emotional impact as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When should I seek help about the shakes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you find your shaking is persistent, getting worse, or affecting daily activities, it’s time to book a GP visit to rule out underlying issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my experience, any tremor that interferes with daily activities warrants a closer look. Particularly if accompanied by other symptoms like difficulty in movement or speech, medical advice is crucial,” says Dr Cunningham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s always better to err on the side of caution. I’ve seen peace of mind restored simply by confirming that a tremor is benign. Early intervention can also make a significant difference in the management of more serious conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your tremor is impacting your life, you might be prescribed something for it to reduce the shaking. If it’s impacting your head or voice, the NHS suggests you could be given injections to block the nerves and relax the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are several approaches to managing tremors,” says the doctor. “I always recommend starting with lifestyle modifications, such as reducing caffeine and managing stress.

    &lt;p&gt;If you brush your teeth morning and night, you probably think your oral health is in pretty good nick. But skipping the extra step of flossing – something only three in 10 people in the UK do daily – could not only leave you at risk of cavities, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/skin/gum-disease-treatments/"&gt;gum disease&lt;/a&gt; and loose teeth, but also chronic health problems such as &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/heart-health/signs-heart-disease/"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/dementia/dementia-guide-symptoms-causes-treatment/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/diabetes/body-type-2-diabetes-symptoms-risk/"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because a slimy biofilm is constantly trying to grow on our teeth, explains Morag Powell, a hygienist, dental therapist and lecturer at the University of Plymouth. &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/bones-joints/why-you-are-brushing-your-teeth-all-wrong/"&gt;Brushing your teeth&lt;/a&gt; twice a day will remove this substance from the outside and inside of the teeth but not from that hard-to-reach surface between the teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If left to grow and mature in these gaps, the biofilm may eventually trigger gum disease – when the gums become swollen, red, sore and bleed. But the inflammation doesn’t stop there – it spreads throughout the rest of the body as well, Powell says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people can’t comprehend the links between gum and overall health, says Dr Zoe Brookes, an associate professor of dental education and research at the University of Plymouth. “But imagine having an infected wound the size of your palm,” she says. “That’s how big the infection is if you’ve got gum disease. That’s going to be affecting your whole body as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve spent a lifetime trying to increase awareness of the value and importance of cleaning between the teeth and that’s what [all dentists] need to do, so patients are more inclined to do it,” says Powell. Simply flossing for a few minutes a day will not only keep you in your dentists’ good books but also help you to dodge an array of health problems. Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;1. Flossing every day will lower your risk of stroke&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flossing just once a week cuts the risk of having a stroke by 44 per cent, according to one recent &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/30/flossing-teeth-lower-stroke-risk/"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; from the University of South Carolina School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists looked at the health records of more than 6,000 people and found that those who flossed weekly were also 12 per cent less likely to develop atrial fibrillation (an irregular heartbeat).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts believe their findings may be down to flossing reducing the chance of oral infections and lowering inflammation in the body, which in turn reduces the risk of suffering a stroke and heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that people who have gum disease are more likely to have cardiovascular disease,” says Brookes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as inflammation in the mouth causing problems for the heart, it could also be that the bacteria that infects unhealthy gums travels to the blood vessels, she notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;em&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;), a bacteria that drives gum disease, has been detected in atherosclerotic plaques (a build-up of fats in the artery walls), which suggests a causal link between gum and poor heart health, Brookes explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;2. It will help protect your brain health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/4/1/pgae543/7960038?login=false" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Exeter linked the presence of &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; in the mouth – the bacteria known to fuel gum disease – with a decline in brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team, who analysed saliva samples from 115 people aged over 50, found that &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; was more common in people with memory problems. Another family of bacteria linked to poor oral health, called &lt;em&gt;Prevotella&lt;/em&gt; was also linked to poor brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping teeth clean – through brushing and flossing – is key for protecting brain health, the scientists concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000207579" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, from a team at Tohoku University in Japan, found people with gum disease and tooth loss had shrinking in the hippocampus (part of the brain critical for memory and learning). The researchers said their findings should encourage people to take better care of their teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;3. It reduces your risk of rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors know that rheumatoid arthritis is caused by the immune system going into overdrive and mistakenly attacking the cells that line the joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abq8476"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that flare-ups in the condition – causing swollen, stiff and painful joints – may be caused by gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study from The Rockefeller University suggests that bacteria present in the mouth of patients with gum disease can leak through the gums, into the bloodstream and activate the immune system, causing arthritis symptoms to worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It does make sense,” says Brookes. “In &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/bones-joints/rheumatoid-arthritis-causes-symptoms-treatments/"&gt;rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt;, there’s an antibody – citrullinated proteins – that initiates an immune response. There could be an indirect link between gum disease and the activation of this antibody, which then goes on to affect the joints,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;4. Flossing regularly could lower your pancreatic cancer risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining good oral health has been linked to a lower risk of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/pancreatic-cancer-symptoms-causes-and-treatment/"&gt;pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s according to a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2526607"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from NYU Langone Medical Center. Researchers compared saliva samples from 720 people, half of whom later develop pancreatic cancer. Results showed that those with high levels of &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; had a 59 per cent higher risk of developing the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explaining their findings, the scientist suggested that the inflammation caused by &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; may have caused inflammation in the pancreas which led to cancer, or that the bacteria may have been a signal of cancer-causing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The links between cancer and gum disease is a more controversial area,” Brookes notes. There have been some individual studies showing a connection but association has not been the subject of a systemic review, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;5. Slashes Type 2 diabetes risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Poor oral health has been linked with Type 2 diabetes,” Brookes notes. That’s because having gum disease is known to increase blood sugar levels, which in turn increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, gum disease triggers inflammation throughout the body, which is another risk factor for the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have type 2 diabetes are also at greater risk of gum disease, as they have a more aggressive inflammatory response to the bacteria in their mouth, she says. “There’s a bit of a chicken and egg – gum disease might cause diabetes but diabetes actually might make gum disease worse as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to floss and use interdental brushes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Flossing&lt;/h2&gt;

Pharmaceutical companies initially released the drugs &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326252" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; (semaglutide) and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/drugs-mounjaro" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mounjaro&lt;/a&gt; (tirzepatide) to help with blood sugar control in &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317462" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the medication also contributes to weight loss, both drugs were later released as Wegovy and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/drugs-zepbound" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Zepbound&lt;/a&gt; to help people with obesity. While semaglutide and tirzepatide are the most popular of the GLP-1 drugs at the moment, some other medications in this class include &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/drugs-saxenda-side-effects" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;liraglutide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/drugs-trulicity" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;dulaglutide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many people who take GLP-1 medications for weight loss experience tremendous benefits from the drugs, the drugs may have other uses. For example, a recent study showed that GLP-1s may help &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/ozempic-wegovy-curb-alcohol-cravings-heavy-drinking" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;curb binge drinking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a review conducted by scientists from the United Kingdom and Canada, researchers examined numerous studies to determine how these drugs affect cognitive abilities and mental health. While some studies they reviewed were positive regarding improving cognitive functioning, others had mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551568/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;existing research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, the “function of GLP-1 agonists is to lower serum glucose levels and thereby manage metabolism in affected patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs also improve blood flow to the heart and act directly on the hypothalamus to increase the sensation of being full after a meal. Besides these metabolic effects, GLP-1 drugs also appear to have an impact on brain health and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since some &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661824002573" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show that GLP-1 drugs may have an impact on addictive behaviors, this makes scientists wonder what other neurological impacts the drug can have. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers who conducted the new review utilized data from hundreds of clinical studies, preclinical studies, controlled trials, and meta-analyses to learn more about how GLP-1 medications impact the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some areas the scientists focused on included animal studies on &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/159442" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; and Parkinson’s diseases, dementia risk in people with a background of obesity or type 2 diabetes, and cognitive functioning tests in people with obesity or diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at studies that analyzed how GLP-1 drugs affected substance abuse disorders, psychotic disorders, and mood and anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs are promising in some areas and need more research in others. For instance, the review showed that GLP-1 drugs may have promising outcomes for people with dementia or other neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There is also evidence for mechanisms involving a reduction of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5025335/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;neuroinflammation&lt;/a&gt;, an increase in synaptic functioning, as well as the restoration of brain pathways of insulin signaling that may lead to improved memory formation and therefore a positive effect in Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease,” note the authors. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 100 preclinical research studies suggests that GLP-1 drugs could protect against cognitive decline. These findings are significant to people with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that GLP-1 drugs offer protection by reducing harmful brain proteins, inflammation, and insulin resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the findings for clinical studies were more mixed, and long-term trials showed the possibility of a lower dementia risk with these drugs, but shorter trials did not show consistent cognitive improvements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review findings for how GLP-1s affect substance abuse disorders were largely promising, but the authors note that human studies are mostly in the early stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies using animal research showed that GLP-1 drugs helped reduce cravings for several substances by affecting dopamine pathways. Some of the substances tested include alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, and opioids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The researchers were also interested in how GLP-1 drugs can protect mental health. The number of studies available in humans was limited, and the results were mixed. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that the use of GLP-1 drugs in people with schizophrenia spectrum conditions helped with comorbid diabetes and obesity. The researchers found this promising in terms of mitigating some of the cardiometabolic issues that antipsychotic drugs may create. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research showed that GLP-1s can offer neuroprotective benefits in people taking mood stabilizers. However, something concerning the researchers came across in their review was people with anxiety and depression sometimes experience worsened symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some case reports noted concerns over exenatide and semaglutide worsening depressive symptoms, and a larger study suggested a slightly increased risk of suicidal behavior with liraglutide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, as GLP-1RAs become increasingly prescribed, further pharmacovigilance studies are warranted,” noted the authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mir Ali, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, spoke with &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; about the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“GLP-1 agonists appear to have applications beyond diabetes and weight loss; however, it is not easy to separate these benefits from improvement in diabetes or weight loss,” Ali comented. “In other words, it is difficult to prove that these medications provide a direct benefit, rather than a secondary benefit from either weight loss or control of diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said more research is needed to determine if and how GLP-1 drugs can cause mood disturbances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Changes in mood can occur from many sources, including weight loss, so further research is necessary to delineate the actual mechanism,” pointed out Ali. “Overall, serious side effects, such as suicidal ideations are very rare.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I find the reduction in inflammation most compelling.

We need well-designed, long-term clinical trials to determine whether these drugs can be effectively used to preserve cognitive function or even treat neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease,” Merrill emphasized. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 06:42:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxQd25tNUNCSEVyaGxQRmx5RDhudEhOdW1hbV9IMFlNeERoWXVPQUJiUEJVdWVxazgtQnJOQVY0RzJKeGlpeWJXMVc4eHdaRTRfNjF5cmM4QVFoMUxVa1BDbkZvM0VuYVlIYmRlNUhncTQzVUFFbjhMWWtlTU92Y1pWbUh6REpZNkk1bmNHSUxUNVpKS0tUWW14Z1dpcE5yRmZrZi1HTnJGZnp1dkxTTExkTg</guid></item><item><title>Israeli scientists fuse ‘brain tissue’ and electronic chips to test autism treatment - The Times of Israel</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of Israel</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 06:18:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNdUVDdXVFeFprQzA2M2N1aUNiTHh2dDdnY0VEcjBxYkVIRzFJcDVObE1STHlyMGFYYnMxOHdsT3NwMDc3LXdxd0dKX21kSnN0dVI4UjhhamdjeU1EaFIzWTdoaUVKYUxsQlZCWGI3MGZUbDdWSHhfN0RCVEZJS3FtR1dZTkE0YUNZcHNjWWpLMFEyYWN0cVpDMjBrbTN6ZkxTZmthWGpPcEpFZUNNWGh2UzZoVdIBuAFBVV95cUxPdXdlSU9YLVBubVltNm5lZmpadFFreFJNUHB2WGNaaDVzWlhMLVZLQk1kSEMwQ3BISHNGSGNfSlhzMTJ1RFIwVDUxMTZQN244VHdhaTlJSzhCY0dEU29TUjlfVVN2cE4xT3BubEs5SmRITl9sdkJuOWRjTG9IS1c5S3VqM210Y0NialNUQTdvWDN0TVdpLVRpTXFoM3NjblUyZWk3YkVmQ3JDUmZtU3lYMFlIQnlzdUJZ</guid></item><item><title>"Live a longer, more independent and vibrant life"—a physical therapist shares the daily 10-minute balance routine she swears by - Fit and Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi8wFBVV95cUxQdklqN2wwLXBLOUItS2pReW8tX29nQUpNdkFzTGNUdE8tdXRwbnZkbHNoSjJVTkE2M1BoTzlKWUxQS3IwTkpXRVloTms4QVV6VllCN09UN0VUdjc1S1VBLVcyUy1oZWJ4WFFGUHVVRnZyVFJBQkxKSnJQdlFFQ0J4eUU4ZnAwUndHNFo5eHFfODdGZS1JbDZkRUo4UF9vOFpPMG1sTnhIWVFEVG9LNnpZazlfcVBFc05wRmVEcTJ2a0NqeEdteWg4bFJra0pfbmU3R2NBbjlhbGR5WTZWZHhDTFQ1NV9CLVk1NDFTV2NvSWlQTm8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between a nine-to-five job, caring for kids, and juggling an already-packed workout schedule, something as simple as balance training might take a backseat. But as we age, our balance naturally declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple tests such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/can-t-balance-on-one-leg-a-physical-therapist-says-you-need-to-do-this-strength-boosting-exercise" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/can-t-balance-on-one-leg-a-physical-therapist-says-you-need-to-do-this-strength-boosting-exercise"&gt;standing on one leg&lt;/a&gt; or using a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/wobble-board-challenge" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/wobble-board-challenge"&gt;wobble board &lt;/a&gt;can help you assess your balance. However, balance training is essential to maintaining functional fitness—which is the strength to perform everyday tasks like climbing stairs or getting up from a chair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news? You don't need to spend hours training to see improvements. Physical therapist Jessica Valant has shared a simple balance routine that only takes 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-the-10-minute-balance-routine"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do the 10-minute balance routine &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="youtube-video youtube-facade" data-nosnippet&gt;

"Regardless if you are standing in place or moving through space, balance is critical to keeping you upright."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams says the benefits of better balance equate to "a better life", as it will allow you to be independent and move with confidence as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that you’re never too old (or young) to improve your balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've seen patients in their 90s and even over 100 years old improve their balance when working through a guided balance and exercise program," says Williams. "It is never too late to get better."&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p&gt;You know you should develop a regular exercise routine, but you lack motivation. Promises to yourself are quickly broken, and you never establish enough of the workout habit to experience any rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercising as you age is important. It’s not only good for physical health to help prevent falls or enable you to do basic tasks — exercise is also superb for the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you want to be cognitively active, it is so important to be physically active,” explained Dr. Amy Eyler, a professor of public health at Washington University in St. Louis. “There is a such a strong connection between these two behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why make exercise part of my routine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, regular exercise helps maintain bone density and muscle strength. It also lowers the risk of heart disease and certain types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For older people, regular exercise helps maintain strength and balance and allows them to live independently. Research also suggests the immune system may get a bump from physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a psychological component. Successfully completing a daily exercise can improve one’s mood and sense of self-satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting into the habit of doing regular physical activity can be difficult for some. The motivation to get moving is different for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially you’ll need external motivation — I want to be able to play with my grandkids or keep driving the car — until you see results and the motivation shifts to internal, Eyler said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you set a goal, you should ask yourself on a scale of 1 to 100, how confident am I that I can do this?” Eyler explained. “It has to be over the 90% level of confidence or you’re not going to do it. Lots of people set these goal too high and then fail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build to your goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just walk whenever you can,” Eyler said. “You can walk for 10 minutes pretty much anywhere — indoors, at work, at home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, if you’re trying to encourage others, look for positive reasons rather than nagging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Telling someone they will be more independent if they take their blood pressure medicine is better than — take your blood pressure medicine,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips about how to start — and how to stay with it — from three gym rats between the ages of 77 and 86. All got started late and have stayed with it. All three work out with Dr. Irv Rubenstein, an exercise scientist who runs STEPS Fitness in Nashville, Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘I always hated gym class’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathryn Dettwiller, 77, got pushed into exercising 34 years ago by her husband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I always hated gym class,” she said. “I always hated getting down on the floor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She works out in a gym twice a week with a trainer, which she said gives her added discipline and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The external has become internal because I realize I need it,” she said. She cautioned beginners to expect some setbacks — minor injuries — and not to be discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Try it as soon as your body starts playing out on you,” she said. “It’s like a game of Whack-A-Mole. One time your leg hurts, the next time it’s your back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It added structure to his life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick Bolsom, 82, enjoys the structure of having a trainer. In his case, his wife got him started almost two decades ago and he’s into a three-times-a-week routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I kept doing it because I had a sense of feeling better,” he said. “The key to me was probably doing it with a trainer. The structure really helped me to continue with it. Now it’s just become part of my life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t imagine quitting it,” he added. “I work out as vigorously as I did 15, 18 years ago. It turned out to be the smart thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bolsom also added in the social aspect to training in a gym or studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I retired a few years ago. You do miss the connectivity with people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flattery will get you everywhere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Grover Smith, a retired radiologist, is 86 and still going strong. He attributes this partly to training regularly in a gym three times a week, a habit he didn’t start until he was 74 and well into retirement. He was coaxed to go after several visits to his cardiologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he went after the fourth time his cardiologist suggested it, although he was not having any specific heart problems. His plan was to go once to appease the cardiologist and that would be it. That was more than a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Medicine was basically my life and it was very time consuming,” Smith said. “It was sometimes seven days a week and I didn’t have time for a lot of other things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s not only fit, but now he also gets flattered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He tells the story about a recent visit to a doctor who, after looking at his charts, told him: “Dr. Smith, you look 15 years younger than your age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith laughed as he added the punchline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would have told her to get her eyes examined — except she’s an ophthalmologist,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;

A recent study published in Cell found that the virus closely resembles the strain responsible for the 2020 pandemic, reports the New York Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly discovered virus is named HKU5-CoV-2 and has the potential for animal-to-human transmission. No infections have been recorded in people so far. The study, led by renowned virologist Dr Shi Zhengli, found that the bat virus can bind to proteins found in humans and other mammals, similar to how SARS-CoV-2—the virus behind Covid-19—infects human cells. However, researchers note that its potential to spread to humans “remains to be investigated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HKU5-CoV-2 belongs to the same coronavirus family as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), a severe illness that can spread from camels to humans through direct contact. MERS outbreaks have primarily occurred in countries near the Arabian Peninsula, such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wuhan Institute of Virology has been at the centre of global controversy over theories that Covid-19 may have leaked from its lab, an allegation China has repeatedly denied. The first recorded human case of Covid-19 emerged in Wuhan in November 2019, eventually triggering a worldwide crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covid-19 went on to become the deadliest pandemic of the century, claiming millions of lives across the globe. According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/world-health-organisation" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; (WHO), more than 7 million deaths have been officially recorded, but estimates suggest the actual toll could be as high as 20 million due to unreported cases. The United States alone lost over 1.2 million people, while India, Brazil, and several European nations also suffered devastating losses. The pandemic not only overwhelmed healthcare systems but also caused economic disruptions and long-term health complications for millions who survived the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="js_tbl_readmore_btn" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 03:56:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Never Take Ibuprofen If You Have These 3 Symptoms!

It is effective in reducing pain, inflammation, and fever, making it a go-to option for headaches, muscle aches, arthritis, and menstrual cramps. However, despite its benefits, ibuprofen is not safe for everyone. The NHS has issued a warning about potential side effects and health risks, particularly for people with allergies or pre-existing medical conditions. Some people may experience mild to severe reactions after taking ibuprofen, and in certain cases, it can lead to serious complications. The NHS advises that anyone who notices unusual symptoms after using ibuprofen should stop taking it immediately and consider alternative pain relief options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Signs of an Adverse Reaction&lt;/h2&gt;The NHS advises people to stop using ibuprofen immediately if they develop:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1884"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;Runny nose – This may seem minor, but it could be an early sign of an allergic reaction.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skin reactions – Rashes, redness, or itching can indicate the body is negatively responding to the drug.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wheezing or breathing difficulties – These symptoms could suggest a severe allergic reaction, especially for people with asthma.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;If you experience any of these symptoms, it is best to stop taking ibuprofen and consult a doctor for alternative pain relief options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1884"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen is not safe for everyone.

Doctors may prescribe additional medication to protect the stomach if ibuprofen is necessary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dangerous Drug Interactions&lt;/h2&gt;Ibuprofen can interact with other medications, making them less effective or increasing the risk of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1884"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;Blood thinners (e.g., warfarin) – This combination can raise the risk of excessive bleeding.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other NSAIDs (e.g., aspirin, naproxen) – Taking multiple NSAIDs can amplify side effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Certain antibiotics, antidepressants, and diabetes medications – These may not work as expected or could lead to complications when combined with ibuprofen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Herbal supplements (e.g., ginkgo biloba) – These may further increase the risk of bleeding when taken with ibuprofen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;However, ibuprofen is generally safe to take with paracetamol or codeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Use Ibuprofen Responsibly&lt;/h2&gt;The NHS urges people to be cautious when using ibuprofen and to seek medical advice if they have any concerns. While it is a common and effective painkiller, it is essential to recognize potential risks, especially for those with existing health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;If you experience any warning signs, consider switching to an alternative pain relief option like paracetamol, which may be a safer choice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1884"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/latest-news"&gt;Latest News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times Now</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 03:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Six foods that will help you to eat less without trying — or signing up for pricey weight-loss drugs - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxQZW5rSlRuTG5MOHA3b1dvdEkySU5tS1pWSWtZa2lTSGtVUzhoTUdYZWxjZ2tFUFh6N00tQ082LWdPeTM1cEYyU2V4YmNEMUdNS00ySUlrcDZTc2txSTJ5dzdmS043ajFkWXFmdXo3NHhKV1BLUnNtY3VnaFc3cDBJWURJZVV5VWhBdkZUVEJoRnE0UGdlV3NaOEIyX3Y2MzBDWnFEX01JbWlXTDZz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;Heard the one about Ozempic? Haven’t we all — if only millions of Americans who could benefit from this and other trendy weight-loss drugs &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/28/health/ozempic-which-costs-up-to-1300-can-be-made-for-5-study/"&gt;could get them covered through their insurance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But you don’t have to sign up for the pricey jabs to shed the pounds, some experts say — there’s a way to beat the odds in &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/10/health/ultra-processed-foods-drive-colorectal-cancer-risk-prevent-healing-study/"&gt;a food culture that seems rigged against those struggling&lt;/a&gt; to control their eating. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a processed food, treat yo’ self world, nutrition expert Mark Hewett of &lt;a href="https://gainsnutrition.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Gains Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; says that there’s an easy way to take back control — and it’s not counting calories, or running your tail off at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ginger’s low glycemic index is just one of its many benefits, an expert explained. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Luis Echeverri Urrea – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding what drives hunger, according to Hewett, is the key to making better choices. In focusing purely on willpower, people overlook important contributors such as the glycemic index, or GI, of foods. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This number, which you can easily look up for any food your thinking of eating, tells you how it will impact your blood sugar — and how quickly your cravings will return after you eat.&lt;/p&gt;


	





&lt;p&gt;Prioritizing foods with low-GI, Hewett said, could in fact be the quickest and easiest way to naturally learn appetite control&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Most people focus on calories, but research shows that the way foods impact blood sugar can be just as important in managing hunger,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Low-GI foods (with a glycemic index of 55 or less) are digested and absorbed more slowly, leading to gradual blood sugar changes instead of sharp spikes and crashes. This helps regulate appetite, keeping you full longer and reducing cravings naturally.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ready to put the science to the test? Here are six low-GI foods to work into your diet — see how they work for you. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avocados&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Africa Studio – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With a glycemic index of just 5, avocados digest incredibly slowly, providing steady energy without triggering the blood sugar spikes that often lead to cravings,” Hewett explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Their combination of fiber and healthy fats keeps appetite hormones in check, making them one of the most effective foods for natural appetite control.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asparagus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;nata_vkusidey – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With a glycemic index of 15, asparagus is an excellent choice for appetite control. Its high fiber content slows digestion while adding volume to meals, helping you feel full without excessive calories. Asparagus also supports gut health, which plays a crucial role in hunger regulation,” Hewett said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almonds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;kuvona – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With a glycemic index of 15, almonds offer a powerful blend of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. Unlike high-carb snacks that cause sugar spikes and crashes, almonds digest slowly, providing steady energy and preventing sudden cravings. Their nutrient profile also helps regulate appetite hormones like ghrelin and leptin, which control hunger and satiety.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black Olives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Igor Dutina – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With a glycemic index of 15, black olives provide a unique mix of monounsaturated fats and polyphenols that support appetite regulation. These healthy fats slow digestion, keeping you full longer. The polyphenols in olives have also been linked to reduced inflammation, which prevents erratic hunger signals.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chili&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Kristen – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“With a glycemic index of 15, chili peppers contain capsaicin. Capsaicin has been shown to mildly boost metabolism while suppressing appetite, making it a powerful tool for natural weight management. Consuming spicy foods can lead to a lower calorie intake throughout the day without conscious effort.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ginger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Atlas – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With a glycemic index of 15, ginger is well-known for its digestion-enhancing and appetite-regulating properties. It helps control hunger by increasing thermogenesis (calorie burning) and improving insulin sensitivity, preventing post-meal crashes that trigger cravings,” Hewett said.” &lt;/p&gt;

Four more kids died from the flu during the week ending Feb. 15, increasing the seasonal pediatric death toll by more than a third, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With regard to COVID-19, “we just thought about older adults as getting sick,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist and professor of medicine at UC San Francisco. “We have to reset with flu. Because with flu, it’s not just the very old, it’s also the very young. And they can do very poorly.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 15 children who died from the flu this season includes &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/fourth-san-diego-county-teen-dies-from-flu/3755554/" target="_blank"&gt;four teenagers from San Diego&lt;/a&gt;. None of the teens — aged 14, 15, 16 and 17 — had received flu shots, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These recent flu deaths among our youth are tragic and concerning as we head into what historically is the peak of flu season,” Dr. Ankita Kadakia, San Diego County’s interim public health officer, said in a statement  this month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates have declined, particularly among children, for the flu and other ailments, according to Chin-Hong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationally, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/coverage-by-season/2020-2021.html#:~:text=Among%20children%206%20months%20through%2017%20years%2C%20the%20percentage%20receiving,(63.7%25%3B%20Figure%201)." target="_blank"&gt;roughly 58% of&lt;/a&gt; children between 6 months and 17 were vaccinated against the flu during the 2020-21 season, declining to about 45% as of late January of this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the world of vaccines, that’s like falling off a cliff,” Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trend is similar in California: 47.7% of California’s children have been vaccinated against flu as of late January, the lowest since at least the 2019-20 flu season. Last year at this time, 53.7% of children were vaccinated against flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/vaccinations.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommends everyone&lt;/a&gt; 6 months or older get a flu shot — ideally by the end of October to boost protection against the disease during high-circulation winter months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two types of flu generally circulating now are H1N1 — related to the swine flu strain that &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-aug-10-la-sci-who-flu-20100811-story.html"&gt;caused a flu pandemic&lt;/a&gt; in 2009 and 2010 — and H3N2, which “is notorious for just causing more serious illness in general,” Chin-Hong &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-02-11/worst-flu-season-in-5-years-hits-california"&gt;said previously&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given how potent this flu season has already proved to be, officials say those who have yet to be vaccinated should consider doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While flu activity remains high, it may be decreasing. California public health officials’ recent report shows a 3.4% decline in the rate at which flu tests returned positive results at the state’s clinical sentinel labs for the week ending Feb. 15, the most recent for which complete data are available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the test positivity rate sits at an elevated 23.3%. COVID-19 and RSV activity is low, health officials said, with positivity rates of 2.3% and 5%, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong said it’s not yet clear if the downward trend will hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s too early to celebrate,” he said, adding that more data points are needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu season in the U.S. typically &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season.html#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20flu%20season%20usually%20occurs%20in%20the,varies%20from%20season%20to%20season." target="_blank"&gt;peaks between December and February&lt;/a&gt;, though the virus spreads year-round, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if it’s on the decline, the virus is known for having a prolonged season, Chin-Hong said. It can run through April and sometimes later in the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not only the peak that we’re worried about,” Chin-Hong said. “It’s also the breadth of what’s happening this year.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were about 500 deaths last season from the flu by this point in time, and 600 the year before, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/02/22/more-than-900-californians-including-15-children-have-died-from-the-flu-this-season/" target="_blank"&gt;the Mercury News reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong estimates he hasn’t seen a death toll like that of this season in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Times staff writer Rong-Gong Lin II contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 01:08:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2AFBVV95cUxPMGY1bGJRWDZkUEozUnBhSmZCWFFtMmxNbFRlSGUwazlGeDVwZ283bHFsRTZHZW02R1JUdzEzc1dXSzNfbFltQnUzNWpZbThuWmV5UVNKOGVnTzZ6bFdOUEItb3l4RV9ScUtlNEJhek03UnowS3lfMHpoQUhzMkptalU0djZvLWdYMWpPcmU3T1hKMi1EVlh4amgxUWk3bDM2SDNMd1ZmeTNQOFRuYjFxOUhJakQ1cUxPZFhEWGpkV19YTFE5cHhzRV9CNlFXNV9jWUg1bVJsaE8</guid></item><item><title>More than 900 Californians, including 15 children, have died from the flu this season - The Mercury News</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s flu season is off to a deadly start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 900 people have died from influenza since the beginning of October in California, more than have died at this point in any of the last six respiratory virus seasons, according to a report released Friday by the California Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quarter of those deaths have been among people under 65 years old. Older folks tend to be the most at risk, with about 700 people 65 and older dying so far this year from the common virus. But at least 15 children have also succumbed to the flu, including &lt;a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/fourth-san-diego-county-teen-dies-from-flu/3755554/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;four teenagers in San Diego County&lt;/a&gt;, raising concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When compared to the data reported over the course of previous flu seasons, the toll this year has already exploded past the totals from the last several flu seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point of the season, Week 7, there were about 500 deaths last season, and 600 the year before, but in both of those seasons the deaths had already started to plateau by mid-February. This year, the number of deaths has yet to show signs of slowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a surprise” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco professor of medicine who specializes in infectious diseases. He said it was projected to be an average season, but it is turning out to be anything but. And with test positivity rates still high, there are at least a few weeks left of the virus’s sending people to the hospital before it retreats for its annual hibernation, which usually begins as spring turns to summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is surprising, first of all that we didn’t see much COVID, and secondly that we saw a lot of flu,” Chin-Hong said. “And not just flu — bad flu which is making people seriously ill.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it is important for people to know that despite its being late in the typical virus season, it is not too late to get vaccinated against influenza, whether they have had one strain already or not. Chin-Hong also wants to remind people of the antivirals available to combat the worst outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tamiflu, an antiviral used to treat the flu, can also be used prophylactically to prevent the spread of the virus within a household, and Chin-Hong would recommend those who are living with elderly or at-risk family members to ask their doctor about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The last really bad flu season was in 2009, for swine flu,” Chin-Hong said, “since then it has kind of been regular flu seasons, until this year.”&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;The measles outbreak in rural West Texas has grown to 90 cases across seven counties, the state health department posted online Friday, and 16 people are hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In neighboring eastern New Mexico, the measles case count is up to nine, though state public health officials said Thursday there’s still no evidence this outbreak is connected to the one in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious disease. Here’s what you should know about how to protect yourself against measles, as well as what’s happening in Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;Where are measles spreading?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The West Texas cases are concentrated in Gaines County, which has 57 infections, and Terry County, north of Gaines, where there are now 20 confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawson County, to the east of Gaines, was new to the count with six. Yoakum County has four and Lubbock, Lynn and Ector counties have a case each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/measles-outbreak-raises-concerns-about-drop-in-vaccinations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; Measles outbreak raises concerns about drop in vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas state health department data shows the vast majority of cases are among people younger than 18: 26 in kids younger than 4 and 51 in kids 5-17 years old. Ten adults have measles and three cases are “pending” an age determination. The Ector County Health Department told the &lt;a href="https://www.oaoa.com/local-news/ector-county-health-department-confirms-positive-case-of-measles-in-ector-county-resident/"&gt;Odessa American&lt;/a&gt; its case was in a child too young to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State health officials have said this outbreak is Texas’ largest in nearly 30 years. Health department spokeswoman Lara Anton said last week that cases have been concentrated in a “close-knit, undervaccinated” Mennonite community — especially among families who attend small private religious schools or are homeschooled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In New Mexico, all of the cases are in Lea County, which borders Gaines County in Texas. The state health department has said people may have been exposed at a grocery store, an elementary school, a church, Nor-Lea Hospital and a Walgreens in Hobbs, New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;What is measles?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/index.html#:~:text=Measles%20is%20one%20of%20the,breathes%2C%20coughs%2C%20or%20sneezes."&gt;according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most kids will recover from the measles if they get it, but infection can lead to dangerous complications like pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;Is the vaccine safe?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella&lt;/a&gt; (MMR) vaccine is safe and highly effective in preventing measles infection and severe cases of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old. The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/measles-cases-are-rising-in-the-u-s-heres-why-misinformation-about-the-vaccine-persists-today"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Measles cases are rising in the U.S. Here’s why misinformation about the vaccine persists today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, it’s usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no link between the vaccine and autism, despite a now-discredited study and health disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;Why do vaccination rates matter?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95 percent — diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called “herd immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60. Five years earlier, measles cases were the worst in almost three decades in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged children who opt out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14 percent of K-12 children in the 2023-24 school year. Health officials say that number is likely higher because it doesn’t include many children who are homeschooled and whose data would not be reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;What are public health officials doing to stop the spread?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health workers are hosting regular vaccination clinic and screening efforts in Texas, as well as working with schools to educate people about the importance of vaccination and offering shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Mexico health officials are also hosting several vaccination clinics in Hobbs next week.&lt;/p&gt;

At least 77 of them were reported in children and teens under 17. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In New Mexico, officials said nine people had been sickened in Lea County, along the state's eastern border with Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Measles is highly contagious and can be deadly. The outbreaks come amid a rise in US anti-vaccine sentiment, including towards the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab that is typically received during childhood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Health officials in Texas say those numbers are likely an undercount, as some parents may not report infections or may not realise their child has the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"It is troubling, because this was completely preventable," Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University, told CBS News, the BBC's American news partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"It's the most contagious infectious disease known to humans," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Symptoms of the highly infectious illness include fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation and a signature rash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;A measles infection can have particularly devastating complications for pregnant women and young children, including pneumonia, neurological impairment, hearing loss and death, and survivors are at risk of developing a degenerative brain and nervous system disease known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Most US children receive two shots to protect against the illness, which together are 97% effective in protecting against measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Health experts say that the disease could be controlled or even eradicated with proper inoculation rates - generally defined as 95% of a community receiving the measles vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But vaccination rates have dropped in some communities in recent decades as a loose network of vaccine sceptics have without evidence questioned the safety and efficacy of the shots. Robert F Kennedy Jr, recently confirmed as President Donald Trump's health secretary, faced strong criticism for his ties to these groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Most states require that children receive the MMR vaccine to attend school, but many, including Texas, also allow families to file a conscientious exemption - a non-medical reason to refuse a vaccine requirement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In Texas, federal data shows that the state achieved a 94.3% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2023-2024 school year, while New Mexico reached 95%. But a state survey of Texas schools found that rates of exemptions were ticking upwards for MMR and other required vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In Gaines County, where 57 of the Texas cases were reported, exemptions have surged over the last decade. State data shows 17.62% of students had a conscientious exemption to at least one required vaccine during the 2023-2024 school year, up from 7.45% in the 2013-2014 year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Neighbouring Terry County, home to 20 cases, saw exemption rates go from zero to 3.73% in the same time period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Texas officials reported that of the 90 cases in their state, 85 were in people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;CBS reports that the area is home to a large Mennonite community, which typically have low vaccination rates due to the group's religious beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But some officials are reluctant to intervene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"We respect everyone's right to vaccinate or not get vaccinated," Albert Pilkington, CEO of the nearby Seminole Hospital District, told the Texas Standard. "That's just what it means to be an American, right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;American children have been vaccinated against measles since 1963. The jab was improved and combined with vaccines for the mumps and rubella viruses about a decade later, and is widely considered to be safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Prior to the vaccine's introduction, around 48,000 people were hospitalized with measles each year and 400–500 people died. In 2024, the US reported 285 cases with 114 hospitalisations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Health officials in New Mexico are offering a free vaccine clinic this week in an effort to boost protection. Texas also directed residents to contact their doctors or visit a clinic to get vaccinated if they have not previously received a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 23:24:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBlN1NJWmlQenVYSTlTdERoeVhaWjVmR0twTFc0Q2dkdTRibXZXbmtRS0tUWm1CTmhrV1lWbGhEUXBQTjhQdkowZzEzOFFIS1pMTzRuTWdOLU5SZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE1temxEeDVIUktMb3dael9EVFU2am9OZ3ZieFJjd2pzc0lULWNiQ1d0d043OTNVblNFa0ZkSmNXOG03dlpYNE51bzFFVTZtZUljbDhIME9CRjAtOWpwRDRB</guid></item><item><title>If You Received a Measles Vaccine in This Decade, Check Your Records - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE1IVF84eHc1eXFvNzJ1elQ2M0toTUo2dDFZdDN4NURSNGRYRHlKU0FnN3E0OFlBQWpfbWdwLTBpVExyV0RWT0hxT3BjeHpoRTJpLW1oWHZQbkJwNHNZVHM4TDE2OUktQTV5c3hzRXV4SGcxZFMzMHJqMzBoQlk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Do You Need An MMR Vaccine?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;PeopleImages - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles, or rubeola, probably isn’t an illness you’ve thought too much about, and there’s good reason for that. In 2000, the highly contagious virus was declared to be eliminated in the U.S. It had been a full year since any cases were reported, thanks to high rates of vaccination with the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:MMR (measle,mumps, rubella) vaccine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;MMR (measle,mumps, rubella) vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, which is typically given in early childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in 2019, there was &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/news/health-of-the-public/20191009measlesupdt.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a major outbreak of measles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a major outbreak of measles&lt;/a&gt;, when it appeared in 31 states, for a total of 1,249 cases. Of those cases, 75% occurred in New York City or New York State, primarily among unvaccinated kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last five years were outbreak-free, but &lt;strong&gt;as of February 18, 2025, Texas is experiencing &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/generalinfectiousdisease/114261?xid=nl_mpt_morningbreak2025-02-19&amp;amp;mh=ea0493d246c868ccab6e61d7ce11d245&amp;amp;zdee=gAAAAABm4xC9FpuWPTqYhw97pyhhSupo-ZiielIroe_rhz1wbxXQ5DP4jFN9_aRIHIrWSKy39iLu68HbtCWfke7KVJQgPlrIkd4szaHpX4GQ5nqaAGveSdM%3D" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:its largest measles outbreak;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;its largest measles outbreak &lt;/a&gt;in almost three decades. &lt;/strong&gt;So far, 58 cases have been reported, many of which concentrated in a rural Gaines County community where all the patients are unvaccinated; 13 have been hospitalized. Additionally, eight measles cases have been identified in an adjacent part of &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/generalinfectiousdisease/114261?xid=nl_mpt_morningbreak2025-02-19&amp;amp;mh=ea0493d246c868ccab6e61d7ce11d245&amp;amp;zdee=gAAAAABm4xC9FpuWPTqYhw97pyhhSupo-ZiielIroe_rhz1wbxXQ5DP4jFN9_aRIHIrWSKy39iLu68HbtCWfke7KVJQgPlrIkd4szaHpX4GQ5nqaAGveSdM%3D" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:New Mexico;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the concern is that measles will spread widely, and fast, to other parts of the country. That's because, &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-cases-rising-us-texas-outbreak-grows-concerned/story?id=118892122" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to data from ABC News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to data from ABC News&lt;/a&gt;, more and more parents are opting for exemptions so that their children don’t get the MMR vaccine. During the 2022-23 school year, 3% of all kindergarten students nationwide did not get the vaccine, the highest rate of exemptions ever in the U.S. Texas has an even higher exemption rate of 17.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The CDC recommends two doses of MMR immunizations, with the first dose at age 12 to 15 months and the second dose age 4 to 6 years,” says &lt;a href="https://montefioreeinstein.org/profiles/1538335104/ruchika-jain" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ruchika Jain, MD, MMS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ruchika Jain, MD, MMS&lt;/a&gt;, Infection prevention &amp;amp; control physician at &lt;a href="https://montefioreeinstein.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Montefiore Medical Center;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Montefiore Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; and associate professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, NY. “One dose of MMR vaccine is 93% effective against measles, 78% effective against mumps, and 97% effective against rubella.

Very severe complications can include pneumonia and encephalitis. Children under the age of 5 are most likely to experience these complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does measles spread?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is present in the nose and throat of a child or adult, and is spread by that person coughing or sneezing droplets or by contact with surfaces the droplets have landed on. You can spread measles for around eight days – four days before you see the rash, and during the first four days you have the rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re unvaccinated and have never had measles, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Fmeasles%2Fsymptoms-causes%2Fsyc-20374857&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fwellness%2Fa63869110%2Fmeasles-booster-vaccine%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:your chance of getting the virus is 90%;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;your chance of getting the virus is 90%&lt;/a&gt; after exposure.&lt;/strong&gt; “Measles is very hard to avoid," says &lt;a href="https://www.tuftsmedicine.org/doctor/shira-doron" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Shira Doron, MD, FIDSA, FSHEA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Shira Doron, MD, FIDSA, FSHEA&lt;/a&gt;, chief infection control officer of the Tufts Medicine health system and hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center in Boston. “Vaccination, while not 100% effective at preventing infection, makes the infection less severe in those who do get it.

If you read any misinformation that says otherwise on social media, or hear people say the vaccine is unsafe, take any questions you have straight to your doctor.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s vital that you know the correct facts about the vaccine, and not avoid it by mistake for your kids and/or yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If you were vaccinated against measles as a child, do you need a booster?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The MMR vaccine prevents measles in most people for life;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The MMR vaccine prevents measles in most people for life&lt;/a&gt;. “If you have received two doses of the MMR vaccine as a child, it’s likely you’re protected,” says &lt;a href="https://www.medicalofficesofmanhattan.com/our-team/dr-yoshua-quinones/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Yoshua Quinones, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Yoshua Quinones, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified internist in New York City. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are exceptions, though. “If you received a measles vaccine in the 1960s, you should look into your vaccination records,” says Dr. Jain. “Those who have documents showing they received a live measles vaccine in the 1960s do not need to be revaccinated. People who were vaccinated in the 1960s with a measles vaccine of an unknown type should be revaccinated with at least one dose of live attenuated measles vaccine. From 1963 to 1967, there was a vaccine available that used dead measles virus, which proved to be ineffective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, “healthcare workers may have their MMR levels of antibodies tested,” Dr. Jain continues. “If the test is negative, another single dose of MMR should be administered. Antibody levels may also be checked during pregnancy; you can work with your physician to determine the safest time to receive this immunization.” Ask your doctor about &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.questhealth.com%2Fproduct%2Fmeasles-mumps-rubella-mmr-test-94356M.html%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopxMlTYqCfyLmoxKPFYbPpCHBFmqi9OBrH_wJJNYlYMHyXeA_a2&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fwellness%2Fa63869110%2Fmeasles-booster-vaccine%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:an MMR test;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;an MMR test&lt;/a&gt;, which will measure your immunity. This could be helpful if you don’t have documentation of your vaccine status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise? “If you had the two recommended childhood doses of MMR, you do not need another dose,” says Dr. Doron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If you’re an unvaccinated adult, should you get the vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Yes, yes and yes!” says Dr. Quinones. “If you have never been vaccinated or have lost immunity, it’s strongly recommended to get your vaccine as soon as possible.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want to act quickly, because there’s a time lag in that the shot is a two-step process. “If you have not yet had an MMR vaccine, speak with your doctor to start the immunization process of two doses 28 days apart,” says Dr. Jain. “If you work in healthcare, travel internationally or are a higher education student, these settings have a higher risk for transmission.” Some people do need to avoid the MMR vaccine, including pregnant women or women trying to get pregnant (you can get it later), people with allergies, and people with certain illnesses. Again, ask your doctor about any concerns you have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What else you can do to protect yourself&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you're a teacher around small children — how can you max out prevention? “Ensure that you’re fully vaccinated, and always wash your hands,” advises Dr. Quinones. “If you are a teacher, it’s highly recommended for you to be vaccinated against MMR. Encourage parents (at your school) to get their kids immunized by explaining the risks and benefits of the MMR vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been vaccinated, doing your normal virus prevention stuff – hand hygiene, avoiding those who you know are sick, and wearing a mask–can add an extra layer of measles protection. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.questhealth.com%2Fproduct%2Fmeasles-mumps-rubella-mmr-test-94356M.html%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopxMlTYqCfyLmoxKPFYbPpCHBFmqi9OBrH_wJJNYlYMHyXeA_a2&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fwellness%2Fa63869110%2Fmeasles-booster-vaccine%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:If you get vaccinated within three days after being exposed to measles;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;If you get vaccinated within three days after being exposed to measles&lt;/a&gt;, you may not get sick, or have a milder course of disease, too.

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But other experts in the field of menopause beg to differ. Prof Susan Davis, an endocrinologist at Monash University and one of Australia’s leading experts on menopause, says the conference is not supported by the Australasian &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/menopause" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Menopause&lt;/a&gt; Society and accuses some of the overseas speakers, at least in their social media feeds, of straying beyond the harmonised guidance on treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I can’t pre-empt what they are going to talk about,” Davis says, “but based on the track records of their posts, it’s concerning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“What motivates these women? I don’t know … Are they believing that they see the light where other people don’t see it? Have they had an experience that they have become evangelical about? I really don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The Australasian Menopause Society is a charity for Australian and New Zealand medical professionals who are working in treating menopause. It is an evidence-based organisation that provides education and resources for doctors and, while it is considered to be a specialist authority, it does not offer formal accreditation, unlike the various specialist colleges. Similar societies exist in the UK and US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The conference kicks off with a public session at the Opera House followed the next day by a second session for medical professionals at the Hyatt Regency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="three-doctors-in-the-spotlight" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Three doctors in the spotlight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But it’s the headlining of three international speakers, each with huge internet profiles and flourishing businesses, that is coming under fire from local experts: they are the UK general practitioner Louise Newson, the US obstetrician/gynaecologist Mary Claire Haver and the US urologist Kelly Casperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="edb25729-23ed-404a-9874-ef0c5bc61c5e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":16,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"The unspoken agony of vaginal dryness: ‘I had to give up four jobs in four years’","elementId":"edb25729-23ed-404a-9874-ef0c5bc61c5e","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/16/the-unspoken-agony-of-vaginal-dryness-i-had-to-give-up-four-jobs-in-four-years"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Newson, an Instagrammer with more than 640,000 followers, presented to the Australian Senate’s 2024 inquiry into menopause.

There are clinical trials looking at that dose; there is a GP database that has data regarding the risk of breast cancer and thrombosis [at that dose].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Giving standard doses means patients can be given accurate information about the risk of breast cancer associated with MHT, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;She says if doctors are going to prescribe doses higher than that, “it should be in a clinical trial. And if you put them on these doses, they need more progesterone to avoid endometrial thickening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Newson defends her practices, saying decisions about whether to prescribe MHT and its dosage was made on an individualised basis after discussing the benefits and risks with each patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Every woman is different so a ‘one size fits all’ approach to HRT is not the best for women,” she says. “Some women need higher doses of oestradiol than other women to achieve the same benefits, especially as oestradiol can often be absorbed differently through the skin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;She says Newson Health &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/fulltext/2025/02000/the_range_and_variation_in_serum_estradiol.2.aspx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;has published audit data&lt;/a&gt; showing that some women need higher doses of oestradiol for adequate absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="40ee140e-b721-4a5b-822f-8772f32ab4ce" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":34,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"When the Bleeding Stops / Because I Can review – unexpectedly joyful reflection on menopause","elementId":"40ee140e-b721-4a5b-822f-8772f32ab4ce","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/sep/25/when-the-bleeding-stops-because-i-can-review-the-place-london"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Haver sells menopause supplements under the brand The ’Pause Life as well as diet plans.

The organisers say it is sold out and will now include a live stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The Australasian Menopause Society says advice and treatments for menopause should be evidence-based and consensus-based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Simonis says: “We also need to keep in mind that not everyone’s menopause experience is going to be the same. I think this emphasises the need for a doctor-patient relationship that is going to be one where the woman is listened to. And this is important – being listened to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Cashell says menopause care has been neglected in medical training for decades, leaving many women without the treatment they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This conference brings together leading experts to provide the latest, evidence-based education across a range of topics for healthcare professionals looking after women. We welcome open discussion and differing opinions, but the goal is simple – better education leads to better care for women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 22:55:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPcXFnbkNjdTQ4QXlPTXBQMmRlalZXbGx0Tk1uZkJwV0ZIcF93SEJyT2VYdTQ2ek1SMDN2bUV0RzVRc21hd0RDY0V1ZHdxaXU3cm16akNjRVZYZTRQUDhIbS1VRHp2UWhabzJHSU93V19paEVyUDhoZmJQMERpUHV3eXVUSVpMcW1iRHpYempzYjNaVHNOMHBVMU9jZDRxSDdO</guid></item><item><title>Optimism and Pessimism Shape Resilience and Risk - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE1MUU1BN0lXck0tUVNjd2d3bzZBT0dHNWV6UTdWUmZEYldQRktWT0RBNVFudDJmcUhsRUwxcXJMdWFEZ0hRMmxjVHBfb0VzU0VWbFVnZ0xKV0lmWVoya0x4MHdxaXN4MERNOWRaOGdFUUNyNHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers examined how optimism and pessimism influenced well-being and behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyzing data from a large-scale study of older adults, they found that optimism was linked to lower stress and greater resilience, while lower pessimism was associated with safer health behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimistic individuals worried less, felt less lonely, and exercised more, contributing to better mental health. However, when it came to behaviors that reduced COVID-19 risk, lower pessimism—not higher optimism—was the key factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with a less pessimistic outlook were more likely to stay home and avoid risky activities. The findings suggest that fostering optimism and reducing pessimism could help people better cope with prolonged stressors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimism and Well-Being:&lt;/strong&gt; Optimistic individuals had lower stress, greater resilience, and engaged in more physical activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pessimism and Risk Avoidance:&lt;/strong&gt; People with lower pessimism were more likely to avoid risky behaviors like traveling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coping Strategies Matter:&lt;/strong&gt; Behavioral adaptations, such as exercising at home or using virtual social interactions, contributed to well-being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Syracuse University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you see the glass as half empty or half full? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you rewind to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, chances are you experienced some level of pessimism. And who could blame you? With social isolation, health concerns and economic uncertainty, fear and anxiety became a daily reality for many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers from Syracuse University and Michigan State University recently explored the personal characteristics that help people handle prolonged stressors, such as the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Jeewon Oh, assistant professor of psychology in Syracuse University’s College of Arts and Sciences, the group delved into optimism and pessimism and how those mindsets influence well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group utilized data from the Health and Retirement Study, a large-scale panel study that gathers a nationally representative sample of Americans aged 50 and older (Sonnega et al., 2014).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, participants responded to questions assessing their levels of optimism, such as “In uncertain times, I usually expect the best,” and pessimism, such as “I hardly ever expect things to go my way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the COVID-19 pandemic (between March and May 2020), respondents answered questions on health-related behaviors that either increased or reduced the risk of COVID transmission, including masking frequency, travel habits and the likelihood of staying home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used this data to explore how people’s mindsets affected their psychological and physical well-being during challenging times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among their findings, they found that greater optimism promotes resilience and well-being when faced with stressors like the pandemic, while lower pessimism is linked to safer health behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings appeared in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Research in Personality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the following Q&amp;amp;A, Professor Jeewon Oh shares some key insights from their research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the motivation for this study?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeewon Oh (JO): The pandemic introduced many changes, and we wanted to know more about personality traits that can help people cope with enduring and uncontrollable stressors like the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined optimism, because it motivates action. Since optimists view stressful situations positively, they are more likely to directly address the issue or try to adapt when things are uncontrollable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were the benefits for those who were more optimistic? How did optimism/pessimism correlate with well-being during the pandemic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(JO): Both optimism and pessimism had independent associations with psychological well-being. So, people who are more optimistic and less pessimistic worried less, were less stressed and lonely and were more resilient. This was partly because these people engaged in more physical activity and perceived more social support and less strain from their relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, when it came to COVID/health-relevant behaviors, pessimism played a significant role, but optimism didn’t. In other words, individuals with a less pessimistic mindset (but not a more optimistic mindset), who have weaker negative expectations tended to engage in less risky behaviors, such as traveling, and more activities at home ranging from watching TV and gardening to meditating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does optimism or pessimism influence the way people approach challenges and setbacks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(JO): In general, regular optimism/pessimism isn’t about thinking they wouldn’t get sick, or they will be more likely to get sick (compared to others), but about knowing the reality and still thinking that things will eventually work out. This positive mindset helps people to problem-solve and cope. Afterall, if you think things would never work out, why would you even try?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a way to boost one’s optimism during times when they may be more anxious, like during the pandemic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(JO): It can be easier to think about doing what optimists do rather than trying to think differently (or change your optimism). So, people with lower pessimism mentioned changing their behaviors to adapt to the situation, meeting with people on Zoom more frequently and exercising at home (vs. going to the gym and meeting up with people in person). It was these changes in behaviors like exercising more that partly helped people’s well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this study reveal about health and psychological well-being in the post-pandemic world? What factors can we consider for maintaining and improving mental health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(JO): There has been evidence before the pandemic that optimistic people fare well in many situations. Even though more research is needed to understand why, our study found that optimists fared better even during new difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, developing optimism and learning how to flexibly cope can help maintain and improve mental health in diverse situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a4c0d0c6c1d6cac5d6e4d7ddd68ac1c0d1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Daniel Bernardi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://syr.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Syracuse University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Daniel Bernardi – Syracuse University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2024.104541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Optimism and pessimism were prospectively associated with adaptation during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;” by Jeewon Oh et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Research in Personality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimism and pessimism were prospectively associated with adaptation during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study, we examined the association between optimism/pessimism before the pandemic and adaptation during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, optimism was associated with behaviors that reduce COVID-19 transmission and higher psychological well-being (βs&amp;gt;|.196|) through changes in social contacts (indirect effect βs&amp;gt; |.004|) and/or increases in physical activity (βs=|.01|).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separating optimism and pessimism, we found that only pessimism was associated with behaviors that reduce risk, but &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; optimism and pessimism were associated with psychological well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By investigating them in the context of new public health challenges, we found that while the presence of optimism and absence of pessimism may both be resources for well-being, the absence of pessimism may be particularly important for health-relevant behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 21:27:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1MUU1BN0lXck0tUVNjd2d3bzZBT0dHNWV6UTdWUmZEYldQRktWT0RBNVFudDJmcUhsRUwxcXJMdWFEZ0hRMmxjVHBfb0VzU0VWbFVnZ0xKV0lmWVoya0x4MHdxaXN4MERNOWRaOGdFUUNyNHc</guid></item><item><title>What happens when you diet by removing ultra-processed foods?

These guidelines do not mention ultra-processed foods (UPFs), even though they are linked to serious health risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chips, candy, and other mass-produced &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-tool-lets-you-check-how-processed-your-food-is-grocerydb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;packaged foods&lt;/a&gt; often replace natural ingredients with additives. Studies show eating UPFs increases the risk of diseases and early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these risks, no major dietary programs focus on reducing UPF intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, researchers from &lt;a href="https://drexel.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Drexel University&lt;/a&gt; designed an intervention. The goal was to help people eat fewer ultra-processed foods using multiple strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-ultra-processed-foods-the-basics"&gt;Understanding ultra-processed foods – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are the heavily modified, lab-created stuff you find in most grocery store aisles – think packaged snacks, sugary cereals, instant noodles, and even some protein bars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They go through multiple industrial processes, packed with additives like preservatives, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/artificial-sweetener-neotame-has-shocking-effects-on-gut-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;artificial flavors&lt;/a&gt;, emulsifiers, and loads of sugar or refined oils. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These foods are designed to be super convenient, hyper-palatable, and have a long shelf life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the catch: they often lack real nutrition and can mess with your metabolism, gut health, and even brain chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies link them to everything from obesity and diabetes to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/artificial-sweetener-erythritol-sugar-substitute-linked-to-blood-clots-heart-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and even mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is, ultra-processed foods are everywhere, and they’re marketed as quick, tasty, and sometimes even “healthy” options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But because they’re engineered for taste and texture, they can be addictive, making it easy to overeat without feeling full. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, their ingredient lists often look more like a chemistry experiment than actual food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reducing-ultra-processed-food-intake"&gt;Reducing ultra-processed food intake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Drexel University program went beyond education. It included mindfulness strategies to handle cravings, one-on-one meal planning, and household involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also provided financial support to help participants buy healthier foods, which can be expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two-month intervention involved 14 adults with overweight or obesity who ate at least two UPF items daily. On average, participants cut their UPF intake by nearly half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reducing UPF intake can be extremely difficult, because the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ultra-processed-foods-make-our-bodies-age-faster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; industry wants us to be hooked on UPFs,” said lead author Dr. Charlotte Hagerman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The industry designs UPFs to be ultra-delicious, convenient, cheap, and constantly present in the U.S. – even if not directly in front of us, then on our TVs, phones, and roadside signs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-promising-results-from-the-intervention"&gt;Promising results from the intervention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the small sample size, the results of the trial were encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the program, participants had nearly halved their UPF &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-ultra-processed-foods-makes-your-muscles-weaker-and-more-fragile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;intake&lt;/a&gt;, measured both in calories and total items consumed. They also reduced their daily calorie intake by more than 600 calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar consumption declined by 50 percent, while saturated fat intake dropped by 37 percent. Sodium intake also saw a significant decrease of 28 percent. On average, participants lost 7.7 pounds over the two-month period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, participants did not have meaningful increases in their fruit and vegetable consumption, suggesting that if we want to improve dietary intake more holistically, we may need to more strongly encourage people to eat these foods,” said Hagerman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-intervention-worked"&gt;How the intervention worked&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants met weekly with health behavior coaches in both group and individual sessions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They learned how to identify UPFs, cope with cravings, and improve their home food environment. Each participant received a $100 grocery store gift card to support healthier purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To track progress, the participants completed detailed food intake reports. They documented everything they ate on selected weekdays and weekends using a specialized assessment tool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers classified foods as UPFs or non-UPFs, consulting experts when needed to avoid bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-psychological-benefits-of-cutting-upfs"&gt;Psychological benefits of cutting UPFs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond physical health, the participants noticed mental and emotional benefits. Many reported feeling better overall, with improvements in mood and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ultra-processed-foods-are-harmful-to-nearly-every-part-of-the-body/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since UPFs can trigger addiction-like behaviors, reducing intake may help regulate emotions and improve mental clarity. Cutting back on UPFs also seemed to help participants feel more in control of their eating habits, making it easier to maintain a healthier diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By addressing both the physical and psychological aspects of food choices, the program helped participants develop a healthier relationship with eating. This could be crucial for long-term success in maintaining dietary changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-for-research"&gt;Next steps for research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings suggest that people can reduce their ultra-processed food intake, if given the proper tools, and that they will be enthusiastic about interventions designed for this purpose,” said Hagerman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results also suggest that reducing UPF intake will lead to meaningful health improvements – such as weight loss and better mood – in as short as eight weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team plans to expand the study. Future work will test the intervention on a larger sample and evaluate which strategies are most effective. The researchers also want to see if the program works across different populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-bigger-picture"&gt;The bigger picture&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study highlights the need for better public awareness and policies to reduce UPF consumption. Since UPFs dominate the food supply, long-term solutions should address accessibility and affordability of healthier alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Education, financial incentives, and community-based programs could help more people reduce their UPF intake. As research continues, these findings may shape new approaches to improving public health through better nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/osp4.70029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Obesity Science &amp;amp; Practice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 21:24:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQZzlvY1Ayb1dobWxfZDRmYjByU0tobVBpQUdXTkJWT29vR21nS2pKM3RiNG1fcWs4Z2tkTnJFWEZ4cGZ2Rl85YlVuSHZLWWcwRjhicW5hOGFzR2RkTndjZUhnXzY2SThVM3lTdHBHbkQzUWY2dlRwVFBOT1J3LTZJUWN3SnUxS1pmS0VSbnl5S3ZlQmswQWJ3UklvcWRmbFNC</guid></item><item><title>Disease-carrying pest boom may invade San Antonio this spring, study says - San Antonio Express-News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPOVkwWG1WSkhhemxOYVlXZkNJc1g3eVBQUW9qVEdycm9SUTRxYkFWdUU3OWVCNXk0NUNRRkl5d25lMHh3WHppdks2YW9COHBSLUw2RkUzR0tuZlEycUtBSk4wd3k1OXdaRkg5OVQzczMyUWZVRWNTeTNta0VJdTJ0Ry1NY0xjdGwxVDRHYXdPTWpxLWtxcVg2ZngtMFhSOVRBWEFr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

The research, which was published in the British Dental Journal Open, used advanced CT scans to analyze the skulls of 15 Viking-era individuals. It found evidence of chronic ailments that would have made their lives much harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_47777" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-47777" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img data-lazyloaded="1" src="" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-47777" data-src="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-1.jpg" alt="CT scans of Viking-age skulls reveal widespread disease" data-srcset="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-1.jpg 1280w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-1-1024x769.jpg 1024w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-1-768x577.jpg 768w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-1-150x113.jpg 150w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-1-750x563.jpg 750w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-1-1140x856.jpg 1140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-47777" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Skull mounted in the CT-scanner. Credit: C. Bertilsson et al. BDJ Open (2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on adults between the ages of 20 and 60. Results showed that many suffered from severe dental and maxillofacial diseases, including dental caries, periodontal disease, and periapical infections. The scans also uncovered signs of sinus and ear infections, osteoarthritis, and other skeletal conditions. This research suggests that these health problems were common and might have lasted for long periods because people back then didn’t have antibiotics or modern medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carolina Bertilsson, the lead researcher and an assistant professor at the University of Gothenburg, said: “The results of the study provide greater understanding of these people’s health and wellbeing. Everyone knows what it’s like to have pain somewhere, you can get quite desperate for help. But back then, they didn’t have the medical and dental care we do, or the kind of pain relief – and antibiotics – we now have. If you developed an infection, it could stick around for a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research builds on earlier studies examining the dental health of a larger group of Viking-age individuals from Varnhem, a historic site in Sweden’s Västergötland province known for its well-preserved ancient graves. While past studies focused on teeth, this new study went further by analyzing entire skulls with CT scans. This allowed the team to identify skeletal changes that may have been missed during conventional examinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_47780" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-47780" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-2-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img data-lazyloaded="1" src="" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-47780" data-src="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-2-1.jpg" alt="CT scans of Viking-age skulls reveal widespread disease" data-srcset="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-2-1.jpg 1280w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-2-1-300x248.jpg 300w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-2-1-1024x847.jpg 1024w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-2-1-768x635.jpg 768w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-2-1-150x124.jpg 150w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-2-1-750x621.jpg 750w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-2-1-1140x943.jpg 1140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-47780" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cyst of tooth 36, individual 12. Credit: C. Bertilsson et al. BDJ Open (2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;CT imaging provided a non-invasive way to examine the remains, preserving them while extracting detailed medical information. “Very many of today’s archaeological methods are invasive, with the need to remove bone or other tissue for analysis. This way, we can keep the remains completely intact yet still extract a great deal of information,” Bertilsson said. The method helped detect bone alterations linked to chronic infections, such as sclerotization of the mastoid process, infection-induced periosteal bone deposition, and sinusitis-related bone changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research involved collaboration with experts in dental radiology and an archaeologist from Västergötlands Museum. The researchers plan to expand on these results in future studies using CT scans to analyze a larger sample size and compare results with other Viking-age populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bertilsson, C., Borg, E., Vretemark, M. et al.

For individuals over 65, long-term use of ibuprofen increases the risk of stomach ulcers, which is why doctors may recommend additional medication to protect the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NHS also highlights potential interactions between ibuprofen and other medications. Blood thinners such as warfarin can increase the risk of bleeding when taken with ibuprofen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other NSAIDs, including aspirin, should not be taken alongside it, as this can amplify side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain antibiotics, antidepressants, and diabetes medications may also interact negatively with ibuprofen, affecting their effectiveness or leading to unwanted complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ibuprofen can be safely taken with paracetamol or codeine, the NHS advises against combining it with herbal supplements like ginkgo biloba, as this can further increase the risk of bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these warnings in mind, the NHS urges people to take ibuprofen responsibly and to consult a doctor or pharmacist if they have any concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the painkiller is widely available and effective, it is essential to recognize the risks and ensure it is suitable for individual health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any of the warning symptoms occur, switching to an alternative pain relief option, such as paracetamol, may be a safer choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Express</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 18:25:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOTFQ4RUswZUhlaElTOEstV2JtVC1zVTB4eW01eHZjMklZTWwzSmE3NGxTMTBQTkM5eVA0OXJKY1N1MFBjQmhrZ2tZMG93RlgtaEZrWkdhUG5mS19NVUMycDJER3NjbG1qRmI1d1B4YUQ4eXl0a2dQMFdEc2lRdVZVbGd2TG1oYlRkQVVxdWRLb9IBlAFBVV95cUxOSU15REpuWnEtbmZ1OERmeGpvbEx1aUlPeHZZbGxZeUZoNkdCbVMxbmFLN25NNFhzUGZYZVI3WUlJcUhKZE1Sc0NQMDN4WlFjWG8ySFk3UzVmWjkyLUc0UTh1SGJsZm5rRTlLWnJ1SlhzbTlfUFBRV2F6QktVNnBfWmpVTUY1NmpwYm1yendMdXdsQU4z</guid></item><item><title>Popular diet followed by Joe Rogan can cause painful kidney stones, experts warn — and that’s not all - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxPZXpmdjRKQXNaejg2X092T1hDb3ZJQU9aRmRYelJ0OVhudkg1SFR5WktvcTJMT1JzdWZFT1RBRW45NEJlWlhJMHJxMHpMbVY3TVZ6cjFBaUJsUl9JYUFPYnEwZEJMaHNJeWJWVVhZLTctUXBpMUxBMmlDSG5NdkJPdktyc3doX3d4d25DRXpsM3FkQWdOMWV5ZmxkRjQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;We’ve all scoured the internet for weight loss secrets. But just because the scale drops doesn’t mean your body’s on board.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just look at the carnivore diet. The eating plan — which involves consuming only animal byproducts such as meat, eggs and dairy — has taken off among &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/02/health/influencer-swears-by-carnivore-diet-but-experts-are-not-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;fitness influencers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/11/health/influencer-lost-30-lbs-on-diet-of-butter-meat-golden-jello/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;across the internet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Devotees of the high protein, no-vegetable lifestyle swear it’s a game-changer for weight loss and overall health. Podcaster &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/tag/joe-rogan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Joe Rogan&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://routines.club/routine/the-joe-rogan-carnivore-diet" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;among the faithful&lt;/a&gt;, recently returning to the diet even after his first stint left him with &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a30675936/joe-rogan-carnivore-diet-diarrhoea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;explosive diarrhea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;While most kidney stones can pass naturally, the process can be incredibly painful. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Peakstock – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Podcasting giant Joe Rogan has publicly touted the carnivore diet.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But experts are sounding the alarm. Many have raised concerns about the diet’s &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/critical-thinking-student-contributors-health-and-nutrition/taking-bite-out-carnivore-diet" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;nutritional gaps&lt;/a&gt;, and now doctors from the Indiana University School of Medicine are warning that the carnivore diet could also increase the risk of painful kidney stones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These hard deposits, made up of minerals and salts, form in the kidneys due to diet, weight, and other factors. Most people can pass kidney stones naturally, though it can be incredibly painful. Depending on their size, they can block the flow of urine, leading to potentially life-threatening infections and the risk of sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;In a recent case study published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916524014199" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, doctors revealed that a 68-year-old man adopted the carnivore diet after discovering it on YouTube — only to suffer serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While he lost 24 pounds eating 90% meat products, tests conducted six months later showed his body was already forming kidney stones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Urine analysis revealed he had an increased risk of developing all three major types of kidney stones — calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, and uric acid — with levels “consistent with stone growth.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A year after quitting the diet, the doctors reported that the patient was kidney stone-free. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="single__inline-module inline-module inline-module--newsletter aligncenter aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-newsletter" data-source-unit="Inline Newsletter Module Post Care"&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They pointed to the patient’s results as evidence of the “potential hazards of the carnivore diet,” noting that it creates the “optimal environment” for kidney stone development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The lack of literature on this and other fad diets’ safety and efficacy should be a cause for alarm among physicians,” the doctors wrote. They recommended a fiber- and carbohydrate-rich diet to support gut bacteria and help prevent kidney stone formation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The medical community remains divided on the carnivore diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Red meat consumption has been linked to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and even some cancers.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;bit24 – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some doctors have &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/is-the-carnivore-diet-bad-for-cholesterol#1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;raised concerns&lt;/a&gt; about the eating plan’s impact on cardiovascular health. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/20/health/red-and-processed-meats-linked-to-type-2-diabetes-risk-new-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Red meat&lt;/a&gt;, butter, and cheese are &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/20/health/red-and-processed-meats-linked-to-type-2-diabetes-risk-new-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;high in saturated fats&lt;/a&gt;, which can elevate levels of “bad” cholesterol in the blood, increasing the risk of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/04/health/61-of-us-adults-will-have-cardiovascular-disease-by-2050-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/21/lifestyle/how-to-prevent-a-stroke-stroke-association-issues-new-advice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While cutting back on &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/11/health/influencer-lost-30-lbs-on-diet-of-butter-meat-golden-jello/#:~:text=decrease%20intake%20of%20sugary" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sugary and refined carbs&lt;/a&gt; is generally a good idea, fruits and vegetables are a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/11/health/influencer-lost-30-lbs-on-diet-of-butter-meat-golden-jello/#:~:text=fruits%20and%20vegetables%20are%20a%20rich%20source%20of%20fiber%20and%20essential%20nutrients" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;rich source of fiber and essential nutrients&lt;/a&gt; that can help lower the risk of chronic diseases, manage blood pressure, aid in weight management and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/11/health/influencer-lost-30-lbs-on-diet-of-butter-meat-golden-jello/#:~:text=weight%20management%20and-,improve%20digestion,-." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;improve digestion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;And let’s not forget the side effects. When Rogan first tried the diet for a month in 2020, the podcasting giant said he lost weight and saw significant improvements in his energy levels and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s really only one ‘bad’ thing, and that thing is diarrhea,” Rogan wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/joerogan/p/B7LPdnHlto7/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2020 Instagram post&lt;/a&gt;. “I’ve come to accept that if I keep going with this diet it’s just a matter of time before we lose a battle, and I fill my undies like a rainforest mudslide overtaking a mountain road.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While diarrhea might be embarrassing, one Florida man’s symptoms were &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/24/health/bizarre-side-effect-of-extreme-carnivore-diet-leaves-mans-hands-covered-in-yellow-nodes/"&gt;downright bizarre&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After eating nothing but butter, cheese and hamburger patties for eight months, he showed up at a Tampa hospital with ooze leaking from yellowish nodes on the palms of his hands, elbows and the soles of his feet. Doctors later diagnosed him with xanthelasma, a condition caused by high cholesterol or excess fats in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cardiologists diagnosed the Florida man with xanthelasma, a condition caused by high cholesterol levels or other fats in the blood. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;JAMA Cardiologym 2024, Marmagkiolis et al&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Still, some experts argue the carnivore diet might benefit certain individuals. A few studies have identified positive outcomes, including a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2475299122106086?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2021 Harvard study&lt;/a&gt; that found “high levels of satisfaction and improvements in overall health, well-being, and various medical conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Georgia Ede, a Harvard-trained, board-certified psychiatrist specializing in nutritional and metabolic psychiatry, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/10/health/expert-shatters-myths-about-the-carnivore-diet-and-the-real-impact-it-has-on-your-health/"&gt;told Fox News&lt;/a&gt; she has found the carnivore diet to be an “indispensable tool” in her clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s not possible to say with scientific certainty whether this dietary pattern (or any dietary pattern, for that matter) is ideal for everyone, but my clinical and personal experience tell me that a well-formulated carnivore diet can be uniquely healing for some of us,” Ede said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She noted that the diet could help identify food sensitivities, resolve chronic constipation and IBS symptoms, curb food addiction and binge-eating, and break weight loss plateaus.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, researchers at &lt;a href="https://ki.se/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Karolinska Institutet&lt;/a&gt; in Sweden have identified a fourth: breathing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery, published in &lt;a href="https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1113/JP287205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Journal of Physiology&lt;/a&gt;, shows that pupils are smallest during inhalation and largest during exhalation, revealing a fundamental mechanism that could influence vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like a camera’s aperture, the pupil controls the amount of light that enters the eye. Changes in its size can affect how the world appears, sharpening details or enhancing the ability to detect faint objects. The newly discovered breathing-linked pupil fluctuation suggests that vision might subtly shift throughout each breath, alternating between clarity and sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This mechanism is unique in that it is cyclical, ever-present, and requires no external stimulus,” says Artin Arshamian, an associate professor at the Department of Clinical Neuroscience at Karolinska Institutet. “Since breathing affects brain activity and cognitive functions, the discovery may contribute to a better understanding of how our vision and attention are regulated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Abstract figure. Across five experiments including 203 participants and a wide range of experimental conditions researchers demonstrate that pupil size fluctuates in a systematic manner over the course of the breathing cycle. (CREDIT: The Journal of Physiology) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_brain_s_role_in_synchronizing_breath_and_vision"&gt;The Brain’s Role in Synchronizing Breath and Vision&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research builds on growing evidence that respiration does more than just oxygenate the body. It generates neural oscillations—rhythmic electrical activity in the brain—that influence cognition and perception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These oscillations stem from the preBötzinger complex, a &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/humans-may-actually-have-a-one-track-mind-after-all-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cluster of neurons&lt;/a&gt; in the brainstem that regulates breathing. They also arise from the olfactory bulb when air moves through the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past studies in animals have shown that these respiration-linked oscillations help synchronize sensory and motor behaviors like sniffing, whisking, and head movement. Similarly, pupil size plays a vital role in vision, influencing how the brain processes visual information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, direct evidence linking respiration to pupil changes remained elusive, with past research yielding inconsistent results due to small sample sizes and methodological flaws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To clarify this connection, researchers at Karolinska Institutet conducted five carefully controlled experiments with over 200 participants. Their findings confirmed that breathing consistently influenced pupil size across various conditions, whether participants were breathing quickly or slowly, through the nose or mouth, in bright or dim lighting, at rest, or engaged in visual tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking results was that the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/lifechanging-new-eye-drops-can-make-reading-glasses-obsolete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pupil fluctuations&lt;/a&gt; occurred even in individuals born without an olfactory bulb, a brain structure typically associated with nasal breathing. This suggests that the brainstem alone may regulate the effect, highlighting its deep evolutionary roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="how_pupil_changes_may_shape_perception"&gt;How Pupil Changes May Shape Perception&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study raises intriguing possibilities about how vision shifts in response to breathing. Pupil size directly affects how light enters the eye, influencing visual acuity. A smaller pupil, like a camera lens set to a narrow aperture, enhances sharpness and depth of field, making it easier to see fine details. A larger pupil, by contrast, allows more light to enter, improving sensitivity to dim or distant objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Polar plots of participants’ pupil sizes over the course of the breathing cycle. 0° (Inh) marks the onset of inhalation, 90° marks peak inhalation, 180° (Exh) marks the onset of exhalation, and 270° marks peak exhalation.

Tasks requiring high visual precision, such as reading or threading a needle, might be easier when inhaling. Meanwhile, scanning for movement in low light, such as spotting a shadow at night, might be enhanced during exhalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="potential_applications_in_medicine_and_neuroscience"&gt;Potential Applications in Medicine and Neuroscience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond its effects on vision, the link between respiration and pupil size may have medical applications. The autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary bodily functions, regulates both breathing and pupil response.

While rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors remained steady within both heterosexual and LGBQ groups of girls, the overall rise in female suicidality appears linked to the increase in girls identifying as LGBQ, a group that historically faces greater social pressures and mental health challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that a substantial number of teenage girls have seriously considered suicide, made suicide plans, or attempted suicide in recent years. This increase has prompted examination into potential contributing factors, and the researchers aimed to explore a connection between this trend and the simultaneous increase in the number of girls identifying as LGBQ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has consistently shown that LGBQ youth experience higher rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors compared to their heterosexual peers. The new study sought to determine if the rise in overall suicidality among girls could be explained, at least in part, by a larger proportion of students now identifying as part of a more vulnerable population. Furthermore, the researchers wanted to compare these trends with those of male students, among whom changes in LGBQ identification have been less pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recent reports of rising suicidality among teenage girls caught our attention, but we noticed that discussions weren’t fully considering an important demographic shift occurring simultaneously – the significant increase in female students identifying as LGBQ. Given the well-documented higher rates of suicidality among LGBQ youth, we wanted to investigate whether these parallel trends might be connected,” explained study author Joseph Cimpian, a professor of economics and education policy at New York University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct their study, the researchers analyzed data from the national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) collected in 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2021. The YRBS is a survey of high school students in grades 9 through 12 across the United States that collects data on health risk behaviors. The sample included 22,562 female and 22,130 male students who responded to questions about their sexual identity and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The survey asked students to identify their sexual orientation (heterosexual or LGBQ) and whether they had experienced suicidal thoughts, made suicide plans, or attempted suicide in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used statistical methods to analyze the data and examine trends in LGBQ identification and suicidality among both female and male students. They used logistic regression to predict LGBQ identification by year. They also used logistic regression to examine suicidality outcomes by year and tested for interactions between sexual identity and year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see if the changes in LGBQ identification could statistically explain the rise in suicidality among girls, they adjusted the suicidality rates to account for the changes in LGBQ identification over time. They also used an algorithm to account for potentially mischievous responses from students who might have provided invalid data. Finally, they looked at trends separately for White students and students of color to see if there were different patterns across racial and ethnic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found a substantial increase in the proportion of high school girls identifying as LGBQ between 2015 and 2021. In 2015, about 15% of female students identified as LGBQ, but by 2021, this number had risen to 34%. This represents a significant increase. In contrast, the percentage of male students identifying as LGBQ showed only a small increase, from 6% in 2015 to 9% in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that suicidal thoughts, suicide plans, and suicide attempts were significantly higher among female students in 2021 compared to previous years. However, when they analyzed the data separately for LGBQ and heterosexual females, they found that the rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors remained stable within each group. LGBQ females consistently reported higher rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors compared to heterosexual females, but there was no notable increase or decrease in these rates over time within the LGBQ group. This suggests that the increase in overall suicidality among females was primarily driven by the increasing number of girls identifying as LGBQ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers adjusted the overall suicidality rates to account for changes in LGBQ identification, the significant differences in suicidality rates among females in 2021 compared to other years disappeared. In other words, once the researchers accounted for the fact that more girls identified as LGBQ in 2021, there were no longer significant differences in suicidality rates among females across the years. These patterns remained the same even after accounting for potentially mischievous and invalid responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were struck by how consistent the rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors are when looking just among heterosexual girls or just among LGBQ girls,” Cimpian told PsyPost. “That is, the much-reported trends of increasing suicidality among girls as a whole are not found when looking within just heterosexual or just LGBQ girls. ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For males, the researchers found minimal changes in suicidality after adjusting for LGBQ identification. As expected, the small increase in male LGBQ identification did little to explain the trends in male suicidality. Both White and students of color showed similar trends, including rising LGBQ identification and the lack of significant suicidality differences after accounting for sexual identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While overall female suicidality increased between 2015 and 2021, we found that rates remained stable within both LGBQ and heterosexual groups separately – suggesting that the overall increase stems from more students being part of a group (LGBQ) that has historically experienced higher suicide risk due to social and structural pressures,” Cimpian explained. “This finding indicates that addressing rising suicidality among teenage girls requires focusing on supporting LGBQ youth specifically, rather than assuming all girls are becoming more suicidal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as with all research, there are some limitations to consider. The survey data only included binary sex categories (female and male) and did not measure gender identity. This means the researchers could not examine any patterns for transgender youth. Future research could continue to monitor trends in suicidality among LGBQ youth and examine the factors that contribute to their increased risk. The research team hopes to gain a better understanding of the ways in which school policies and the broader social climate contribute to the mental health outcomes of students with diverse sexual identities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We plan to examine how school policies and resources affect outcomes for LGBQ students, particularly as many states consider legislation affecting LGBTQ+ youth in schools,” Cimpian said. “We’re also interested in understanding how intersecting identities and school climate factors influence student wellbeing and mental health outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/0013189X241305329" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;An Overlooked Explanation for Increasing Suicidality: LGBQ Stressors Felt by More Students&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Joseph R.

They may well be sabotaging your heart health, new research suggests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As detailed in a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651324014593#sec0150" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;span&gt;recent study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; published in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a team of Chinese researchers found that rats that were given water &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;that'd been boiled and then stored in common takeout lids showed significant disruptions in the gut biome, including inflammation — a common risk factor for cardiovascular disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In many cases, they also observed extensive damage to myocardial tissue, or heart muscle. The work is the latest to highlight the alarming toll that &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/brains-microplastics-study" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;exposure to ubiquitous microplastics&lt;/a&gt; can have on the body — and how &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/children-dying-chemicals-plastics" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;easily it can seep into our food and beverages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The data revealed that high-frequency exposure to plastics is significantly associated with an increased risk of congestive heart failure," the authors wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Besides a control group, the rats were divided into three groups that drank boiled water &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;that'd been exposed to the plastic takeout containers — known as leachate — for one minute, five minutes, and fifteen minutes respectively. They drank this regularly for three months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Surprisingly, no single rat pack stood out; they all roughly exhibited the same degree of worrying symptoms, like changes to the composition of their intestinal microbacteria and damage to the heart muscle. This suggests that any amount of exposure could put you at risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The study shows plastic exposure as a significant [cardiovascular disease] risk factor regardless of duration," the author wrote. "It leads to changes in myocardial tissue, gut microbiota, and metabolites, all closely tied to [cardiovascular disease]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Along with the rat experiment, the team also surveyed nearly 3,200 people in China with self-reported questionnaires about how often they were exposed to plastics and about symptoms related to their cardiovascular health. This is flimsier stuff than the rat trials, but nonetheless, it found that frequent plastic exposure was linked to a higher risk of heart failure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are, however, some notable limitations to the study. Regarding the human survey, that there was a correlation between plastic exposure and heart failure may be due to "individual differences within the surveyed population," the authors wrote, noting that only exposure within the past month was investigated. No biological samples were taken from the human respondents, either.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As for the rats, the scientists weren't able to measure the amount of and kinds of plastic particles in their bodies. And while there was notable damage to myocardial tissue, none of the rodents exhibited full-blown cardiovascular disease. Still, this may be because of the short nature of the experiment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Further research is necessary to elucidate the health impacts of long-term exposure to plastic products, as well as the accumulation and distribution of plastic particles in tissues and organs, to provide a theoretical foundation for the development of appropriate safety measures in the future," the authors conclude.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the meantime? They suggest avoid using plastic takeout containers for hot food.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on plastics: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/microplastics-brain-vessels-clots-mice-scientists" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Microplastics Getting Stuck in Brain Vessels Like Clots, Scientists Find, Causing "Neurological Abnormalities" in Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 17:00:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTFBuai1iMVFSNWhiRGgxcGZJc3JqUExTTlR5RzBGMjdScEF1RF95N1hKS2VfY0pla3lZaE9fTGFQbFA0YjhOcUVfbVIteTVEaGRKRDNZb29UOUdtTHllalFnVnpSM0NmMGhocnZ3</guid></item><item><title>The sticky, slippery promise of castor oil packs - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE5RR1Frc01tVTdKQ3BEdXhKaklReWJWa2M0SFBCYjlHa3lqcURkQXhWYlc0anhVdTQ0M0p4TkwtQ2REdnNNeGxoY0pZZ2hBaXBUSnIzWVpJMG9hZ0p0TGttSTZRc3dEQjQ4UjBvdTVlbThYejBJU2djZmdfNHFKMWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZEEFBFFS6JFIDCEVWFM6UBFQE4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Before she goes to bed, Lisa Brezinski slathers on a thick, sticky layer of castor oil — often on her stomach, but sometimes on her neck or over her upper abdomen.

Daniel Ricciardi, a pharmacist, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGewmt38FoU" target="_blank"&gt;said in a YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; that “a lot of evidence [on castor oil packs] just does not exist right now, and there’s not a huge incentive for Pharma companies to fund a lot of studies for castor oil.” He noted that skin irritation and allergic reactions are possible but that using castor oil is “relatively safe if not ingested orally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4Z4HX73J5FHQHC7MMKYBNDMGLQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drrubainadang.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Rubaina Dang&lt;/a&gt;, a naturopathic doctor, said castor oil packs are “one of the oldest old-school tricks in the book.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GEWBWOW6VVGJVPYCIXRRDW6Z6U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For her patients with hormonal imbalances and digestive issues, she prescribes castor oil packs to help with symptom relief. She tells those with painful periods to either soak a piece of cloth in castor oil or roll the castor oil onto their abdomen or uterus area, apply another cloth over it, and then put a heating pad over that. She advises her patients to do this 3 to 5 times per week for about 30 to 60 minutes. She said there’s no exact recommendation for using castor oil packs and people need to find what works best for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QYHPYT3O6ZB5NDMT5W4CKHIGEI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Dang said castor oil may lead to uterine contractions, so people should not use it during their menstrual cycle, if they are pregnant or breastfeeding. She also said not to use it on an open wound or if you are dealing with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis flare-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YMXVQBDMXZE73FOMTPRKFNFGOM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Beyond internal benefits, castor oil can clear your skin, Dang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P45ONOG5GND6ZCP4VUUB5V2ZJ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The liver plays a big role in skin health,” she&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;explained. The liver processes hormones and filters toxins, but when it’s sluggish, that excess waste doesn’t clear properly, leading to acne and rashes. “By supporting the body’s elimination pathways, like digestion and regular bowel movements, castor oil indirectly improves skin health,” Dang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="E7FFYCKWCRABRFSI5BMOUEHQ3Y" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="E7FFYCKWCRABRFSI5BMOUEHQ3Y"&gt;A nightly ritual&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VYFOI6PBU5GO5KUF2JTOTTBEF4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Not everyone opts for a full-on castor oil pack. &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ameliarrmei?_t=ZT-8tfHWk6wNtm&amp;amp;_r=1" target="_blank"&gt;Amelia Mei &lt;/a&gt;stumbled across one of her favorite influencers on Instagram raving about castor oil for bloating.

According to new research, a large part of the ancient Norse lifestyle also involved being struck down by oral and maxillofacial diseases, many of which would likely have caused immense pain and suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The study authors used computed tomography (CT) to scan the skulls of 15 individuals from the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/oldest-viking-legal-text-written-in-runes-on-an-iron-hoop-reveals-new-insights-75559" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Viking Age&lt;/a&gt; cemetery Varnhem in Sweden, with the resulting images examined by dentists and facial pathologists in order to diagnose any ailments and afflictions. Dated to between the tenth and twelfth centuries CE, the owners of the ancient crania turned out to be in surprisingly bad shape, and appear to have suffered from a range of severe infections and other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For instance, 80 percent of specimens showed evidence of a particularly painful oral pathology called apical periodontitis, which is typically caused by bacterial infection of the tooth canal. Some of these individuals even appear to have undergone a rudimentary dental treatment which involved opening a hole in the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/vikings-may-have-modified-their-teeth-as-a-kind-of-initiation-73640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;tooth&lt;/a&gt; to access the pulp, and which one imagines must have been absolutely excruciating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A further three skulls showed signs of chronic sinusitis, which the researchers say probably led to “nasal obstruction, sensation of facial pressure or fullness, nasal discharge and olfactory loss.” Other specimens contained bony growths that are likely to have been produced by infections in the ears and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Cartilage-covered growths along the joints of the jaw, meanwhile, were interpreted as signs of rheumatoid arthritis in some of the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/did-vikings-have-tattoos-real-norse-body-art-is-filled-with-mystery-68036" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Viking&lt;/a&gt; skulls. Summing up their findings, the authors state that “the individuals in this early Christian community may have suffered from numerous orofacial pathologies, including sinusitis, otitis, and infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Commenting on these results in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074488" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, study author Carolina Bertilsson said that “everyone knows what it's like to have pain somewhere, you can get quite desperate for help. But back then, they didn't have the medical and dental care we do, or the kind of pain relief – and antibiotics – we now have. If you developed an infection, it could stick around for a long time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In addition to causing relentless agony, these untreatable illnesses also had the potential to escalate from mere discomfort to incredibly serious conditions, with devastating outcomes.

However, he still fully understood what was going on around him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not only was he suffering from a brain condition, but he also developed 'locked in syndrome,' &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14410285/Scientists-capture-end-life-brain-activity-prove-humans-souls.html"&gt;a coma in which a person can't move or talk&lt;/a&gt; but is still conscious.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His condition was severe and deemed terminal. Doctors believed there was nothing they could do for him so he was sent home, where he said his family didn't realize he was still aware of his surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While trapped in his body, Mr Haendel heard nurses call him 'brain dead' and a family member say he would likely die soon, but the most shocking thing he heard was an argument between his father and then-wife, which ended in a violent altercation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jake Haendel detailed his journey with acute toxic leukoencephalopathy (ATL) on his TikTok, Instagram and a new podcast&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel's ordeal began in May 2017. He was newly married and the head executive chef at a restaurant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One day, he noticed 'I kind of felt weird.' He had a higher pitched voice than normal, &lt;span&gt;his balance was unsteady and he swerving while driving. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ellen, now his ex wife, told him he should go to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He went to the emergency department and was admitted with stroke-like symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I still thought I would go home and it would be like any other time I was in the hospital... b&lt;span&gt;ut life would definitely never be the same.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time morning came, eight doctors surrounded Mr Haendel's bed with 'somber looks' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said doctors told him: 'We're so sorry you have six months to live. You have an extremely rare brain disease.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel, now 36 and a Boston resident, was diagnosed with acute toxic leukoencephalopathy (ATL), a condition that damages &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-13751285/husband-suffered-brain-injury-flung-motorbike-headfirst.html"&gt;brain regions that help with communication and body movements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel's condition specifically was acute toxic progressive leukoencephalopathy (ATPL), with 'progressive' indicating his symptoms were quickly worsening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This caused 'locked in syndrome.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors told him his symptoms would get worse very quickly, taking away his ability to walk and confining him to a wheelchair. After that, his body would contract and he'd be in 'a lot of pain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then would lose the ability to eat, swallow and talk. Eventually he would need tubes to breath and a feeding tube to get nutrients 'until you slip into a coma and likely die.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was told there was no chance he would get better:&lt;span&gt; 'I wished they warned me how much pain I was actually going to be in.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As time went on, everything doctors said would happen did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;ATL damages the brain's white matter, which connects brain regions that help with communication and body movements and plays a crucial role in cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;White matter is full of nerve fibers protected by a covering called myelin. Myelin protects the fibers and helps send messages and electrical signals in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mr Haendel said two nurses were gossiping in his room. When one said they shouldn't talk in front of the patient, the other responded saying he couldn't hear them because he was 'brain dead'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Damage to these interrupts the transmission of messages and communication between brain regions, leading to problems with movement and speaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;ATL has multiple causes, including environmental toxins, pesticides, chemotherapy and drug abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors told Mr Haendel his condition resulted from a toxin he inhaled. He and his doctors aren't sure exactly what toxin, but Mr Haendel had been using heroin and he said he was regularly exposed to chemicals and pesticides in his day job as a chef. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ajnr.org/content/40/2/267"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;analyzing approximately 100 patients with ATL found opioids were the second most common cause of the condition (19 percent) and led to the second worst outcome in patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel was repeatedly transferred from long-term care facility to the hospital to rehab clinics since his illness was deemed terminal and doctors didn't know how to help him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All the while, Mr Haendel heard people discussing him, thinking he wasn't conscious. Little by little, he noticed the medical staff caring for him eventually stopped acknowledging and talking to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/kelley_greene/locked-in-syndrome-survivor-jake-haendel"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/kelley_greene/locked-in-syndrome-survivor-jake-haendel"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;BuzzFeed he heard a member of his medical team complaining about caring for him and when there was a discussion about the high costs he was incurring, one family member said: 'Well, I have a feeling the problem will work itself out any day now.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One day, two nurses entered his room gossiping. When one said they shouldn't talk in front of the patient, Mr Haendel said the other responded: 'Don't worry, he can't hear you. He's brain dead, anyway.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel thought: 'Holy s***, they think I'm brain dead? [I have to] let them know. During this time, I realized there was something scarier than death. I thought I might be stuck like this forever.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mr Haendel's condition specifically was acute toxic progressive leukoencephalopathy (ATPL), with 'progressive' indicating his symptoms were quickly worsening. This caused 'locked in syndrome,' a coma in which a person is still conscious&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3tYCFQIelKqSuNMP26QYDy"&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;on the podcast Blink: 'I just started to panic and freak out. Am I brain dead? Could it be? Is that possible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Immediately I'm on a mission. I [have to] let them know I'm not brain dead.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors performed MRIs and EEGs &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14356349/first-recording-dying-human-brain-revealed-death.html"&gt;to determine brain function and activity&lt;/a&gt;, which showed a 'catastrophic' brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel said: 'There was no possible way any neurologist thought I was with it at all. Vegetative at best. Disconnected from all reality.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was experiencing 'locked in syndrome.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel said 'doctors didn't know what to do with me. I wasn't getting better but I wasn't dying either. It felt like I was stuck in limbo.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At one point, he was sent home to be cared for. It was then that Ellen began isolating her husband from family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the little family she still allowed to visit, Ellen established a rigid care plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Mr Haendel's father was 45 minutes late for one of his care shifts, he and Ellen began yelling at each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel heard someone shouting 'You're strangling me! You're strangling me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said on Blink: 'Then I hear a bottle pop... like a two-liter Coke bottle [bouncing] off someone's head. Then I hear a human being tumbling down the stairs, crashing into the door and I hear my dad's mumbles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I want to say I heard "why did you do this to me?" and then I heard the door open and someone crawling out the door and the door pulled shut.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then heard Ellen calling 911, saying 'My father-in-law just tried to kill me. Tried to strangle me,' though Mr Haendel said he is almost certain the voice of the person who asked 'why did you do this to me?' was his father's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel added: 'And that's all I know. l did not see my father ever again or hear anything about him again or anyone in my family ever again.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While he detailed the incident on the Blink podcast, he has yet to reveal more details on anything following that event. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he has detailed his recovery, which began when a doctor at Mass General Hospital in Boston noticed him make subtle movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel said the doctor asked: 'Hey, do you guys see that? I think he’s moving something.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the doctor was dismissed and told the movements were involuntary.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel said on TikTok: 'He told me that if I could hear him, I should try to move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I gathered every bit of strength I had and tensed my whole body — and it actually worked. It was the first real sign of hope.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors brought in a nonverbal speech therapist who taught him how to communicate via blinking, then use a letterboard, on which he spelled out 'I can hear you.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2019, after intensive physical, occupational and speech therapy, he began to be able to move his neck and make primitive noises. Then came the use of his fingers and arms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of 2020, Mr Haendel was able to move home and for the last four years has been continuing therapy and is now learning to walk with a cane.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'At the end of 2020, after years of hard work, I finally moved back home, though I still needed 24-hour care. Today, I’m still recovering, but I’ve come a long way.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rabies is caused by a virus present in the saliva of infected animals and is transmitted through contact with the virus. The disease affects the nervous systen and is deadly to humans once symptoms appear, according to Pinal County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pinal County officials say animals infected with the disease may have a change in behavior, either by acting more aggressively or more tamed than usual. Animals may also appear agitated and excited or paralyzed and frightened, however some don't show any signs of illness before death from rabies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is recommended that people and pets avoid wild animals and not to "rescue" seemingly abandoned young wild animals. If you have been bitten or scratched by a wild animal, wash the area with soap and water and go to the nearest emergency room for medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For additional information about rabies, visit the &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;CDC's website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq4xtn002e5gm2xpfahtgo@published"&gt;My first pimple was a defining moment in my life. I recall feeling confused as to why something dreaded by teenagers was happening to me, a 9-year-old. That first pimple soon became my first breakout. From there, my skin never cleared up, despite spending a decade in and out of dermatology offices.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5kxd000o3573snammxh9@published"&gt;During one of those doctor appointments, I was given antibiotics for my acne. According to my dermatologist, the constellation of zits that marred my face was likely an overgrowth of the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Cutibacterium acne&lt;/em&gt;. It’s well known that &lt;em&gt;C. acnes&lt;/em&gt; play a key role in acne, so antibiotics to fight the bacterium seemed like the logical solution. We started with topical creams, which helped at first. Once those stopped working, potent oral antibiotics followed. No matter the treatment, the outcome was always the same: temporary improvement, only for the pimples to return with a vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5l01000p35736v51j836@published"&gt;By my mid-20s, it was clear that the acne was more than a lingering symptom of puberty; it was a chronic condition. I was facing the harsh reality that modern skin care may never give me a clear complexion.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5l2m000q3573g2tfn2wq@published"&gt;That was also the time when I started my Ph.D. in food microbiology and was developing a deeper appreciation of bacterial systems. Naturally, I turned to examining my acne—and its refusal to leave my face—through the lens of a microbiologist. As it turns out, people blessed with healthy skin &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13578-023-01072-w"&gt;have comparable amounts of the bacteria &lt;em&gt;C. acnes&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;to those with acne. The devil’s in the details when we examine strain-level differences: acne-prone individuals tend to have a greater diversity of &lt;em&gt;C. acnes&lt;/em&gt; strains—and that diversity includes more pathogenic strains.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="66" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5l6p000r3573omjxbf2a@published"&gt;Much to my chagrin, I learned there is a link between &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13578-023-01072-w"&gt;antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that the &lt;em&gt;C. acnes&lt;/em&gt; strains that are antibiotic-resistant are the same strains causing aggressive breakouts. This explains why antibiotics failed me time and time again: They selected for the resistant and hypervirulent strains of &lt;em&gt;C. acnes&lt;/em&gt;. While they could briefly quell the bacterium on my face, the resistant strains just ended up taking over.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5l89000s35738e16s832@published"&gt;As a zit-faced grad student, I started a new research project that used lactic acid bacteria, or LAB, as a method for food safety. Basically, the idea was to explore how LAB could be used to colonize a food environment in order to prevent the outgrowth of spoilage or pathogenic bacteria. This is what’s known as a “protective culture”: we collaborate with good microbes in order to keep bad microbes—and foodborne illness—away. It’s the microbial approach to “the enemy of my enemy is my friend”; a strategic alliance that acknowledges not all bacteria are bad. Sometimes, we just want to create an environment with our &lt;em&gt;preferred&lt;/em&gt; microbial population.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lak000t357366fs772n@published"&gt;Spending long hours reading research on LAB amid a particularly disheartening breakout, I became fixated on the idea that the key to clearer skin lay in the strategic inclusion of beneficial bacteria through probiotics rather than the indiscriminate eradication of bacteria through broad-spectrum antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="23" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lct000u3573pfhn43p3@published"&gt;Assuming a bloom of virulent &lt;em&gt;C. acnes&lt;/em&gt; was to blame, I hypothesized that recolonizing my skin microbiota with probiotic LAB could effectively treat my acne.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lfa000v35733z4hh6nn@published"&gt;It’s worth mentioning that LAB is an umbrella term for a group of bacteria that share certain characteristics, with the most notable being their ability to produce lactic acid. While &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/not-all-lactic-acid-bacteria-are-probiotics-but-some-are/9701ED42C873B008AF3F26F50132D2BF"&gt;not all LAB are classified as probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, LAB are the most commonly used probiotics in food products. In fact, yogurt, one of the most well-known probiotic foods, is a product of the LAB &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7602395/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Streptococcus thermophilus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus bulgaricus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which convert lactose (the sugar in milk) into lactic acid.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lhq000w35733bnd7oth@published"&gt;Given yogurt’s well-established ties to &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10408398.2014.883356"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;, I wondered if its probiotic effect was transferable to my skin microbiome. Interestingly, in 1912, a scientist named Dr. J. Peyri documented &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9318165/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus bulgaricus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as the first topical probiotic studied for skin diseases in a paper titled “Topical Bacteriotherapy of the Skin.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="23" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lka000x3573c1y9t4mr@published"&gt;So, channeling Peyri, I embarked on a borderline socially unacceptable experiment where I smeared yogurt on my face in the name of science.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lmo000y3573bbf3yzz0@published"&gt;My approach was simple: I applied plain yogurt on my face twice a day for roughly a month. I stuck with plain yogurt, avoiding flavored products containing added sugars, due to the potential link &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666328722000281"&gt;between high-glycemic diets and acne&lt;/a&gt;. While I wasn’t particular about brands, my main criterion was that the label indicated “live cultures,” which means that each gram contained at least 10 million LAB cells.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="13" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lp1000z3573tr9gnl17@published"&gt;The results were outstanding. For the first time since childhood, I was acne-free.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lrd00103573qquurnbp@published"&gt;I felt like I won the Nobel Prize for pimple science. Excited to share my findings with my sister-in-law, a fellow woman in STEM, I anticipated an enthusiastic discussion about microbiome science. Not wanting to burst my bubble, she gently informed me that &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dr-Tiwari-7/publication/383976966_A_comprehensive_review_of_acne's_facial_impact_and_the_therapeutic_potential_of_Indian_herbal_medicine/links/66e2d88ff84dd1716ce7a02e/A-comprehensive-review-of-acnes-facial-impact-and-the-therapeutic-potential-of-Indian-herbal-medicine.pdf"&gt;yogurt face masks&lt;/a&gt; have been a natural remedy in India for generations. It turns out that what I saw as a microbiology breakthrough was just common sense in Ayurvedic practice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lu400113573i9xtej07@published"&gt;In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/yogurt-face-mask"&gt;countless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://greatist.com/live/yogurt-for-face"&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt; praise yogurt for its skin care benefits, citing everything from lactic acid’s gentle&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11055559/"&gt; exfoliation effects&lt;/a&gt; to its &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2311-5637/8/12/703"&gt;probiotic properties&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/12/3/422"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; support these claims, showing that probiotics like &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; can help with acne by producing antibacterial compounds that inhibit &lt;em&gt;C. acnes &lt;/em&gt;and by reducing inflammation. A &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jocd.14971"&gt;clinical study&lt;/a&gt; out of Srinakharinwirot University’s Medical School found that a probiotic lotion derived from&lt;em&gt; Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; decreased both the abundance of &lt;em&gt;C. acnes&lt;/em&gt; and inflammatory lesions in patients with mild to moderate acne, with effects lasting up to four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

Ironically, years of dermatology visits and pricey serums hadn’t managed what a $3 tub of yogurt did in weeks.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lys00133573io5dnoj4@published"&gt;Much like my first pimple was a defining moment in my childhood, my 20s were split into two eras: what I now call pre-yogurt face and post-yogurt face. Years later, I still apply yogurt to my face—though now, in maintenance mode, I do it just once or twice a week instead of twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="27" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5m1n00143573k862bg65@published"&gt;With my acne finally under control, my focus has shifted. Now in my 30s, I’m increasingly intrigued by the potential &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jocd.14734"&gt;anti-aging effects&lt;/a&gt; of probiotics on skin health.&lt;/p&gt;

It ignited my interest in two emerging fields that are defining the future of medical science: food as medicine and microbiome therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="24" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5m6o00163573lz1y64xa@published"&gt;Both fields are emerging outside the traditional biopharma mold. Their intersection—where science meets people and where medicine meets food—is where I’ve found my calling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States officially launched its "war on cancer" by signing &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/overview/history/national-cancer-act-1971" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/overview/history/national-cancer-act-1971" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the National Cancer Act of 1971&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Broadly, the intention was to spur research into the biology of cancer to better treat — and potentially cure — the disease. However, the nation has now been embroiled in this "war" for over 50 years, and we are nowhere closer to victory, argues &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thebrooklyninstitute.com/people/nafis-hasan/" target="_blank" data-url="https://thebrooklyninstitute.com/people/nafis-hasan/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nafis Hasan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cancer scientist and associate faculty member at the Brooklyn Institute for Social Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new book called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=74387&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FMetastasis-Rise-Cancer-Industrial-Complex-Horizons%2Fdp%2F1945335181%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dlivescience-us-6922625869473866119-20" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.amazon.com/Metastasis-Rise-Cancer-Industrial-Complex-Horizons/dp/1945335181" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=74387&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FMetastasis-Rise-Cancer-Industrial-Complex-Horizons%2Fdp%2F1945335181%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id="1471" data-merchant-network="Amazon" data-merchant-url="amazon.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Metastasis: The Rise of the Cancer-Industrial Complex and the Horizons of Care&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Common Notions, 2025), Hasan writes that cancer research has hyperfocused on finding treatments for individuals at the expense of driving down cancer rates overall. For example, in the passage below, he describes how a fixation on "somatic mutation theory" — which states that mutations in specific genes are the primary drivers of cancer — ignores the dangers of environmental carcinogens and the benefits of public health efforts in curbing cancer incidence and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/11041-10-deadliest-cancers-cure.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/11041-10-deadliest-cancers-cure.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 10 deadliest cancers, and why there's no cure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that cancer may be a hereditary disease can be traced back to the early twentieth century. Around 1900, the biologists Theodor Boveri and Walter Sutton rediscovered Gregor Mendel's laws of biological inheritance and proposed that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/27248-chromosomes.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/27248-chromosomes.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chromosomes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were responsible for inheriting biological traits. Boveri later proposed that a tumor cell arose when cell division went wrong and chromosomes were improperly distributed. In Boveri's view, "the problem of tumors is a cell problem." This was perhaps the first conceptualization of the "cancer cell," a lone culprit that could wreak havoc in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first experimental proof that cancer was potentially heritable came from Harvard scientist Ernest E. Tyzzer, who showed that the selective breeding of cancerous mice resulted in a disproportionately high rate of tumor incidence across generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of cancer as a genetic disease was also advanced by the eugenics movement, which performed cancer research to assure racial "purity" in the twenties and thirties. For example, the widely used Pap smear test for cervical cancer was first &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5972093/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5972093/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;presented at the Third Race Betterment Conference&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 1928. Nazi Germany's research on smoking and lung cancer claimed that differential cancer rates between Jews and "Aryans" was due to blood (not workplace chemical exposures). The U.S. private sector also held exclusionary views, with DuPont refusing to hire workers with a family history of cancer, given the high rates of bladder cancer among dye workers. The scientist Carl Weller, following his discovery of retinoblastoma (a tumor of the eyes) in children, advocated that parents of children with retinoblastoma be sterilized. As late as 1956, Wilhelm Hueper, the first Director of the Environmental Cancer Section of the NCI [National Cancer Institute], suggested that Black workers would be most suitable to workplaces where exposures to carcinogenic chemicals were unavoidable given their alleged resistance to the carcinogenic action of coal tar, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/38169-electromagnetism.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/38169-electromagnetism.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;UV radiation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and petroleum derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other scientists pushed back on these narratives of racial traits and cancer incidence. For instance, the notion that West Africans were racially predisposed to higher rates of liver cancer lost credibility when Japanese immigrants to the U.S. suffered the same type of cancer — the cause turned out to be &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/aflatoxins" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/aflatoxins" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;aflatoxins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; [toxins produced by fungi that can end up on various crops] in their diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-sQQWZCayvrPUkYyAdb4WjM" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-sQQWZCayvrPUkYyAdb4WjM slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/rosalind-franklin-knew-dna-was-a-helix-before-watson-and-crick-unpublished-material-reveals" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/rosalind-franklin-knew-dna-was-a-helix-before-watson-and-crick-unpublished-material-reveals"&gt;&lt;u&gt;discovery of DNA's double helix structure&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the fifties generated momentum for molecular biology, but the field did not concern itself with the cancer problem until the late seventies. Many molecular biologists were skeptical of government-sponsored research and worried they would lose their independence and be pushed to find cancer-causing viruses. Ironically, institutional support from the Special Virus Cancer Program (SVCP) later laid the foundations for the resurgence of a molecular theory of carcinogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This resurgence was driven by the SVCP director, Robert Huebner. Huebner was inspired by French studies showing that bacterial genes could remain in a repressed state and proposed the "oncogene theory" of carcinogenesis. In short, he believed there were cancer-causing genes that just needed to be identified. He previously confirmed that certain viruses gave rise to tumors in hamsters but wanted to dive deeper into how this happened. He suspected that viral genes were responsible for initiating tumors in the hamsters and, as the manager of SVCP's annual $10 million budget, he had the resources and authority to pour money into molecular cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early seventies, Huebner awarded millions of dollars to both private contractors and public institutions to study the molecular actions of viruses suspected of causing cancers in humans. However, by 1974, the White House's proposed budget for the NIH [National Institutes of Health] included three times as much funding for private contractors as for traditional research grants. The use of contract work was so extensive that by 1976, SVCP project officers worked in private contractor buildings (e.g., at Meloy Laboratories, Microbiological Associates, and Flow Laboratories). Huebner's largesse towards private contractors became a focal point of attack by molecular biologists suffering from financial precarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-left inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Nafis Hasan. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Courtesy of Nafis Hasan)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Watson (of Watson and Crick fame) established a virus cancer laboratory in 1968 and was appointed to the National Cancer Advisory Board in 1972, despite his objections to the War on Cancer. Molecular biologists like Watson posed an "anti-communist critique" of the War on Cancer by contending that government meddling in their disciplines stifled their freedom. Watson wanted to make molecular biology a major recipient of NIH and NCI funding, but without the government directing the research. He advocated for his friend, Norton Zinder, to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cshl.edu/archives/expanded-commentary/cancer-and-cronyism-at-the-nih-norton-zinder-and-the-special-virus-cancer-program/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cshl.edu/archives/expanded-commentary/cancer-and-cronyism-at-the-nih-norton-zinder-and-the-special-virus-cancer-program/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lead a committee to investigate the work&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the VCP in 1974. [The Special Virus Cancer Program (SVCP) was later called just the Virus Cancer Program (VCP).]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subsequent Zinder Report was the nail in the coffin for the VCP, which was already under pressure from Congress for its inability to produce results about cancer-causing viruses or vaccines to fight them. While Watson and other molecular biologists decried the use of contracts and the VCP's goals, they readily used VCP funds and infrastructure to continue their own research. In fact, VCP infrastructure supported oncogene theory all the way to its final iteration, the somatic mutation theory (SMT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMT postulates that cancer is caused by mutations that either permanently activate or repress genes. The first validation came in 1976 with the discovery of gene &lt;em&gt;src &lt;/em&gt;in normal human cells. Continued VCP support allowed researchers at the University of California, San Francisco to grow, develop, and hone the technique of molecular hybridization, which would be instrumental in detecting the&lt;em&gt; src&lt;/em&gt; gene in human cells. By the late seventies, molecular biologists and viral cancer researchers had cataloged several viral genes suspected of causing human cancers. However, absolute proof of human gene involvement in carcinogenesis was still missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not until 1982 that Robert Weinberg would find the missing link — using hybridization probes, he showed the presence of &lt;em&gt;v-ras&lt;/em&gt; in a human bladder cancer tissue specimen. In 1983, SMT was further boosted by the discovery of proteins involved in carcinogenesis. All these discoveries and advancements — hybridization probes, viral gene catalogs, and purified proteins from viruses — were products of the VCP's financial and material infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMT eventually surpassed viral carcinogenesis theory as the leading theory of carcinogenesis and gained social and institutional acceptance (e.g., the prestigious Lasker Awards &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://laskerfoundation.org/winners/1983-albert-lasker-basic-medical-research-award/" target="_blank" data-url="https://laskerfoundation.org/winners/1983-albert-lasker-basic-medical-research-award/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;went to oncogene researchers in 1982&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Vincent DeVita, the Director of the NCI under Reagan, recommitted the Institute's budget to genetic research and further cut the environmental carcinogen testing program. The discovery of oncogenes and related proteins also opened a new arena for cancer therapies and fueled pharmaceutical industry interest in collaborations with universities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most scientific retellings of this history suggest that the shift from environmental carcinogens to viruses and, ultimately, to individuals' genes happened in the vacuum of universal knowledge creation. Nevertheless, a confluence of neoliberalism, libertarian ideology, and government policy cemented the idea that genes are responsible for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somewhat problematically, experimental evidence indisputably determined that genetic fragments found in cancerous cells are also found in normal cells. However, the explanation for this fact was constructed by social and political forces. As early as 1975, the American Business Cancer Research Foundation, funded largely by the chemical industry, tried to shift the focus away from prevention and towards identifying the "underlying mechanism." The Reagan administration was more than happy to advance these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molecular biologists, who once decried the VCP's use of contracts, were more than happy to participate in private-public collaborations that directed money to their labs. Some had even publicly cautioned against environmental regulations when the NCI, under the previous Carter administration, moved to increase funding for environmental carcinogenesis research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMT renewed the biomedical settlement — a commitment to treating diseases instead of preventing them. It also facilitated the real subsumption of academic research under capitalism and, consequently, an explosive growth of the cancer drug market and capital accumulation by the biotech and pharma industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this line of attack in the War on Cancer has had few meaningful outcomes for cancer patients. After more than four decades since the discovery of the first oncogene, Robert Weinberg candidly reflected on his discovery of &lt;em&gt;ras&lt;/em&gt;: "The greatest decreases in cancer-associated mortality have come from reductions in disease incidence [prevention] rather than treatment, such as the therapies that some anticipated would flow directly from RAS research."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A holiday can help. These days, there are retreats to tackle everything from sleep issues to the perimenopause – but less specialist holidays are beneficial too. When cruise company &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/cruise-make-you-healthier/"&gt;Cunard commissioned a scientific study&lt;/a&gt; of 40 passengers on a cruise aboard the Queen Mary 2 from Southampton to New York in 2024, it found that stress levels reduced by 35 per cent between days one and five on average, with cognitive abilities rising by around 26 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, we outline eight midlife health problems and the holidays to help tackle them, from gentle breaks by the sea to sporting getaways and spa sojourns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you have a health condition, always consult your doctor before travelling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Best for… high blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swingers rejoice – golf holidays are good for your blood pressure. In 2018, the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness&lt;/em&gt; published the results of the East Tyrolean Health Tourism Study, which examined the cardiovascular effects on healthy participants of week-long holidays involving either golf or Nordic walking and e-biking. The golf group experienced significantly decreased blood pressure, with the study concluding “playing golf is a very effective antihypertensive treatment”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book a break, including time on the fairways, with &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.jet2.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Jet2&lt;/a&gt;. Its has specialist holidays such as a week at the Algarve’s Monte Rei Golf and Country Club, including five rounds of golf and flights from Stansted, from £1,850pp self-catering (0333 014 0236).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Best for… poor mental health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social prescribing is an emerging treatment for low mood, with the Academy for National Social Prescribing suggesting that “arts and culture and physical activities, and those that take place in nature, can alleviate issues relating to loneliness, stress, mild to moderate depression, and anxiety”. Some of the benefits can be garnered on a group holiday tied to personal interests, whether that means a painting retreat geared to midlife women or a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/activity-and-adventure/10-best-cycling-holidays-2024-brecon-cotswolds-norway-italy/"&gt;guided group cycling trip&lt;/a&gt; through the countryside with like-minded pedallers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.cyclingforsofties.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Cycling For Softies&lt;/a&gt;’ Bike and Boat itineraries are sociable trips with nights spent on barges or river cruisers. An easy, week-long Provence and the Camargue trip costs from £1,355pp half-board, with daily cycling (020 7471 7760).&lt;/p&gt;

But this is no longer the case,” said professor Nick Steel, from UEA’s Norwich Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-decreases-in-life-expectancy"&gt;Decreases in life expectancy &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1990 to 2011, lower death rates from &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/climate-change-worsens-cardiovascular-health-risks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular diseases&lt;/a&gt; and cancers steadily increased average life expectancy across the continent. But the study found that between 2011 and 2019, progress stagnated as major risk factors like obesity, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol either rose or stopped improving in virtually all European nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that deaths from cardiovascular diseases were the primary driver of the reduction in life expectancy improvements between 2011–19. Unsurprisingly, the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/life-expectancy-fell-sharply-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Covid pandemic&lt;/a&gt; was responsible for decreases in life expectancy seen between 2019–21,” explained Steel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers highlight that while improved treatments for high cholesterol and blood pressure have helped, they haven’t offset the harmful effects of increasingly unhealthy lifestyles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the pandemic further eroded longevity figures after 2019, the concern is that people may begin dying younger unless governments take robust action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-government-policies-targeting-health-risks"&gt;Government policies targeting health risks &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 19 European countries studied, England showed the sharpest reduction in life expectancy growth following 2011, a trend mirrored to varying degrees in the rest of the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, some nations, including Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Denmark, and Belgium, managed better resilience. They also had stronger policies targeting health risks and a more favorable record in controlling major cardiovascular threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In contrast, England and the other UK nations fared worst after 2011 and also during the Covid pandemic, and experienced some of the highest risks for heart disease and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-is-the-next-frontier-in-cancer-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, including poor diets,” Steel said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that stronger government policies are needed to reduce major health risks including obesity, poor diet, and low physical activity – to improve population health over the long term.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-human-life-expectancy-still-improve"&gt;Can human life expectancy still improve?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study emphasizes that rising longevity is still possible. “Life expectancy for older people in many countries is still improving, showing that we have not yet reached a natural longevity ceiling,” Steel explained. By focusing on preventing early deaths – chiefly among younger adults – there is ample room to reduce mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results are a cause for concern especially here in the UK, but also some hope,” said John Newton, a scientist at the European Center for Environment and Human Health at the &lt;a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Exeter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We should be concerned because many European countries including the UK are showing such poor progress but hopeful because addressing the underlying causes of major illnesses appears to be effective if only improvements in the key risks can be sustained.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-urgent-need-for-action"&gt;Urgent need for action&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah Price, National Director of Public Health at &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NHS England&lt;/a&gt;, said the findings highlight a need for stronger measures to tackle cardiovascular disease and cancer at their roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The slowdown in life expectancy improvements, particularly due to cardiovascular disease and cancer, highlights the urgent need for stronger action on the root causes – poor diet, physical inactivity, and obesity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the NHS offers weight management programs and widespread blood pressure checks to curb these conditions, Price emphasized that government intervention is crucial to address the broader societal drivers of obesity and unhealthy lifestyles. “We cannot treat our way out of the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/childhood-obesity-rates-are-surging-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; crisis, and we need to stem it at source,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reversing-the-human-life-expectancy-trend"&gt;Reversing the human life expectancy trend&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the study found that while the European public enjoyed steady life expectancy gains for decades, those gains have lately diminished – mostly due to unhealthy diets, lack of exercise, and the pandemic’s toll. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, reversing this trend depends on decisive actions, from healthier lifestyle promotion to better policy frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, a coordinated public health response that prioritizes dietary changes, physical activity, and tackling obesity may help restore the upward curve in life expectancy. Otherwise, Europe’s younger generations risk shorter lifespans than those who came before them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(25)00009-X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-ralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 14:38:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTFBzYzMwVTBiWk5QZmdPdHNhcnlMRGRVeWtXaTd4ZzFZNzdhVWFqbUVzVmRpblpBa1ExVWwzZFBObnMzandzN2NWTjFiQWFjM0FQOVRWdFRTcDRQN1hmUmZTR3o0aUJ0VjI5Y3J0UlRPaEVLbFZidnAyWlNZYw</guid></item><item><title>New FDA-Approved Diabetes Drug Slashes Heart Attack and Stroke Risk - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxPVE5nckY5WFY3d0dzd19aSWNSa0lpRU9uSGgyOXc3aHE3NFp1MzVOTGxCMTRGYTA5NmlNWDNpOGxsRWlYVWhyS29hOFRUcmhTSVJObmt4LWRXOEZDT1ZNNmlWWXB6MFFTa0NzbzlpTjRyc2o4UUJTU3BFNGtMc25seWdOZl9lQ055X2dxNVJvUE9ueGRPakR5ZQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 14:36:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPVE5nckY5WFY3d0dzd19aSWNSa0lpRU9uSGgyOXc3aHE3NFp1MzVOTGxCMTRGYTA5NmlNWDNpOGxsRWlYVWhyS29hOFRUcmhTSVJObmt4LWRXOEZDT1ZNNmlWWXB6MFFTa0NzbzlpTjRyc2o4UUJTU3BFNGtMc25seWdOZl9lQ055X2dxNVJvUE9ueGRPakR5ZQ</guid></item><item><title>What Is HKU5-CoV-2?

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have discovered a virus that can enter human cells in a similar way to the virus that causes COVID-19. But the germ — HKU5-CoV-2 — doesn’t enter cells as effectively, so experts caution the findings shouldn’t be “overblown.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China described the virus and potential treatments for infections in the journal &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00144-8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00144-8" aria-label="Cell"&gt;&lt;em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00144-8"&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is HKU5-CoV-2?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HKU5-CoV-2 is a virus found in bats. It’s a type of coronavirus, a large group of germs that can affect mammals and birds. Some have passed from animals to humans, like SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. Some coronaviruses cause mild symptoms in humans, while others can be lethal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists study viruses like HKU5-CoV-2 to find out how they work and how readily they might pass to humans. The Wuhan Institute researchers tested the newly-discovered germ in test tubes and models of the human gut and airways to investigate its transmission potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found the virus’s spike protein was able to bind with the membrane of human cells via a receptor enzyme that sits on their surface. This protein has a feature called a “furin cleavage site” that helps it latch on to the receptor enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Is HKU5-CoV-2 A Threat To Humans?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This potential transmission pathway is similar to that of the highly-contagious SARS-CoV-2. But although it was better adapted to human cells than certain other similar viruses, HKU5-CoV-2 did not infect human cells as readily as SARS-CoV-2. In fact, it was significantly worse at binding to human cells, among other limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, scientists have urged caution over the results. The researchers themselves wrote in their study that the “risk of emergence in human populations should not be exaggerated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University of Minnesota infectious disease expert Dr. Michael Osterholm told &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/chinese-researchers-find-bat-virus-enters-human-cells-via-same-pathway-covid-2025-02-21/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/chinese-researchers-find-bat-virus-enters-human-cells-via-same-pathway-covid-2025-02-21/" aria-label="Reuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; the reaction to the research was “overblown.” He said it was also possible that increased immunity to similar viruses could help protect the public from another &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katherinehignett/2024/11/07/uk-to-launch-world-first-genomics-led-pandemic-warning-system/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/katherinehignett/2024/11/07/uk-to-launch-world-first-genomics-led-pandemic-warning-system/" target="_self" aria-label="pandemic"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Despite these calls for caution, the news appears to have boosted shares in the manufacturers behind vaccines for &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katherinehignett/2024/03/31/covid-19-brings-down-healthy-life-expectancy-in-the-uk/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/katherinehignett/2024/03/31/covid-19-brings-down-healthy-life-expectancy-in-the-uk/" target="_self" aria-label="COVID-19"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. Shares of Pfizer, Moderna and Novovax rose on Friday following the news, according to &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://news.google.com/read/CBMisgFBVV95cUxQbWhIWDFBb2thbGE1ODVGLU9aM2VQZVJHbjF0NEVyR1UwODZPeExRQ0pwYXkxSUtDOWt0WWZTV1g5RjNJSDNYOF9meWlKdUNrcHVGVXpjcE9VZGVQUTZpX1M3Vk1RLUhITGM4NHNySDhHVTZ4OE9LVHZFTmZhdEs1Nk9DUjd0OTJXRzNfdlN2UGYxVThGdFVUNHlDSXBLN3F0cXpJMVZVU1AwQ1ZJOG5IVnl3?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://news.google.com/read/CBMisgFBVV95cUxQbWhIWDFBb2thbGE1ODVGLU9aM2VQZVJHbjF0NEVyR1UwODZPeExRQ0pwYXkxSUtDOWt0WWZTV1g5RjNJSDNYOF9meWlKdUNrcHVGVXpjcE9VZGVQUTZpX1M3Vk1RLUhITGM4NHNySDhHVTZ4OE9LVHZFTmZhdEs1Nk9DUjd0OTJXRzNfdlN2UGYxVThGdFVUNHlDSXBLN3F0cXpJMVZVU1AwQ1ZJOG5IVnl3?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" aria-label="Bloomberg"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Might HKU5-CoV-2 Be Treated?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should a bat virus like HKU5-CoV-2 infect a human, the researchers said monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs might help treat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antiviral drugs are designed to stop the spread of virus around the body, potentially easing symptoms and shortening illness. They’re used to treat a range of illnesses, including flu and COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monoclonal antibodies are proteins made in labs to target a wide range of illnesses, including cancer. They have been tailored to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, for example, to try and prevent it from infecting human cells — a treatment that’s especially important for people with weak immune systems who may not gain strong protection from vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can be highly effective treatments, but their efficacy for COVID-19 varies depending on the variant a patient contracts. So scientists had to develop new monoclonal antibody treatments quickly to try and keep up with the mutating virus.&lt;/p&gt;

In 2023, an &lt;a href="https://americanpetproducts.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;American Pet Products Association&lt;/a&gt;'s pet ownership survey suggested about 13% of households have backyard chickens. That's especially popular among millennials and Gen Z.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.baltimoremagazine.com/section/homegarden/baltimoreans-embrace-backyard-chicken-raising-trend/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Baltimore Magazine&lt;/a&gt; put the number at close to 12 million people in the U.S. with backyard chickens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and agriculture officials say there are steps you can take to improve the odds your flock stays healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highly pathogenic avian influenza has been confirmed throughout the U.S. in recent years, including in some backyard flocks. As the name suggests, the H5N1 bird flu circulating is very contagious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How bird flu spreads&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many wild birds are infected with bird flu. And that's the most common way that other animals become infected. They encounter, play with or eat infected wild birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/media/pdfs/2024/07/avian-flu-transmission.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions reports&lt;/a&gt; that the incidence of backyard flocks infecting their human owners is pretty rare, but it does happen, usually through direct contact. People handle their birds, then touch their own eyes, nose or mouth, which are the entry points for infection. They can also inhale droplets without touching the birds. The health agency notes that infected birds that can be contagious may look healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can also become infected from touching contaminated surfaces. By flapping their wings, scratching or shaking their heads, the birds can send droplets that can be inhaled or land on something that can be touched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC emphasizes that "no human bird infections have been reported from proper handling of poultry meat or from eating properly cooked poultry or poultry products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flocks that are infected may die suddenly. Or the poultry can have low energy, lack of appetite, purple discoloration, less egg production, ill-formed eggs, nasal discharge or coughing, lack of coordination and diarrhea, per the &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-companion-animals" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;American Veterinary Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Protecting yourself if you have chickens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC's &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/caring/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;guide for backyard flock owners&lt;/a&gt; offers a number of suggestions to minimize risk:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't touch sick or dead birds, their droppings, litter or water sources that might be contaminated with their bodily fluids without donning personal protective equipment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always wear protective equipment around sick or dead birds, including safety goggles, an N95 mask, disposable gloves, disposable and fluid-resistant coveralls and rubber boots. It should be put on and taken off in different clear areas, where possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't touch your eyes, nose or mouth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't touch your protective gear until you are removing it, then wash your hands in soap and water,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never wear used personal protective equipment in your home.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When cleaning and disinfecting, don't stir up the bird waste, dust or feathers, which can disperse the virus into the air. When you're done, toss the protective equipment or clean it properly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should remove the personal protective equipment in this order: First, clean and disinfect the boots, then take them off. Take off and throw away the coveralls, then do the same with the gloves. Wash your hands with soap and water. Next, take off the goggles, head cover and mask. If the goggles are reusable, disinfect them. Dispose of the mask. Wash hands with soap and water again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To disinfect the items that are reusable, use disinfectant approved by the Environmental Protection Agency that has label claims it is effective against influenza A viruses. Follow the label instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wash your clothing in hot water and detergent and dry on high heat. Immediately take a shower. And pay attention to your health for 10 days after you were exposed to potentially infected birds or contaminated materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cats and dogs at risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cats and dogs that are outdoors can also be at some risk if they encounter sick or dead birds. And that includes if they are near your backyard flock. The best prevention is to keep them away from wild birds, poultry and cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, signs for them can include fever, lethargy, low appetite, red and inflamed eyes, nasal or eye discharge, difficulty breathing and neurologic signs like tremors or poor coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association also says not to feed pets raw meat or poultry or raw milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 14:18:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxObnh2M2VQRXptd3NTQlAwSjVJVHhFaXZPeXJBam1vS2VFUHY0d0QtRVNGYmdVMTE5S2NLQUdUTkZOZFR4bS1xLTd6N2dkdzlwZF9jcGdYUGtrZ18zcmlFdXpYOXdBVGpxWWxQQzlvcmZ2VkxZMjI5WnFEb0E4dVl6dE9iSHIwcm5YNVdrcjRyWFZsbkZHQi1hTXhOaG1iQ09FLThN</guid></item><item><title>Who is in charge of health care?

				&lt;/aside&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Dannielle Wright hoped to get her life back on track by seeking treatment for her depression. Then, her doctor and insurance company could not agree on the best medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her case highlights a fundamental question about health care in the United States: Who is in charge — doctors or insurance companies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her insurance provider, &lt;a href="https://www.molinahealthcare.com/"&gt;Molina Healthcare&lt;/a&gt;, has four times denied coverage of an antidepressant medication prescribed by her doctor, Wright said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright, 32, said she has struggled with mental illness her entire life. She decided in December she wanted to restart antidepressants after experiencing negative side effects from medication three years prior. Her doctor’s office gave her a genetic test that indicated potential adverse reactions from all medications except the one her insurer won’t cover, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;

						
				&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;“Lesser cost alternatives may be available, including mere observation, or, where appropriate, no medical treatment at all,” a Feb. 7 letter from Molina Healthcare states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molina Healthcare maintains that genetic tests do not confirm whether a patient will be nonresponders to a particular drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never had insurance shut me down so blatantly,” Wright said. “I’m not the only one, but I can’t stop feeling like it’s intentional. There have been so many hard days where I know if Molina had just given me that antidepressant, it would have started working by now, and I could start getting my life back in order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molina Healthcare did not respond to multiple requests for comment before The Columbian’s deadline. However, in a separate Feb. 4 letter to Wright, the health care company states Wright must first try and fail treatment with two preferred drugs — duloxetine (Cymbalta) and venlafaxine (Effexor) — before it would cover desvenlafaxine succinate (Pristiq), the antidepressant her genetic test indicated would be the safest option.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;
		&lt;section class="article-content has-sidebar-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="d-flex d-lg-block flex-column mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;aside class="float-lg-left mr-lg-5 order-last"&gt;
					&lt;div class="article-inline photo my-6"&gt;&lt;figure class="mx-auto mb-0"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.columbian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1018250484-molina-health-care_2.12_TB02-768x579.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid" data-enlarge="https://www.columbian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1018250484-molina-health-care_2.12_TB02.jpg" data-photo-page="https://www.columbian.com/media/item/1018250484-molina-health-care_2-12_tb02/" data-disable-purchase="false" alt="Taylor Balkom/The Columbian (Taylor Balkom/The Columbian)"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption border-bottom border-light pb-3 buy-photo"&gt;

				&lt;/aside&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;“As you may be aware, the American Psychiatric Association does not recognize these genetic tests for initial medication selection,” Molina Healthcare wrote Feb. 4. “These genetic tests demonstrate how a patient metabolizes a drug, but does not confirm they will be ‘non-responders’ to certain medications. Your doctor must show you failed a trial of two preferred drugs. Or your doctor must show why the preferred drugs are not right for you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright said she has appealed the decision with Molina multiple times since the company’s original denial came in January, but it continues to impose step-therapy: a health care policy that requires patients to try less expensive medications before covering a medication that costs more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon Pharmacy lists Pristiq at about $370 for a 30-day supply without insurance, but prices elsewhere are listed around $570 a month. Duloxetine, available as a generic, costs about $10 a month, and venlafaxine ranges up to $135, depending on the dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By design, step-therapy and similar strategies can create administrative burdens aimed at steering patients and physicians to an insurer’s preferred treatment, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9067323/"&gt;according to a study from the National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;

						
				&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Wright plans to file a complaint with the Washington Office of the Insurance Commissioner, a small agency of about 280 employees who oversee the insurance market statewide. The agency has the authority to investigate complaints about a patient’s insurance company or agent and propose laws when consumer protections are needed, &lt;a href="https://www.insurance.wa.gov/what-we-do"&gt;according to its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephanie Marquis, public affairs director for the insurance commissioner’s office, said there are no regulations that require insurers to consider genetic testing when determining prescription coverage. However, a new bill this legislative session could change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bill%20Reports/House/1425%20HBA%20HCW%2025.pdf?q=20250215150313"&gt;House Bill 1425&lt;/a&gt;, sponsored by Rep. Lauren Davis, D-Shoreline, would require coverage of pharmacogenetic testing for psychotropic medication, which includes antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If passed, health plans — including health plans offered to public employees and through Medicaid — issued or renewed on or after Jan. 1, 2026, must provide coverage for pharmacogenetic testing. Health plans, the Health Care Authority and Medicaid managed care organizations would not be able to impose prior authorization or step-therapy requirements to this form of testing, according to the proposed bill.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;
		&lt;section class="article-content has-sidebar-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="d-flex d-lg-block flex-column mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;aside class="float-lg-right ml-lg-5 order-last"&gt;

				&lt;/aside&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Wright is insured through Washington’s Medicaid program, Apple Health, but she began coverage with Molina Healthcare in 2024 as a supplemental insurance because it covered a wider range of health care providers in Clark County, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until now, Wright was happy with her decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every single day in February has been spent fighting with Molina. The genetic test gave the result that Cymbalta and Effexor would not work for me,” Wright said. “At worst, it will hurt or kill me. At best, it just doesn’t do anything. I have been on medications in my past that have nearly killed me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tug-of-war&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental health has been a struggle for Wright since she was 5 years old, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to a yearslong battle with depression and anxiety, Wright has polycystic ovary syndrome, known as PCOS, a chronic condition that causes irregular periods, excess hair growth, weight gain and other symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;

						
				&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Wright’s previous provider at Rosewood Family Health Center — a medical clinic in Portland — conducted a genetic test through the company GeneSight after trying a combination of psychiatric medications without success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GeneSight analyzes how a person’s genes may affect their response to medications commonly prescribed for depression, anxiety, ADHD and other mental health conditions, &lt;a href="https://genesight.com/product/?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=performance-max&amp;amp;utm_content=&amp;amp;utm_term=&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA2cu9BhBhEiwAft6IxJzAoGuASjhGrdn0nuaURGdRXbDNBoGQQfI1NLzMZ8YPANjcF9J5IRoCopYQAvD_BwE"&gt;according to its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, Wright decided she wanted to try an antidepressant medication when she noticed a rapid decline in her mental health. Wright forwarded the genetic test to her new provider, Dr. Andriana Siefe at Legacy Health, and together, they decided she would benefit from an SSRI or SNRI antidepressant, in addition to regular therapy appointments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are a class of medications commonly used to treat depression and other mental health conditions. While SNRIs, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, work by increasing the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, according to the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;
		&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 29, Siefe wrote a letter advocating on behalf of Wright after coverage for the medication was first denied by Molina Healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With psychiatric medications, often we have historically done a trial and error approach where patients have had to try multiple medications before figuring out the ones that work best for them,” Siefe wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siefe said it is well known in medicine that if a patient’s family member does well on a medication, that patient is much more likely to do well on it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This just shows the genetic component of these choices of medication, and why it is such a gift that with modern testing we can know which medication is likely to do best with her genetics,” Siefe wrote. “This area of study is called pharmacogenetics and is likely to be the future of medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;
		&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;But Molina Healthcare does not view genetic testing as a valid measure for initial medication selection, according to its letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither does the American Psychiatric Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic testing is being marketed and used for a variety of reasons, including confirming or ruling out a suspected genetic condition, &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/genetic-testing-to-improve-psychiatric-medication"&gt;according to the APA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is also being marketed to improve the selection of medication for mental illness, such as depression,” the APA said on its website. “However, several recent expert reviews caution that while it holds much potential, the evidence does not yet show genetic testing is effective in improving psychiatric medication choices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Siefe disagrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siefe wrote that she finds it very troubling that Wright’s insurance company requires the two medications (duloxetine and venlafaxine) to be tried prior to trying the recommended medication based on her genetics.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;
		&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;“If we have objective data reporting that it is contraindicated to trial two medications, it goes against my oath as a physician to subject my patient to trying serious side effects that may not work well,” Siefe wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who has the final say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the insurance commissioner’s office, when a patient’s health insurance rejects a treatment or a bill dispute, that doesn’t have to be the final word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients have the option to file an appeal to their insurance provider, but if the answer is still no, they can file another appeal with an independent review organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A health insurance company cannot change, reduce or stop benefits for an ongoing course of treatment without providing you advance notice and an opportunity for review, &lt;a href="https://www.insurance.wa.gov/appealing-health-insurance-denial"&gt;according to the insurance commissioner’s office&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;
		&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;But Wright believes Molina Healthcare should not have been able to dismiss genetic testing within its denial in the first place — as does Siefe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I sincerely hope that insurances will start to consistently acknowledge the validity of these tests and then respect the patient/doctor combined decisions on best medications especially in psychiatric medicine,” Siefe wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Insurance roadblocks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claim denials by insurance companies were highlighted by &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/brian-thompson-unitedhealthcare-death-investigation-12-9-24/index.html"&gt;national media outlets&lt;/a&gt; following the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO Brian Thompson, which sparked further discussion about patient autonomy and the quality of the United States health care system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to an analysis of federal health care data by &lt;a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/health-insurance-claim-denials-and-appeals"&gt;ValuePenguin&lt;/a&gt;, UnitedHealthcare and Molina Healthcare were among the top 10 companies with the highest claim denial rates.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;
		&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;UnitedHealthcare had a 33 percent denial rate, while Molina Healthcare followed closely behind with a 26 percent denial rate, according to the December report by ValuePenguin that analyzed data from the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaiser Permanente and Providence Health Plan were among insurers with the lowest denial rates. Kaiser has a 6 percent denial rate, while Providence had a 4 percent denial rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ProPublica, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power, published a series of articles in 2022 called “&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/series/uncovered"&gt;Uncovered&lt;/a&gt;” that shed light on insurers’ rejections of millions of claims every year in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/evicore-health-insurance-denials-cigna-unitedhealthcare-aetna-prior-authorizations"&gt;One article in the series&lt;/a&gt; uncovered that many of the country’s largest insurers delegate medical reviews to EviCore, a company that determines whether to approve care for more than 100 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;
		&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;While data on insurers’ claim denials remains limited, ProPublica found available government figures indicate that insurers reject between 10 percent and 20 percent of submitted claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And what information it has released, experts say, is so crude, inconsistent and confusing that it’s essentially meaningless,” ProPublica said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‘Keep fighting’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright said throughout the denial process with Molina Healthcare, she’s been leaning on her partner, Jacob Christensen, writing down her feelings and finding comfort within online gaming communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I tend to hyperfocus on my comforts,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Wright files a complaint with the insurance commissioner’s office, she wants to go one step further and request an external review of her case.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;
		&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;External reviews are performed by independent review organizations that aren’t affiliated with an insurance company. The review can either uphold or overturn the insurance company’s position, according to the insurance commissioner’s office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once an independent review organization considers an appeal, that decision is final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Wright wants to advocate for change within the health insurance industry. She wants others who find themselves in a similar situation with an insurance company to know that they should keep fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want to change things. I am going to change things. It is angering because it feels like Molina is intentionally dehumanizing and depersonalizing me,” Wright said. “It feels like they just want me to continue to be depressed until I just give in and die.”

Excessive sugar consumption is linked to numerous health risks, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and metabolic disorders. Added sugars in processed foods contribute to insulin resistance, leading to type 2 diabetes. High sugar intake also promotes inflammation, elevates blood pressure, and increases the risk of fatty liver disease. Additionally, sugar is detrimental to dental health, causing cavities and decay. It contributes to energy crashes and cravings, leading to poor dietary habits. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 14:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Medical Mysteries: Her maddening cough had an unexpected cause - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxNRjRlVmxLVHBSZ2VaQTNIMUNIRVBiQ2pDLWg5Zzh3Sm1PWUJabTFnVm1leGZxRTY5c2NOWXRKTGYzNXdSSHNxVGZIeTUwd0xaM1lIT3Jza1FyRnFGZFBmUzJ0NWdxem1vWVdZaFdnY3VOY1JNaFFybW9CN3d5RGdQR2tFT05qV1pBdnN1TlFRWlI4M1JHMzQxYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z646LSICQZD35LSMZX4QBI67WI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Constance Meyer’s hacking cough was driving other people crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="I3YT7NFHBZBFNFMHD5OF2CSM7Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For more than a year, it had been the soundtrack of her life, disrupting the violin lessons she was giving, waking her up at night and irritating family and friends who were baffled by its imperviousness to multiple treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FZSCLEREHNAJVMEEEUXXMCZQV4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“That cough’s going to give me a heart attack!” quipped one father, a doctor who had accompanied his young son to a lesson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XA52AD3BOVFKRP7DPSG3TZZ57Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Meyer’s own doctors couldn’t agree on a cause.

Her maternal grandmother was only 35 when she died of breast cancer. Meyer said her fear was diminished, but not eradicated, when she tested negative for the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/brca-fact-sheet" target="_blank"&gt;BRCA genetic mutations &lt;/a&gt;that cause hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J5D6ETB2L5BQNBFWS4MLFN4BWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Her health, fitness and diet were priorities. A vegetarian who doesn’t touch junk food and walks at least three miles a day, Meyer was proud of her low cholesterol and blood pressure readings. “I’ll walk up seven flights of stairs instead of taking an elevator,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OIYIG6IRVBHTRIPXAPYCIYS55I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So in the spring of 2023 when she developed a dry cough sometimes accompanied by wheezing, without a precursor cold or other respiratory infection, she assumed it would go away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body grid-body grid-center" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4EWIJODJIZF4NAUYOGKRPVHQ5I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Instead, it got worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4M6CX74TEFCMBMG6CKCUN4MICQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After about three months Meyer consulted her longtime internist who ordered a chest X-ray which was normal.

She felt fine otherwise and had not missed a day of teaching.

Meyer said she coughed through the appointment and told the new doctor she was occasionally short of breath. The doctor ordered a standard &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856#:~:text=Transthoracic%20echocardiogram%2C%20also%20called%20a,or%20tear%20in%20the%20esophagus." target="_blank"&gt;echocardiogram, &lt;/a&gt;an ultrasound test that traces blood flow through the heart and its valves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MSHUTNDWO5ARHNCPDA32JPDE7U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The echo, the geriatrician told Meyer, looked “fantastic” and uncovered no abnormalities.

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Chickpeas&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an article titled The Nutritional Value and Health Benefits of Chickpeas and Hummus by a group of US health experts, they explained how this delicious food, which can also be enjoyed as hummus, is a great source of two essential nutrients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; They wrote: "Four tablespoons of traditional, chickpea-based hummus per day provides approximately two cups of legumes per week and 25 grams of dietary fibre - a shortfall nutrient in the diets of many adults and children. This same amount also provides approximately 14g of plant protein per week, as well as many other essential vitamins and minerals."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, protein and fibre are not only thought to help prevent conditions such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes, but they also work together to slow digestion and increase feelings of fullness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="9967166" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lemons&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lemons, which are a significant component of the cherished Ikarian dish, are also highlighted for their health benefits. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With three squeezed lemons included, one can receive about 60 percent of the recommended daily intake of vitamin C from just one lemon, which is believed to lower the risk of heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Healthline additionally notes that some studies suggest an increased consumption of citrus fruits may decrease the risk of lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Herbs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Herbs, particularly garlic and bay leaves used in Ikarian Chickpea soup, are credited with providing numerous health advantages to the locals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts often remark on garlic's potential to help lower cholesterol and combat seasonal ailments like the flu. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bahee Van de Bor, a paediatric dietician and spokesperson for the British Dietitian Association, praised its numerous advantages, telling the &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bbc"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;: "Garlic contains high levels of potassium, phosphorus, zinc, sulfur and moderate amounts of magnesium, manganese and iron. It's a bit of a wonder vegetable."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She further highlighted its nutritional richness and importance as a prebiotic fibre source, adding: "Not only does it offer a rich array of essential nutrients but also serves as an excellent source of prebiotic fibre, which is crucial for providing nourishment for the beneficial bacteria residing in our gut."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bristol Live</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 13:47:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQZ3N6V1pHZFh5aE1saUJqaEU4WG5MVnVNVmttTFM5NThFTTFXallhMkdPQzQ5b2dmSlRsQzc1YTNsT04tSktEYng4QWJTcmJueVhHNWVndThzMzdpSkhENWRyZXhlYWwtZ0UxSjJwQ0FUTFlhYTV2V0wwTVhwR0RzWG9nenNjNmdRRWZj0gGQAUFVX3lxTE5kRkdibTVsOFJZSnJFOUN1OXhZMkRkNFY0V1lNZjVNc042VElsOXBLSmV3NTk5a3c3VWIyLWRLQU04YVBNZzd3SkEzUWlOX0tpeE55WThJVXRoTjh3cXFzcm00UkFMSURvTHotTlB2R0JJQWJ3STlKZlFrN3BrNkhzU2lUMXZZUUVYMVNkd1RDdw</guid></item><item><title>The Best Bean to Help You Poop, According to Dietitians - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE5hcXZSOGU3azl4VVEyUFFKQ3hEajhvaDVmaElGbGZjVm1mWkFmLThpMW5BVTRQMWtkeUZnSEtYdzRUOWF3dXNTWlU4WnhMYWFzVWlQb0VBa1FjWjlPYnZqUnpTMDVBZm44N2FTT3hWdnZMdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewed by Dietitian Kelli McGrane, M.S., RD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pooping is an essential part of digestive health. Yet, it’s estimated that up to 16% of American adults have symptoms of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7833208/reasons-you-cant-poop/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:constipation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt;, which is partially defined as having less than three bowel movements per week. And trouble going comfortably only becomes more prevalent with age. Dealing with constipation can be painful and frustrating. The good news? You can help reduce symptoms of constipation by making a few tweaks to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to make going #2 a more pleasant experience? We spoke with two registered dietitians who explained why navy beans are the best bean to help you poop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Navy Beans Are the Best Beans to Help You Poop  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Loaded with Fiber&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the white bean family, navy beans are small, oval-shaped beans that pack an impressive amount of fiber. One cup of cooked navy beans provides a whopping 19 grams of fiber, or 55 to 86% of your daily recommended fiber intake, depending on your age and gender. Recall having a smooth toilet trip after eating baked beans? This could be why!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to keeping things moving along smoothly in your digestive tract, navy beans' high fiber content slows down digestion, which helps you feel full for longer and minimizes spikes in blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/289532/7-day-high-fiber-meal-plan-2000-calories/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:7-Day High Fiber Meal Plan: 2,000 Calories;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;7-Day High Fiber Meal Plan: 2,000 Calories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Contains Soluble and Insoluble Fiber&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navy beans are an excellent choice for staying regular because they contain &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:both soluble and insoluble fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;both soluble and insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;. “Soluble fiber helps with bowel movement by absorbing water, swelling to a gel-like form that softens the stools. Insoluble fiber helps add bulk to the stool and aids in the removal,” explains &lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDE, CDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDE, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, cardiology dietitian and owner of Entirely Nourished. She adds, “Having both of these fibers [also] helps support healthy cholesterol and blood pressure levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Supports Gut Health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navy beans’ high fiber content also contributes to a healthier gut microbiome. “Specifically, navy beans have a high content of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/289676/what-is-resistant-starch/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:resistant starch;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;resistant starch&lt;/a&gt;, a type of carbohydrate that isn’t digested in the small intestine,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherine-gervacio-900a1484/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Catherine Gervacio, BS, RD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Catherine Gervacio, BS, RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, “resistant starch becomes a source of food for bacteria (a prebiotic) in the large intestine, and in turn, the beneficial bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids that may have anti-inflammatory effects throughout the body,” Gervacio adds. Specifically, these short-chain fatty acids may help maintain a healthy gut lining and prevent harmful substances from entering the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Contains Magnesium, a Natural Laxative&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8012002/can-magnesium-help-you-poop/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Magnesium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Magnesium&lt;/a&gt; is a common ingredient in over-the-counter laxatives. Navy beans are an excellent source of this essential mineral, providing 23% of the daily recommended intake per cup.  Magnesium has been shown to help relieve occasional constipation by drawing water into the colon to keep things moving. It also helps relax intestinal muscles, making it easier for waste to pass through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ways to Enjoy Navy Beans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navy beans, dried and canned varieties, are affordable and versatile and can be added to a wide variety of dishes, like stews and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/creamy-white-chili-with-sweet-potatoes-white-beans-8718974" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chilis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;chilis&lt;/a&gt;. For Gervacio, nothing beats adding beans to a creamy, hearty bowl of soup, like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7939867/creamy-white-bean-soup/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Creamy White Bean Soup;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Creamy White Bean Soup&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/248881/chicken-white-bean-soup/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Chicken &amp;amp; White Bean Soup;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Chicken &amp;amp; White Bean Soup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also think outside the soup pot. Here are a few easy ways to use up a can of navy beans:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Tips to Keep You Regular&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pooping regularly requires more than just eating navy beans. Here are additional strategies to help keep things moving:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a variety of high-fiber foods&lt;/strong&gt;. Navy beans are just one of many fiber-containing foods. To get more nutrients in your diet it’s important to eat a variety of fiber-rich foods, including whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. Other bean varieties, including black beans, kidney beans, chickpeas, lentils and split peas are also brimming with fiber and health benefits. Just be aware that as great as fiber is, the amount also matters—eating &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8043390/too-much-fiber/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:too much fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;too much fiber&lt;/a&gt; can lead to gas and bloating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink plenty of fluids&lt;/strong&gt;. Staying hydrated helps make stools soft and easier to pass. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7825445/how-much-water-should-you-drink-by-the-numbers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:How much water you need;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;How much water you need&lt;/a&gt; depends on your activity level, body size, gender, health status, and environment. Generally speaking, women need 91 ounces and men need 125 ounces of fluids daily. Have trouble remembering to drink water? Using a water tracking app on your phone or keeping a water bottle with you throughout the day can make it easier to meet your goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay active. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-habit-to-start-to-poop-better-8772811" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Staying physically active;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Staying physically active&lt;/a&gt; can help relieve constipation by strengthening intestinal muscles and helping move food faster through the gut. Aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. Riding a bike, swimming, jogging, playing tennis, mowing the lawn, gardening and going for a brisk walk all count towards your weekly activity goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain medications, supplements and health conditions can cause or worsen constipation. If you’re concerned about your bowel habits, it’s important to talk with your healthcare provider. They can review your medical history and make changes to your care plan as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no one food alone can resolve your toilet troubles, navy beans are an excellent source of nutrients, like fiber and magnesium, that may provide some relief. Eating a variety of high-fiber foods, drinking plenty of water and staying active can also help keep you regular. If you’re working on upping your fiber game, just make sure to increase fiber in your diet slowly to minimize symptoms like gas or bloating.

Soluble fiber is the key. It dissolves in water and then forms like a gel in the stomach, slowing digestion. Insoluble fiber helps move food through your digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="F7UB2WDMDRA2LKD27PIK4ZDKXM"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;BERBERINE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="P4UQWKQV3NEZTNSE3D3YEKQA7A"&gt;Do a quick Google search for berberine and you will come across a handful of interesting headlines referring to it as “nature’s Ozempic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5U6BLC5SSZDELJXVERFE6Z235M"&gt;And considering the rising popularity of Ozempic and other weight loss drugs, that is bound to catch folks’ attention.

                        &lt;p&gt;If a pregnant woman takes &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/acetaminophen.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;acetaminophen&lt;/a&gt;, an ingredient found in pain relievers like Tylenol, Excedrin, and Panadol, her &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/child-adhd-risk-linked-to-mothers-use-of-acetaminophen#:~:text=Despite%20acetaminophen's%20classification%20as%20low,spectrum%20disorder%2C%20the%20researchers%20noted." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;unborn child could develop attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; (ADHD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a study published Feb. 6 in Nature Mental Health reported by &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/child-adhd-risk-linked-to-mothers-use-of-acetaminophen" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;UW News&lt;/a&gt;, the findings suggest that doctors should reconsider prescribing medications with acetaminophen to mothers during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior research shows that upward of 70% of pregnant women use acetaminophen during pregnancy to control pain or reduce fever. The drug, which is the active ingredient of many pain-relief medications, is one of the few considered safe to take during pregnancy by the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National News:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://mynorthwest.com/national/alabama-house-expedites-medicaid-for-pregnant-women-joining-other-states-with-high-mortality-rates/4046181"&gt;Alabama House expedites Medicaid for pregnant women, joining other states with high mortality rates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Acetaminophen is a common ingredient for pain relief&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acetaminophen is a common ingredient in over 600 different medications, both prescription and over-the-counter (OTC). Vicodin, Percocet, and Tylenol with Codeine are also over-the-counter medicines containing the pain reliever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most of the prior studies asked women to self-report whether they had taken Tylenol or anything that contained acetaminophen,” Brennan Baker, a researcher at Seattle Children’s Research Institute, told UW News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acetaminophen is often &lt;a href="https://www.bemedwise.org/health-research-and-reports/health-resources-and-toolkits/acetaminophen/acetaminophen-containing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;used to treat&lt;/a&gt; mild to moderate pain, such as headaches, muscle aches, arthritis, and toothaches, and to reduce fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This medication was also approved decades ago, and may need reevaluation by the FDA,” Dr. Sheela Sathyanarayana, a UW Medicine pediatrician, told UW News. “Acetaminophen was never evaluated for fetal exposures in relations to long-term neurodevelopmental impacts.”&lt;/p&gt;
                            
                        
&lt;p&gt;The children born to 300 mothers who agreed to give blood samples during pregnancy were followed for 8 to 10 years. Among the women who did not use acetaminophen during pregnancy, the rate of ADHD was 9%, but for the women who used acetaminophen, the ADHD rate was 18%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;New study suggests higher risk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite acetaminophen’s classification as low risk by regulatory agencies such as the FDA, new evidence suggests a potential link between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and adverse outcomes, like ADHD and ADHD autism spectrum disorder, the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The association was stronger among daughters than sons, with the daughters of acetaminophen-exposed mothers showing a 6.16 times higher likelihood of ADHD while the association was weaker and nonsignificant in males. Researchers did not know why the association was stronger in females.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker said mothers are often told to use acetaminophen, the primary agent in Tylenol, instead of ibuprofen, which is more likely to affect the fetal kidney or heart adversely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“(Acetaminophen) is really the only option to control fever or pain during pregnancy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There needs to be more research to figure out if some women can tolerate acetaminophen during pregnancy with no ill effects on the fetus while others cannot, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is obviously more work that needs to be done in this area,” Baker explained. “And we need to continually update our guidance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;

There’s also the possibility of reassortment within animals like cows, now that there are multiple variants detected in herds, she pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;At the same time, the CDC’s seasonal flu vaccination campaigns were halted on Thursday as the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; for “informed consent” advertisements instead. A meeting for the independent vaccine advisers was also &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;postponed&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The US has also halted communication with the World Health Organization on influenza data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The new spillovers into dairy cattle in Nevada and Arizona, detected through the new bulk milk testing strategy recently implemented in the US, are both related to the D1.1 variant of H5N1, which emerged in the fall and has come to dominate among North American birds. A teenaged girl in British Columbia suffered severe illness and a man in Louisiana died after infection with this variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In Nevada, a dairy worker was infected after close contact with cows, and genomic sequencing revealed a mutation that has been associated in the past with more effective spread among people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“These are more opportunities for the virus to continue to adapt, and with adaptation, you worry that we’ll ultimately get to a point where we may have a virus that becomes capable of transmitting efficiently between humans, and that then really would change the dynamic of the outbreak,” Titanji said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Lakdawala raised three theories for how bird flu keeps spilling over into cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The first would be a rare event in which fluids from a sick bird somehow came into contact with a cow’s udders – for instance, if a bird defecated into milking equipment. That was a working theory for the first spillover, detected nearly a year ago in Texas cows. But it’s rare for birds to have close contact with milking equipment, and for that to happen three times was “unlikely”, Lakdawala said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It’s much more common for birds to perch on feeding troughs, where their feces might mix with feed. Usually, cows infected through oral or nasal contact like this don’t see the virus spread to their udders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But it could happen in rare events – if a cow is unhealthy, for instance – that bird flu goes systemic and enters mammary tissue, where it replicates in enormous quantities, Lakdawala hypothesized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The third theory? People could be spreading the virus from birds, or another intermediate species, to cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Bird to human infections, we know happen more often,” Lakdawala said. “It’s more likely that somebody handling dead birds or chickens infected with H5 will become infected, and then it’s human to cow” transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All of these theories need more evidence and research, much of which is now threatened by halts in scientific funding from the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Two studies temporarily halted in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report have now been released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Blood tests on 150 veterinarians &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7404a2.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; three of the vets showed recent infection with H5N1. One of the infected vets worked in a state with no cases among cows, and the two others did not realize they had had contact with an H5-positive animal, indicating continued gaps in monitoring spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7405a2.htm?s_cid=mm7405a2_w" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on two households in Michigan indicated that dairy workers may have spread H5N1 to their indoor cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kevin Hassett, director of the national economic council, unveiled the Trump administration’s new strategy on CBS’s &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kevin-hassett-face-the-nation-transcript-02-16-2025/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Face the Nation&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday in a shift away from trying to contain the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Previously, officials “spent billions of dollars just randomly killing chickens within a perimeter where they found a sick chicken”, Hassett said. Infected poultry are culled in this manner because they are very unlikely to survive infection, and containment like this can help halt the spread to other animals – and to the people who care for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Hassett instead broached the idea, without providing more details, of using “biosecurity and medication” to “have a better, smarter perimeter”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian US</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 13:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE1kU21VcVJXSXdxa0JTaTJzN0JlWHRVWjFGMGFKTjJ6RnJRU3BzbDlhekdHRkV6UnhJRE1iTndhaXc5VEloTVNsWmp2MV9aR2ZnUWR0YVExQ3hRUzJQa0R5aDBBWFA4UjdsS1VQYXhFOThBbHUtd01j</guid></item><item><title>Do You Always Remember Your Dreams?

              &lt;p&gt;How frequently do you remember dreams? Have you ever woken up knowing you’ve dreamed but been unable to recall the details? It turns out that the ability to remember a dream might be influenced by a combination of factors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers in Italy spent the past four years studying “morning dream recall,” as it’s termed, publishing their &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-025-00191-z"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; on Monday in the journal&lt;em&gt; Communications Psychology.&lt;/em&gt; Their work explores how various traits and behaviors seemingly influence our ability to remember our dreams when we wake up. Understanding the dynamics of morning dream recall has significant implications for studying dreaming as a whole—a mysterious brain function that continues to evade precise scientific understanding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that dream recall is not just a matter of chance but a reflection of how personal attitudes, cognitive traits, and sleep dynamics interact,” lead author Giulio Bernardi, a psychologist from the IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, said in a university &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1073502"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “These insights not only deepen our understanding of the mechanisms behind dreaming but also have implications for exploring dreams’ role in mental health and in the study of human consciousness.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bernardi and his colleagues studied over 200 participants between the ages of 18 and 70. The researchers asked the participants to record their dreams and to wear a sleep monitoring wristwatch for a 15-day period. Before and after this period, participants completed tests and questionnaires on various personal topics, including their interest in dreams, tendency toward distraction, and anxiety levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers observed a wide range of morning dream recall abilities among participants, along with several potential influencing factors. For example, people with a self-reported positive view on dreams and a tendency to daydream remembered their dreams more frequently. The seasons seemed to play a role as well, as there was an overall higher rate of dream recall during the spring across participants as opposed to during the winter.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;People who spent more time in light sleep, as well as young people in general, were also more likely to remember their dreams. Older people, on the other hand, more often woke up with the feeling they’d dreamt, but were unable to remember the dream—a phenomenon the researchers called “white dreams.” Interestingly, their “observations support the notion that white dreams represent actual dream experiences, with memories of their content fading upon waking,” they wrote in the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Data collected within this project will serve as a reference for future comparisons with clinical populations,” said Valentina Elce, first author of the study and a PhD student in cognitive, computational, and social neurosciences also at the IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca. “This will allow us to move forward the research on the pathological alterations of dreaming and their potential prognostic and diagnostic value.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It’s worth emphasizing that dreams are self-reported, making the study vulnerable to biases. However, Bernardi, Elce, and their colleagues’ identification of potential influences on morning dream recall nevertheless sheds light on a mysterious brain function that has captivated humanity for millennia.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Sarah Blackburn wanted peace of mind. Instead, she got an appointment to have her spleen removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p class="primis-wrapper ad-wrapper"&gt;
      &lt;span class="ad-wrapper__text"&gt;Featured Video&lt;/span&gt;
      
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8YRKvXB/"&gt;now-viral TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, Blackburn recounts how she and her husband booked full-body MRIs at Prenuvo, a medical imaging company known for its early detection scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-full-body-mri-reveals-an-unpleasant-surprise"&gt;A full-body MRI reveals an unpleasant surprise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We scheduled to have them done in Dallas, which is about four hours away from us in Houston, and we were gonna make a trip out of it and we were so excited,” she said. But after some hesitation (“maybe we don’t really wanna know”), they canceled.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Eight months later, she finally went through with it at the new Houston location. “I was treating it like a spa day. I was so excited and like taking pictures in my little scrubs,” she said, raving about the experience. “Everything at Prenuvo was great. I got to watch Netflix, and the waiting room was nice and everything was super pretty and clean.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was also expecting a clean bill of health. Instead, she got a late-night results email that sent her into a spiral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-shocking-diagnosis"&gt;The shocking diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blackburn received her results four days later at 8:30pm. “I had nobody to call,” she said. Her follow-up with a nurse practitioner was scheduled within 24 to 48 hours, but in the meantime, she panicked. “I just went into a full-blown panic attack when I got my results and ended up in the emergency room because I needed a doctor to tell me what this meant.”&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The report? “One in three mortality rate,” she recalled. “Like OK, thank you so much.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prenuvo had found an aneurysm on her splenic artery, a discovery that quickly escalated after further testing. “I got a CT scan. There are actually two aneurysms inside of my splenic artery.” Yikes. The solution? “Now I am getting my spleen removed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-internet-reacts"&gt;The internet reacts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenters had a lot to say about Blackburn’s experience. Some shared how Prenuvo scans helped ease their own health anxieties. “I got it done and I have health anxiety and they didn’t find anything and it really helped my anxiety going forward,” one user wrote, to which &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8YRwQvn/"&gt;Blackburn responded with another video&lt;/a&gt; to soothe the qualms of hypochondriacs. Others, however, were more concerned with the price tag. “I wish insurance covered this every 10 years as part of preventative medicine,” another commented.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Her story even inspired others to book their own scans. One woman, who appeared to be a nurse, shared, “I just went today for a Prenuvo scan and the other guy waiting in his room said he was there because a girl on TikTok found an aneurysm and I said THAT’S WHY I’M HERE. You are sending us all!” Blackburn responded, “Wait this is the coolest thing I’ve ever heard. Following you now so you can update me on your results!” Keep us posted, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another user shared her heartbreaking experience: “My brother-in-law just died of a splenic artery aneurysm. He was 39 and extremely healthy. You are so so lucky.” Blackburn expressed her condolences and said, “I feel very fortunate that I can get it taken care of &amp;amp; you sharing this is such a big reminder of that.” If this isn’t a wakeup call to prioritize your health, nothing else is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-does-a-prenuvo-scan-cost"&gt;How much does a Prenuvo scan cost?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A full-body scan is about $2,500. Just the torso is about half that. And a head and torso scan is $1,800. It can detect aneurysms, cysts, hematomas, neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and dementia, metabolic disorders such as fatty liver, degenerative spines, and solid tumors as early as stage 1. Overall, it can &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/prenuvo-full-body-mri-scan-7693049"&gt;detect 500 conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Prenuvo scans are not covered by insurance, per &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/prenuvo-full-body-mri-scan-7693049"&gt;Verywell Health&lt;/a&gt;. As they note:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many radiologists have been wary of full-body imaging for decades. Major medical organizations, including the &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/collections/choosing-wisely/250.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American College of Preventive Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.acr.org/Media-Center/ACR-News-Releases/2023/ACR-Statement-on-Screening-Total-Body-MRI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American College of Radiology&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/medical-x-ray-imaging/full-body-ct-scans-what-you-need-know" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;, say there’s limited evidence that these preventive screenings are cost-effective or beneficial for healthy people. There are also no insurance companies that cover the service through companies like Prenuvo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I am truthfully doubtful of whole-body screening, for example, to detect a hernia. If the hernia is not creating any issue, I’m not sure detecting it is necessarily helpful. And many times, it’s unclear that anything needs to be done and it creates unnecessary anxiety in some patients,” Zhen Jane Wang, MD, a radiologist at the University of California San Francisco, told Verywell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-should-you-get-a-prenuvo-scan"&gt;Should you get a Prenuvo scan?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prenuvo offers full-body MRIs designed to detect early signs of cancer, aneurysms, and other potentially life-threatening conditions. But as Blackburn’s story highlights, the psychological impact of these results can be intense—especially for those prone to anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;“I have a lot of friends ask me if I regret it,” Blackburn said. I mean, she’s having a lifesaving surgery soon so that should answer that question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would she recommend it? “I was just a normal anxious girlie before this, and now I’m a normal anxious girlie with debilitating health anxiety that I’m trying to overcome.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blackburn did not respond to the Daily Dot for comment, but she did generously share a Prenuvo discount link in her bio for those brave enough to uncover the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarblackburn/video/7463201078146993454" data-video-id="7463201078146993454"&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is a syndrome associated with an ongoing decline of brain functioning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Different types of &lt;a data-content-type="section" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/health/" rel="Follow" target="_blank"&gt;dementia &lt;/a&gt;can affect people differently, and everyone will experience symptoms in their own way. However, there are some common early symptoms that may appear some time before a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neurology consultant Dr Tim Rittman has highlighted the challenges in distinguishing early-stage dementia from other conditions. Writing for &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/news/spotting-early-signs-that-could-be-dementia-when-should-you-worry/#author" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Alzheimer's Research UK&lt;/a&gt;, he said: "In its early stages, dementia can be difficult to tell apart from other conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"And that means it can be hard to know how much to worry if you think someone might be a bit different than when you last saw them. That's understandable – it's something many of us know very little about."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-content-type="section" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/newsletter-preference-centre/?view=Solus&amp;amp;mailingListId=d86974e2-8095-4ca7-b706-79c5ef9c4c60&amp;amp;utm_source=solusarticle"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Keep up to date with all the latest breaking news and top stories from the North East with our free newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A YouGov survey revealed that under half of the respondents (49%) could identify "memory loss" as a consequence of dementia. Merely 12% of the 2,162 participants were aware that dementia leads to a loss of independence, while almost a quarter (22%) admitted to being clueless about the impact of the condition on individuals, reports &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/health/doctor-warning-dementia-symptom-tv-9956025" rel="Follow" target="_blank"&gt;BristolLive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Rittman continued: "It's a surprising finding, given how dementia will impact so many of us". He emphasised the importance of raising awareness about early signs of dementia, saying: "It is important, then, to raise awareness of early signs of dementia so people with symptoms can be referred to a memory clinic for a full assessment and an accurate, timely diagnosis. "&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added that an early diagnosis allows individuals and their families to plan ahead, access appropriate care and support, and consider participating in research. Dr Rittman went on to highlight some key symptoms to be aware of, explaining: "When it first starts, dementia's signs and symptoms are often mild and not that easy to spot."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He noted that mild forgetfulness, changes in perception or speech could be early indicators of a problem. However, he cautioned: "It's really important to know that these kinds of symptoms can have other causes, such as low mood, or the side-effects of medications. But they could be early signs of dementia."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to Dr Rittman, issues with memory and thinking, common symptoms of dementia, might become noticeable when someone is watching television. They may struggle to follow the storyline of a favourite programme, finding it "difficult to follow".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said: "Early on forgetfulness could be mild, affecting memory for places or things that have happened in the past. You may notice someone asking the same question in quick succession, or struggling to remember the name of objects around the house. People may find they struggle to concentrate on daily tasks, or they may find following the storyline of a TV programme difficult for example."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Common early signs of dementia&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The NHS has listed some common early symptoms that may appear some time before a diagnosis of dementia. These include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;memory loss&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;difficulty concentrating&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;finding it hard to carry out familiar daily tasks, such as getting confused over the correct change when shopping&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;struggling to follow a conversation or find the right word&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;being confused about time and place&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;mood changes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; More information about dementia can be found on &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dementia/symptoms-and-diagnosis/symptoms/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;the NHS website here.&lt;/a&gt; There are also details about different forms of the condition, such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia as well as dementia with Lewy bodies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Chronicle Live</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 12:55:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPS2tWVm5lZElJRWV2MXpLR0VWVVFTZl9pRFZuWWt3c3dEbzFYWUhGdlhuRmdZcTRqbW13UWJvSkk3czNQQldrM1dYeHcxLXdjN3JvcHRFNktsc21kdXloZUx6QlhLS09OcXAwbFBjTTcwY3BXTmZ5THhubm1rdHJ3WUs1XzRQQVN2SFh4RGY0Z1_SAZYBQVVfeXFMTTV6T0d6YTZmRzZnWGNmcnJ6OUdhUWNfa3JiXy1SNjRVMVJvQ1FSeEM2b1lVeWRQT0RSa290SllOUGtJZ1RWT0dmU254VnVwbHNwcHM5VlBOcUx0T0pNQmdCTFlLaW9xbERvdDIxMG5hMHhPdmpMWlJ4aE5qYW1rSlNsa1FRWTVQSGtQbGVSd0JiUnVWV2pR</guid></item><item><title>News | Top RI Doctor Philip Chan Talks How Flu, RSV and Norovirus Are Hitting RI Hard - GoLocalProv</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxQRXZhOXd1NTlWb2s4Z0ZvN0dGdzRMRV9kQjZyaE0ta2hnT0pqWEVrRG0yRHdveDFCc1dKWmI0aWN5OVdFX3RYek9JR0E1Tk5BajR6LWZlcUI0MFM5TGZrdktyYTR0ZXptQy1yMEhuV2xVeEFVc3ZQTDhTNk92X3FkM1RqcUVlSHJ0aE51QnQzRU4xZWdETkRORV9rOWJlMkdvYjNuTkdtdllOMEV3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GoLocalProv</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 12:49:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxQRXZhOXd1NTlWb2s4Z0ZvN0dGdzRMRV9kQjZyaE0ta2hnT0pqWEVrRG0yRHdveDFCc1dKWmI0aWN5OVdFX3RYek9JR0E1Tk5BajR6LWZlcUI0MFM5TGZrdktyYTR0ZXptQy1yMEhuV2xVeEFVc3ZQTDhTNk92X3FkM1RqcUVlSHJ0aE51QnQzRU4xZWdETkRORV9rOWJlMkdvYjNuTkdtdllOMEV3</guid></item><item><title>Vikings suffered from severe oral infections and facial diseases - The Brighter Side of News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxNVktpU1hOeFZoVzIxcmxNTERzRkN1cmphd3Mtb2gwWXR3LW81ZkVub3hDaHJ3S0lfX1B1dkZhU1RBdlBYb0d3WFlla1BJOHFadnRNcWJ0LUY1akZDcWc0OTJld3VvYkQyQWoweDloaHJCMGRZT2pOMGtuOHVHSlByRTZFdFlhQVdSSzQ1cDNXZzJJdFc2bWo2OVdGYkZtMXNTaGNQYkdR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiBox-root css-a9h2n1" data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks"&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern technology is shedding new light on the health of Viking-era populations. Researchers at the &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt; recently used computed tomography (CT) scans to analyze skulls excavated from the Varnhem burial ground, one of Sweden’s earliest Christian settlements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings, published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41405-025-00309-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;British Dental Journal Open&lt;/a&gt;, reveal widespread signs of infection and disease among individuals who lived between the 10th and 12th centuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of CT imaging in osteoarchaeology allows scientists to see beneath the surface of ancient bones without damaging them. Unlike traditional X-rays, which provide two-dimensional images that can overlap, CT scans generate detailed three-dimensional images. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technology, first introduced in 1971 for medical diagnostics, has become an essential tool in paleopathology.

They examined the skeletal remains of 15 individuals and found evidence of chronic infections, degenerative diseases, and extensive dental problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="painful_lives_and_limited_medical_care"&gt;Painful Lives and Limited Medical Care&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Viking-era population of Varnhem suffered from a range of ailments, including sinus and ear infections that left lasting damage on their skulls. CT scans revealed pathological &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-3d-print-living-human-skin-and-hair-follicles-directly-onto-the-body/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bone growths&lt;/a&gt; in the cranium and jaw, indicating long-standing infections. Many of these individuals likely experienced severe pain without access to effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was much to look at. We found many signs of disease in these individuals. Exactly why, we don’t know,” said Bertilsson. “While we can't study the damage in the soft tissue because it's no longer there, we can see the traces left in the skeletal structures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dental diseases were also common. The analysis of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/worlds-first-drug-to-regrow-teeth-is-now-in-clinical-trials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Viking teeth&lt;/a&gt;, conducted in a previous study, had already revealed widespread dental caries and maxillofacial infections. The latest research confirmed that these issues often progressed to severe conditions affecting the jawbone. Given the lack of antibiotics or modern dental care, even minor infections could have led to long-term suffering or even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without the benefit of today’s medical knowledge, Viking-era individuals faced chronic pain with few options for relief. “Everyone knows what it’s like to have pain somewhere. You can get quite desperate for help,” Bertilsson noted. “But back then, they didn’t have the medical and dental care we do, or the kind of pain relief—and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/revolutionary-ai-discovers-previously-unknown-antibiotics-to-kill-lethal-bacterial-infections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;—we now have. If you developed an infection, it could stick around for a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="ct_imaging_preserves_historical_integrity"&gt;CT Imaging Preserves Historical Integrity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists and osteologists have long relied on physical examinations and traditional radiographic techniques to study ancient remains. However, CT imaging offers a non-invasive alternative that preserves skeletal integrity while uncovering new details. It is particularly valuable for studying intact skulls and undamaged bone tissue, where external examinations might miss key findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Pathological conditions and numbers of affected individuals.

In the case of the Viking skulls, the technique provided a deeper understanding of the health conditions these individuals endured. The ability to analyze bones in layers allowed researchers to pinpoint signs of inflammation and chronic illness that would be difficult to detect otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bertilsson and her team hope this study will pave the way for more extensive research using &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/ai/3d-body-scanner-breakthrough-uses-ai-to-predict-metabolic-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CT imaging&lt;/a&gt;. “Very many of today’s archaeological methods are invasive, with the need to remove bone or other tissue for analysis. This way, we can keep the remains completely intact yet still extract a great deal of information,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_glimpse_into_viking_age_life"&gt;A Glimpse into Viking-Age Life&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Viking-era remains excavated from Varnhem offer a rare glimpse into the past. Their well-preserved condition, thanks to the mineral-rich burial environment, has allowed researchers to study them in detail.

Quinoa is a complete plant-based protein, meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids that the body can’t produce on its own, Mygrant says. “It offers a unique advantage for those who are vegetarian or vegan.” &lt;strong&gt;A quarter cup of dry quinoa offers 6 grams of protein&lt;/strong&gt;, along with fiber, manganese, magnesium and iron.

As an alternative to simply sipping on the shakes by themselves, she suggests adding them to smoothies or coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.costco.com%2Ffairlife-nutrition-plan%252C-30g-protein-shake%252C-chocolate%252C-11.5-fl-oz%252C-18-pack.product.100727293.html&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Ffood-products%2Fg63844732%2Fhigh-protein-costco-foods%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:at;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt; at &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Kirkland Organic Greek Yogurt&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A 2/3 cup serving of this Greek yogurt contains 18 grams of protein&lt;/strong&gt;.

			&lt;p&gt;Just two servings of yogurt a week may protect the bowels from some specific types of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="152333" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, according to a new long-term study in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years now, scientists have suspected yogurt and its living bacteria have benefits for gastrointestinal health, and yet &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35692761/"&gt;not all research&lt;/a&gt; on the topic aligns on what those benefits are and when they are reaped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new analysis helps explain some of the confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, epidemiologists did not find a significant association between yogurt and the overall incidence of colorectal cancer – the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8276357/"&gt;third most common cancer worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when researchers split colorectal cancer cases into subtypes, they did find a significant result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings align with several other &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14122506"&gt;observational studies&lt;/a&gt;, which suggest yogurt intake may have anti-tumor properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study provides unique evidence about the potential benefit of yogurt," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/long-term-yogurt-intake-lower-colorectal-cancer-rates"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Shuji Ogino from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My lab's approach is to try to link long-term diets and other exposures to a possible key difference in tissue, such as the presence or absence of a particular species of bacteria. This kind of detective work can increase the strength of evidence connecting diet to health outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the results are only observational, they cover the health and self-reported lifestyles of 87,000 females and close to 45,000 males, tracked for three decades or more. Ogino and his colleagues' dataset encompasses a combined total of over 3 million years of individual follow-up data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer who consumed two or more servings of yogurt a week were 20 percent less likely to have a &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/i&gt;-positive tumor compared to those who consumed less than one serving of yogurt a month. This was especially true for proximal tumors in the upper part of the intestinal tract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifidobacterium"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are microbes that are ubiquitous in the human intestine and in the average bowl of yogurt. In about 30 percent of colorectal cancer cases, this bacterium is incorporated into tumor tissue, where it is commonly associated with a &lt;a href="https://www.wjgnet.com/1948-5204/full/v8/i12/819.htm"&gt;particularly aggressive form&lt;/a&gt; of the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152345" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152345" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Bifidobacterium-642x343.png" alt="Bifidobacterium Role" class="size-medium wp-image-152345" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Bifidobacterium-642x343.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Bifidobacterium-776x415.png 776w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Bifidobacterium-768x411.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Bifidobacterium-1536x821.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Bifidobacterium-2048x1095.png 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Bifidobacterium-600x321.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152345" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Role of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; in gut health.

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps counterintuitively, eating more &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium &lt;/i&gt;could help prevent this leakage in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article-abstract/18/4/858/683400"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sweetening-your-yogurt-with-honey-could-boost-its-probiotic-benefits"&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; the bacterium may have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune activation effects, possibly impacting the integrity of the gut microbiome and the intestine's semipermeable barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not yogurt can deliver these benefits will require further research, but observational evidence is mounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our finding suggests that yogurt intake might have a cancer-preventive effect for colorectal cancer with disrupted intestinal barrier," the authors of the current analysis &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2025.2452237"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Further studies are warranted to elucidate the potential mechanisms for the effects of long-term yogurt intake on colorectal carcinogenesis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152347" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152347" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/YangColonCancer-642x376.png" alt="Colon Cancer Graph" class="size-medium wp-image-152347" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/YangColonCancer-642x376.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/YangColonCancer-708x415.png 708w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/YangColonCancer-768x450.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/YangColonCancer-600x352.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/YangColonCancer.png 1262w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152347" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Locations of colon cancer.

These types of cancers are also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8276357/"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that food could work as preventative medicine is worth exploring further. A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.06.019"&gt;randomized trial&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 from Stanford University found that fermented foods like yogurt can influence the microbiome and immune system in healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemiologist Andrew Chan from Massachusetts General Hospital, who was part of the recent analysis, &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/long-term-yogurt-intake-lower-colorectal-cancer-rates"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; their paper "adds to the growing evidence that illustrates the connection between diet, the gut microbiome, and risk of colorectal cancer."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It provides an additional avenue for us to investigate the specific role of these factors in the risk of colorectal cancer among young people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2025.2452237"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gut Microbes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALDEN, N.Y. — People gathered Friday evening in Alden, in prayer and support for a young girl who is fighting for her life.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family of 9-year-old Mia Klyczek shared that she was taken to the emergency room on Wednesday, when she &lt;a href="/article/news/health/peak-flu-health-sick-people/71-be5b2981-71a0-448c-980c-4bddcc619183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;tested positive for the flu&lt;/a&gt;. This led to bleeding and severe swelling in her brain. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mia's mother shared Friday on social media that an MRL showed no blood flow to her brain and four dead areas. There is a go fund me page called &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/miracles-for-mia-klyczek" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Miracles for Mia Klyczek&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundraiser, as of Saturday morning, has raised more than $77,000 to help with Mia's medical expenses while she continues to fight her battle.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three people organized the fundraiser on GoFundMe, saying: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sean and Christina are overwhelmed and humbled by the love and support of their family, friends and community. They continue to need our prayers as their beautiful Mia continues to fight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mia went into the ER Wednesday morning, Feb 19th after a slight fever and vomiting. She started seizing and was sedated with a breathing tube to give her body time to heal. She tested positive for Flu B, which they think impacted her heart and later, bleeding in her brain. The swelling in her brain remains severe and the neurologists are continuing to do all they can for this sweet baby.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Their faith in God is strong and they are continuing to pray for a miracle. Many people have reached out asking how to help so some friends wanted to start this page to raise money for future medical bills while Mia continues to fight her battle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Almighty God, I humbly seek Your miraculous touch in every aspect of my life. Let Your divine presence be a beacon of hope and healing."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Protein powder is a &lt;a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/u-s-protein-supplements-market-107171"&gt;massive industry&lt;/a&gt;, worth around $9.88 billion as of 2024. By 2032, experts predict that number will more than double. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But according to one doctor, a popular type of protein powder—whey—has a backstory most people don’t think about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychiatrist and vegan activist Dr. Neal D. Barnard warns against whey protein powder in a viral clip from &lt;a href="https://maakadoodh.in/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ma ka Doodh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a documentary on India’s dairy industry.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The video, posted by Instagram creator Shreya Ghodawat (@sustainableteawithshreya) as a promo for her podcast &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3w8wket6Ik1vZSIPN23DH5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sustainable Tea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has racked up over 2.4 million views—and sparked a wave of criticism in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-wrong-with-whey-protein-powder-according-to-the-doctor"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s wrong with whey protein powder, according to the doctor?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nobody wants to tell these unfortunate bodybuilding customers why people are selling whey protein,” Barnard says in the clip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason has nothing to do with fitness, according to him. Instead, Barnard argues, it’s just the dairy industry finding a way to profit off what used to be waste.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;“They’re selling whey protein because when you take milk and you convert it into cheese, as the cheese becomes solid, you have all this water that’s left over and you have to drain it out,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That water is full of whey protein, and for a long time, dairy farmers didn’t know what to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They would bury it in a landfill,” Barnard claims. “They would pay people to take it away.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, someone figured out a way to turn a loss into profit.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;“Somebody found out a number of years ago that they could dehydrate it, put it in a tub, and put it on the shelf and say, ‘This will build your muscles,’” he continues.  “And sadly, people believed it and they buy it to this day.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s the junk of the cheese industry, and people believe it will help them,” he concludes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-this-true"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this true?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/how-protein-powder-is-made"&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;. Just as its name suggests, whey protein powder comes from whey—the liquid left behind when milk is separated to make cheese or butter.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;But while it’s now a staple in the fitness industry, whey has a much longer history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of whey dates back 7,000 years, according to &lt;a href="https://en.edairynews.com/whey-history-uses-and-its-role-in-the-dairy-market/"&gt;historians&lt;/a&gt;. Ancient healers like Hippocrates (460 BC) recommended it for infections, wound healing, and stomach ailments. By the 17th century, people were using it in soups and for making whey butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, the dairy industry treated it as waste, struggling to dispose of it without harming the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That changed in the second half of the 20th century. Thanks to technological advances, whey was no longer just a byproduct and it became a valuable raw material.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;And soon enough, the fitness industry started marketing it as a protein supplement, turning what was once discarded into a billion-dollar business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-whey-protein-powder-good-or-bad-for-you"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is whey protein powder good or bad for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most things in nutrition, it depends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-reasons-to-eat-more-protein"&gt;essential&lt;/a&gt; for muscle repair, hormone production, and overall health. For many people, especially athletes or those with high protein needs, protein powder can be a convenient way to meet their daily intake. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/is-whey-protein-good-for-you"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, most protein powders are safe when used in moderation, but they shouldn’t replace whole food sources like lean meats, eggs, or legumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, some concerns exist—especially with whey protein, such as calorie intake, dairy sensitivities, contaminants, and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the quality of protein powders varies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024-25 &lt;a href="https://cleanlabelproject.org/the-best-worst-protein-powder-products/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the Clean Label Project, a nonprofit organization, found that many popular protein powders exceeded at least one federal or state safety guideline for heavy metals, pesticides, and other contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The organization also maintains a &lt;a href="https://cleanlabelproject.org/product-categories/?refinementList%5BCategory%5D%5B0%5D=Health%20%26%20Fitness&amp;amp;query=Protein"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of certified brands that meet their safety standards for dietary supplements, including protein powders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the comments, users vehemently disagreed with the claim that whey protein powder isn’t “helpful” in building muscle. Most were also aware of where whey protein powder comes from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So all the peer reviewed literature and years of trial and error testing is all wrong because this guy in a lab coat with almost no lean muscle mass says so?” asked one user sarcastically. “Got it.”&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;“Milk contains whey, that is why you get whey when you make cheese,” explained another. “It is the left over part of the milk after taking the cheese. If whey is bad for you, everyone drinking milk would be in a whole lot of danger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just because it’s a part of the cheese doesn’t mean it’s no good,” stated a third. “Whey is in milk before we decide to make cheese. One more thing, science confirms that whey protein has a complete amino acid profile like eggs which is great for muscle recovery and muscle growth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have to add one last thing here – We know that Medical school teaches NO NUTRITION at all!!!” the third commenter continued. “So let us listen to those that dedicate their lives healing the human body with nutrition and not focusing on fixing the symptoms with medicine and big-pharma.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Daily Dot has reached out to Sustainable Tea with Shreya via email and Instagram messages for comments.&lt;/p&gt;

But there’s a catch—hepatitis B doesn’t infect mice, making traditional animal testing difficult. “The only animal that gets infected like humans do is the beaver,” says Dr. David, laughing. “And my team wasn’t exactly excited about going out to catch beavers by the river.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="3j1si" data-offset-key="60d9l-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="60d9l-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="60d9l-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Dr. David has always loved solving puzzles—both literal and scientific. “As a kid, I loved putting together tiny puzzle pieces.

                                    &lt;p&gt;When Jaime Bortz was a teenager, she'd gently take hold of her dad's hand while they walked through the mall in Buffalo, New York. She'd guide him along to prevent him from getting lost, as if he were the child, she the parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then her dad, Steve Bortz, went to live in a nursing home. Jaime, a high schooler at the time, was embarrassed to tell her friends where her dad lived. She knew she never wanted to end up in a place like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But time is making it harder for Jaime to live at home. She's 39 now. As the clock ticks on, the gaps in her brain widen, and she becomes more confused. Memories are rapidly slipping away, much as they did for her dad. She forgets how to dress herself, can't speak in full sentences, and cries a lot, perhaps because she's still aware enough to be frustrated by what's happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaime's half-brother Todd went through this decline a decade ago. A father to three young kids at the time, he started forgetting how to drive his own bus route, often getting lost with passengers on board. In a matter of a few years, memories of who he married, what he liked to eat, and even &lt;span&gt;his own shy nature&lt;/span&gt; were erased. He died of sepsis at 43. A year later, Todd's brother, Aaron, died at 40, with many of the same memory issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaime, Todd, and Aaron all inherited a rare PSEN1 gene mutation from their father that guaranteed they'd develop Alzheimer's at a young age. They are members of an unlucky tribe, the 1% of people with dementia who have early-onset familial Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even with the family history, no one believed that someone her age would have it," Bonnie Bortz, Jaime's mother and Steve's widow, told me when I visited her at home in Buffalo last year. By "no one" she meant friends, family, even some doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonnie&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;has been a default caretaker at every turn. As a young mom, she handled Steve's decline. Years later, she helped Todd's wife, Michelle, go through it. Now 64, she's the anchor of a bustling household, caring for Jaime and her 9-year-old daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am feeling desperate," Bonnie said. "I try to stay optimistic and positive, and I just kind of put on a harder exterior — I have to do what I got to do to get everybody through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonnie is foreshadowing the burden many families will soon experience. An article published in Nature Medicine in January suggests America is set to weather a cascade of dementia cases, a doubling of Alzheimer's patients by 2060. It predicts that by then, the country will gain 1 million new dementia patients each year.&lt;/p&gt;

                                    Bonnie Bortz (right), Jaime's mom, is her caretaker. Bonnie noticed early signs a few years ago. In her early 30s, Jaime started repeating herself a lot, and kept misplacing her keys and phone.

                            &lt;/span&gt;
                                  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                                &lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;/figure&gt;
                          &lt;p&gt;Families like the Bortzes are rare and warrant attention. There are just 45,000 cases like theirs worldwide. This small circle of people can offer researchers a glimpse into how Alzheimer's develops. Because they develop the first signs at early ages, researchers can separate the disease itself from other issues common among older people, like heart disease or type 2 diabetes. Early-onset cases have helped usher in a new class of Alzheimer's drugs, which have started to become available in recent years. While these antibody treatments don't cure the disease, they can slow its progression, buying families a little more time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there is much to learn. Researchers don't understand what causes the disease. Ultimately, there probably isn't just one kind of Alzheimer's that can be fixed by one single prescription. Families like the Bortzes show how far researchers still have to go in understanding dementia and developing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's like cancer," Fred "Rusty" Gage, who researches dementia and neurodegenerative diseases at the Salk Institute, told Business Insider. "This is not a single disease. There are different forms of it, and they're not just genetic forms versus nongenetic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="c4f9fdd2-677a-4a34-b18c-86b8beff37be" data-toc-id="c4f9fdd2-677a-4a34-b18c-86b8beff37be"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A 50/50 shot at dementia in your 30s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonnie knew something was wrong when Jaime moved back home in her early 30s. She kept forgetting her keys and phone and repeated herself a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The repeating of stories — that was definitely something my husband did," Bonnie said. "And it was subtle, little things." Jaime lost the insurance job she'd had for over a decade. Finally, around the time of Jaime's 36th birthday,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;they agreed it was time to get Jaime tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of dementia that runs in the Bortz family is genetically preordained. Someone who inherits a genetic mutation from one of their parents will almost certainly develop dementia, progressively forgetting what they've learned over a lifetime. It generally starts with short-term memories, then expands to erase aspects of who they are and how they function. People with this early-onset genetic form of the disease suffer a much earlier and faster descent than people with "regular," meaning sporadic, Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gage says that to categorically separate nongenetic forms of Alzheimer's from the forms that families like the Bortzes have is naive. Each person's genetics shape their case. &lt;span&gt;For example, roughly 60% of people who carry two copies of the APOE4 gene will develop Alzheimer's during their lifetime&lt;/span&gt;. (The actor &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chris-hemsworth-doesnt-have-dementia-isnt-retiring-alzheimers-risk-gene-2024-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;Chris Hemsworth&lt;/a&gt;, who carries a copy of the gene from each of his parents, has been open about his "4-4" status.) &lt;span&gt;Other folks, through some kind of genetic luck, can carry the same genes, and may even develop the amyloid plaques or tau tangles characteristic of Alzheimer's and yet never show signs of dementia.&lt;/span&gt; Of Steve's four children, only one did not develop his rare form of early dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's dozens of genes that have been found to be associated with Alzheimer's disease," Gage said. Few of them single-handedly control a person's cognitive destiny. If most dementia diagnoses are colored in shades of gray, the Bortzes' cases are harshly black and white.&lt;/p&gt;

                                    Researchers say Bonnie's family is rare and warrants attention as the number of Alzheimer's cases is set to double in the US by 2060, with few — if any — reliable treatments in sight.

                          &lt;p&gt;In 2023, as life at the Bortzes' house was getting more difficult, new Alzheimer's drugs were starting to become available. The blockbuster was Leqembi, a Japanese drug brought to market in the US, designed to clear out the clumps of protein, or amyloid plaques, that form between brain cells in people with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New drugs haven't been found to halt or prevent the disease, but data from one of Leqembi's clinical trials suggested it could slow progression down by about 27%. In practical terms, that means people might gain an extra four or five months of independence — of driving, perhaps, or cooking, shopping, dressing themselves, and remembering their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The pessimist would look at the data as it stands and say: 'Well, we tried that. It obviously doesn't work very well, so maybe we should start looking at something else,'" Gage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaime was on early Medicare for her disability. Legally she was still allowed to drive, but her mom took her keys away after she failed a driving evaluation funded by the Alzheimer's Association. It was getting harder to remember daily minutia, like the fact that her daughter likes peanut butter toast now, or how to put a paper filter into a coffee maker.&lt;/p&gt;
                          
                          
                          
                                 
                          &lt;p&gt;Still, Bonnie decided not to put Jaime on antibody drugs. She knew that they presented a small risk of brain bleeds and that Jaime, because she's a woman and because of her genetics, would be at a higher risk of developing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't want to cause more problems," Bonnie said. In 2023, Jaime was developing some muscle jerks, prompted by one of the other medications she was on. "I've never seen these medications help her in any way," Bonnie said. "Not with memory, not with anything."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of focusing on drugs that target amyloid plaques, scientists are starting to try new tactics. More than 100 new Alzheimer's drugs are in later-stage clinical trials. If those trials are successful, the drugs could become available to patients in the next couple of years. They include therapies designed to target neuronal tau tangles, which pulverize and kill brain cells from the inside, and others that go after the inflammation tied to Alzheimer's. Increasingly, doctors are wondering whether the anti-inflammatory effects of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/study-identifies-benefits-risks-linked-to-popular-weight-loss-drugs/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;GLP-1 drugs&lt;/a&gt; such as Ozempic and Mounjaro may prove effective against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would hope that we'd get to a good point where we look at where you are in the disease and we can fine-tune a cocktail," said Lindsay Hohsfield, an Alzheimer's researcher and associate professor at the University of California, Irvine, who cofounded a nonprofit called Youngtimers to support families like the Bortzes.&lt;/p&gt;

                                    Jaime is starting to forget things, like how her 9-year-old daughter likes her toast.

When I visited her at home in snowy Buffalo in early 2024, it was harder to tell something was amiss. She could carry on a simple conversation, exchanging pleasantries with a new houseguest — but if you spent more than a few minutes with her, you might notice her start to repeat questions ("Where do you live again?") or variations of them. Sometimes, she'd nod and quickly backtrack, insisting she already knew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reminiscing about old memories, like her favorite '90s TV shows or her pink prom dress, was much easier than recalling newly acquired information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked how her speech therapy was going, and she turned to her mom blankly. I can't know what was going on in her mind, but it seemed like she was scanning our faces for hints about how to answer and where the conversation should go next. Bonnie sensed the difference in her daughter, in the way a mother can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, sitting with me in the privacy of her SUV, Bonnie pointed out Jaime's repetition. That, she told me, is what it's like everyday.&lt;/p&gt;
                          
                          
                          
                                 
                          &lt;p&gt;Bonnie's been there through it all, managing the appointments, fighting to get Medicare payments, and evaluating which drugs and treatments to put her daughter on and which to skip. Driving often gives her some of her few solo moments of the day. She relishes going to work, rare time by herself. Recently she hired Michelle, Todd's wife, as an aide — a familiar face who can come help take care of Jaime for about 10 hours a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonnie tries to keep thoughts of the future to a minimum. Jaime's asked her, many times, not to put her in a nursing home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I pray to God it doesn't get to that point, because I would hate to do that to my daughter," she said. "With that being said, I am older. I don't know. I just, I don't know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonnie doesn't know how Jaime's condition will develop and what kind of support she'll require. Jaime has told Bonnie that her biggest fears are the nursing home and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The difficult thing about Alzheimer's, all brain diseases, if you truly wanted to reverse, you would also not only have to clear out disease, you'd actually have to build the brain back," said Dr. Nathaniel Chin, the medical director at the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. "This is not an infection where if you identify it, you kill it, you go back to being yourself. I mean, the disease has destroyed parts of your brain."&lt;/p&gt;

That doesn't stop her from being a mom — from trying to do something, anything, to help her daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man sometimes comes to her house for 10-minute sessions of cold laser therapy, designed to nourish and energize Jaime's cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're not working," Bonnie tells me, laughing out loud, probably realizing how ridiculous it sounds. Still, there's a quiet optimism. "Part of me is like, well, maybe we should keep trying, you know? As a mom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently Bonnie joined an online support group for families with early-onset familial Alzheimer's. There she got sucked into another tantalizing promise that a product could somehow help Jaime. She ended up sending about $600 to a man offering specialty herbal supplements before she realized he'd never send her any medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You get yourself suckered in because you want to believe that there's something out there," Bonnie said. She's also ordered expensive memory supplements advertised on TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a moment of desperation, while Todd was in decline in the early 2010s, Michelle sent a letter to Dr. Phil, begging for his help. Maybe this wasn't really Alzheimer's, she wrote. Maybe, hopefully, it was some other rare, undiagnosed condition that could be cured once it could be properly identified. "It sounds stupid, but I see that he does all these different testings," she said. &lt;span&gt;Deep down, she knew she wouldn't hear back, and knew he wouldn't be able to help. Still, s&lt;/span&gt;he's contacted Dr. Phil a few times since then, including once recently, worrying about what's in store for the next generation of the family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The throughline is a flicker of hope. Isn't there something that can help?&lt;/p&gt;

                                    Jaime's daughter is playful and doting. She also gets frustrated sometimes, watching her mom lose her grasp.

                            &lt;/figure&gt;
                          &lt;p&gt;Before Jaime's diagnosis, Bonnie was considering moving out of the house where she'd raised her kids and into a smaller home, enjoying a new empty nest. Now her old nest is full of boisterous daily activity again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaime is the last of her generation going through this rapid, fatal decline, but her young daughter is sometimes angry and embarrassed about her mom's condition. She lashes out — a kid grappling with losing pieces of her mother, one day at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michelle's 20-year-old daughter, Emma, wonders whether she should get tested before deciding whether she wants to have her own children. New genetic tests, in conjunction with IVF, are allowing some people with familial Alzheimer's to choose embryos to implant that don't carry the genetic mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to know, but then I don't want to know — I don't want to be worried about it all the time," Emma said.

It also won him a Pulitzer Prize. (Additionally, Yong’s 2022 book about animal perception, “&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/22/books/review-immense-world-animal-senses-ed-yong.html" title=""&gt;An Immense World&lt;/a&gt;,” became a best seller. A young reader’s edition will be published on May 13.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But despite having achieved a level of success and attention that most writers can only dream of, Yong’s immersion in Covid left him feeling as utterly depleted as many of the health care professionals and patients he was covering. So much so that in 2023, he decided to leave his prestigious perch at The Atlantic. Since then, in addition to working on a new book, he has found a measure of salvation, even transcendence, in birding, a pastime that he, like so many others, took up in the wake of those grim days of social distancing and time stuck inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So as we approach the fifth anniversary of the U.S. pandemic lockdowns, I wanted to talk with Yong about his Covid lows, his hopeful response to those struggles and his perspective on the lessons we learned — or maybe more accurate, &lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;didn’t &lt;/em&gt;learn &lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;— &lt;/em&gt;from that strange and troubling time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt;I want to start with a subject that a lot of people can relate to: burnout. How did you realize that you had given all that you had to give?&lt;/strong&gt; I remember talking to public-health experts for a story and hearing people say that they were feeling depressed, anxious, they couldn’t sleep, and thinking, Man, that feels very familiar. That was in June of 2020. By the middle of 2023, I realized that I was doing my best work at severe cost to all of the other parts of myself. I actually dislike the word “burnout.” It creates this image that the person in question did their job, the job was really hard and after a while they couldn’t stand how hard it was and they stopped doing it. Which I don’t think is correct. A lot of the health care workers I spoke to said that it wasn’t that they couldn’t handle doing their job. It was that they couldn’t handle not &lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;being able&lt;/em&gt; to do their job. They saw all of the institutional and systemic factors that prevented them from providing the care that they wanted to provide. For them, it was more about this idea of moral injury, this massive gulf between what you want the world to be and what you see happening around you. At some point that becomes intolerable. I think that’s much closer to my experience of pandemic journalism too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt;Do you have any answers for how to contextualize your feelings in a world where people are struggling for subsistence or with the threat of violence? I often think, when I’ll be low, What right do I have to complain? I’m sure you must have had similar thoughts. &lt;/strong&gt;This is a great point because you don’t even have to go to that extreme of folks who are struggling to get by, folks who are in the middle of war zones. Let’s just talk about the people whose stories I’m trying to tell. What right do I have to say, “I have listened to your stories, and I’m trying to write about them, and that, for me, is too hard”? Doesn’t that sound a little bit pathetic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 10:15:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5mSzAwTk9vYXg1dWRxUXUyMjZJcWR1YTlicWxoazRmRGQxRGtLMUFJLWlydjBFajFvZml1XzBzWV9WeGVJbnVRa1dReU1Wa0tTTGdjd2pHelpIOG9jQVlMcWwyTDZuZWE4ZTRDdVpaODRUUkRq</guid></item><item><title>5 Exercises to Improve Your Balance and Age Well - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTFBPclBjSTZaZmo0UEotZUFwLUotdEhOZk5ibFdMcWNNLXJvMURGdzE4a0t2dWw4M2JHYlBVT2w3ak1GcURHMk1vV2VoVmtoV0NUTVJBZEk1Y3MwNFgxNlF2UEFVb3ZDdjVMYkRPY0VfWmpWekVpbGRFekZiQ19ZQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Falls are the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/falls" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;second-leading cause&lt;/a&gt; of unintentional injury deaths worldwide, worldwide, with people over 60 suffering the highest number. While balance impacts both our longevity and our quality of life, it’s &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/12/well/move/balance-exercises.html" title=""&gt;an often-neglected skill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/56/17/975" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;A 2022 study&lt;/a&gt; by a team of Brazilian researchers found that 20 percent of the 1,700 older adults they tested couldn’t balance on one leg for 10 seconds or more. And that inability to balance was associated with a twofold risk of death from any cause within 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“There’s a downward spiral of the people who don’t go out, who don’t walk, who don’t exercise, who don’t do balance training, and they become weaker and weaker,” said Dr. Lewis Lipsitz, a professor of medicine at Harvard University and the director of the Marcus Institute for Aging Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The following workout was originally created as part of &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/12/well/move/balance-exercises.html" title=""&gt;an article offering a 10-second test&lt;/a&gt; to assess your balance. If you have tried the test (with a wall or chair nearby for safety) and didn’t pass, don’t panic: It’s never too late to start working on balance training. And even if you &lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; pass the 10-second test, it’s important to keep working on your balance, especially if you’re over 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Having a good sense of balance doesn’t have to mean handstands and acrobatics.

but less than half of Brits know about a major warning sign that one is about to strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chest pains and and being short of breathe are well-known red flags, but it's vital to watch out for lesser-known symptoms like a change in eye colour and swollen legs,  GP Dr Bhavini Shah has warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; One particularly bizarre sign is a phenomenon known as digital clubbing, which describes the thickening and widening of the fingernails. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It happens because oxygenated blood is not reaching the fingers, triggering the over-production of a substance that accelerates the growth of nail tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also relatively unknown is a grey ring around the outside of the iris, the coloured part of the eye.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 45 per cent of people over the age of 40 have this fatty halo around their iris, rising to about 70 per cent of people over the age of 60, research shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And its presence has been linked to coronary heart disease - as it may indicate that levels of cholesterol - the fatty substance that blocks blood vessels - are too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Shah, who is a medic with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://onlinedoctor.lloydspharmacy.com/uk/home-blood-test"&gt;LloydsPharmacy&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;span&gt; warned Brits to watch out for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;leg swelling, medically known as oedema.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Bhavini Shah, a GP at LloydsPharmacy Online Doctor, warned there are several red flags of heart disease that many people are unaware of. He warned Chest pain that feels like pressure, tightness, squeezing, or heaviness in the chest could be a symptom of a heart attack, and it’s essential to dial 999&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; It occurs when fluid builds up in the tissue - a result of a heart that is too&lt;span&gt; weak to pump blood effectively around the body, leading to a build-up in the veins and tissues of the legs and feet.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But less than half (46 per cent) of Brits are aware that this is a symptom of heart disease, a Lloyds Pharmacy survey of 500 Brits revealed.&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 2million people in the UK are diagnosed with some form of heart disease, according to Government figures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But charities estimate that a further six million have undiagnosed high blood pressure - one of the leading risk factors for stroke and heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's often caused by fatty deposits in the arteries that can make it harder for blood and oxygen to flow properly through the vessels and to and from the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This  increases the risk of a blockage, and therefore stroke or heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While some warning signs (pictured) are easy to spot — such as severe chest pain — others are more vague and hard to pinpoint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Less than half (46 per cent) were aware that leg swelling, medically known as oedema is a symptom of heart disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chest pain that feels like pressure, tightness, squeezing, or heaviness in the chest could be a symptom of a heart attack, and it’s essential to dial 999, Dr Shah stressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's the most recognised symptom with 80 per cent of people polled identifying it as a major warning sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shortness of breath is another, which 77 per cent of people know about.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Shah explained that if the heart isn’t pumping enough blood throughout the body, fluid may build up in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Irregular heart rhythms can also be an indication of heart disease, which 70 per cent of people were aware of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although this might not be directly linked to a serious condition, it’s important to get this checked to understand any underlying issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Extreme fatigue that makes day-to-day activities or mild exercise exhausting is another red flag. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But just over half (66 per cent) of people surveyed knew to watch out for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;More than 7.6 million people in the UK are living with heart or circulatory diseases, according to the British Heart Foundation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Shah stressed that there are lifestyle factors that we should all be considering to prevent the disease - and one is cutting down on fatty foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Reducing fat intake is an effective way to not only lower your risk of coronary heart disease but also help reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the NHS, a high-fibre, low-fat diet is recommended and should include at least five servings of fruit and vegetables, as well as whole grains (oats, rye and brown rice). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS also advises limiting salt intake to no more than 6g per day and avoiding saturated fats, as they can increase cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Staying active can reduce your risk of heart disease by up to 35 per cent, according to the British Heart Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Shah said it regulate your blood pressure and lower your cholesterol, whether walking, cycling, swimming or attending a fitness class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Quitting smoking can also cut the risk of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's because smoking damages the lining of the arteries, including the coronary arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition, a chemical called acrolein interferes with the body’s ability to process cholesterol, leading to higher levels in the bloodstream, Dr Shah warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking alcohol is also a risk factor of heart disease and Dr Shah said regularly going over the 14 units a week limit over 10 years can increase your risk of developing heart disease or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 09:11:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxPR283UjhWWm5rTnR6emRPZmtibEhkVGFoejZybW0yZjR2MnpCQy1WeTVaREZlQlR3bHlpbWlRUnJadUlSanZ4MGk5UzZIWHQ1RGlNck8tQnJkdDhnMG56dTZLd1duNV9FalBXUFQxOXlFeXBXUzZGZnZGaFIxWW1VVFlQVVZrbTRuemVpNUlfZnVKdzRINi1ncHBxZUV6ZHlsVGNzeTBB0gGrAUFVX3lxTE8zcVhXVlVFWlVwaGFNVnF4X2RwMnpMNmRNdm1sQWtCQ1VlaXBMWW1RTTBiTkNXWExxelg0Qkprb25ILTQyTHZZZzVNOUJVb3ZrM0lzdEhyTHBWLVRZTkdvNEl2bE5aMFJST3dHRThSYU9rLW5yVldKQ2ZBU1pISTJ1b0lfOGpxZFRiNWwtWk9xM3FjVy1MLVR4UmZkVTRCT2twVlhXUGxWNDN1RQ</guid></item><item><title>Arabia's rainfall was five times more extreme 400 years ago - Phys.org</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTFBRYV9WaG5pZWRycXptTzFVb212WUI3ZmhwOGY0b1NqbU9XajFuVVo3U2FvTEgwUy1HUGVqNVM0eWc3QUFmRndOM25VZEZ1MUhSQkNlSW85RkZaaU5oRmJaTlZsaXBTZDRkQ296andVRGR3d9IBcEFVX3lxTE1rQmdEU0tMNkxXblJldDFma29jbThHTFBETkdjZkc2MHJNa2podWJqUVJ4cVVGbUFnWWpJeTd3SnJQTnlVRHVERHliRmluLVp1V1YzWTYzQ0F5TENhLURBWTJOZldkRmtNVTVvTWcyVFU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study reconstructing extreme rainfall in Arabia has uncovered that rainfall in the region was five times more extreme just 400 years ago, highlighting the need for preparedness amid growing urbanization.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;The findings from the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science-led study suggest that the last 2,000 years were much wetter, with the region's climate once resembling a vegetated savannah roaming with lions, leopards, and wolves, unlike its present-day hyper-arid desert. The study was &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adq3173" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Feb. 21 in the journal &lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As major development projects like NEOM in Saudi Arabia continue to reshape the landscape, these findings underscore the critical need for enhanced &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/climate+resilience/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;climate resilience&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/disaster+preparedness/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;disaster preparedness&lt;/a&gt; to address the growing threat of extreme weather events in the region," said the study's lead author Sam Purkis, a professor and chair of the Department of Marine Geosciences at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) at over a mile depth deployed from the research vessel &lt;a href="https://oceanx.org/oceanxplorer" target="_blank"&gt;OceanXplorer&lt;/a&gt;, the research team extracted &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/sediment+cores/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sediment cores&lt;/a&gt; from a deep-sea brine pool in the Gulf of Aqaba, an extension of the northern Red Sea. The brine's chemistry preserves undisturbed sediment layers, providing a unique and highly accurate record of Late Holocene rainfall trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;They found that the last 2,000 years in Arabia were much wetter, with the region once a vegetated savannah and about 200 years ago, rainfall was double the current amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a key record to fill in the history of Middle Eastern climate. What it tells us is that the climate, both the average and the extremes, can change dramatically in this region, and the assumption of long-term climate stability in future development is not a good one." said Amy Clement, a professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Middle East is considered a climate hotspot, with increasing &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/flash+floods/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;flash floods&lt;/a&gt; from torrential winter rains, interspersed by harsh droughts, in Arabia causing widespread chaos and humanitarian disasters. The variability of Late Holocene rainfall highlights the need for better flash flood and drought preparedness and understanding future hydroclimate trends as the Middle East rapidly urbanizes. The &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/catastrophic+flooding/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;catastrophic flooding&lt;/a&gt; across the Arabian Peninsula in the winter of 2024 underscores the urgency of studying the frequency and triggers of such extreme weather events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Utilizing the technology on OceanXplorer in combination with multidisciplinary experts in ocean and climate science we can further our understanding of the linkages between ocean systems and long-term weather and climate trends, to help at-risk areas be ready for the future." said Mattie Rodrigue, science program director at OceanX.&lt;/p&gt;

Here’s what to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you have norovirus, you’ll get sick quickly but won’t stay sick for too long.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once exposed to the virus, you’ll come down with symptoms about 12 to 48 hours after becoming infected, said &lt;a href="https://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/profiles/faculty-staff/matthew-lokant-md/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Matthew Lokant" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b7880ee4b0cb1a004cad6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/profiles/faculty-staff/matthew-lokant-md/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Matthew Lokant&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease specialist at the West Virginia University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the hallmark symptoms is a rapid onset. Suddenly, you feel very nauseous,” Sweat said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this virus comes on quickly, it runs through folks pretty fast, too.

Kuritzkes&lt;/a&gt;, the chief of the division of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, said that the norovirus resolves on its own and is not life-threatening for most people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vomiting and diarrhea are the telltale signs of a norovirus infection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not hard to differentiate norovirus from other seasonal illnesses. It’s a gastrointestinal illness that’s marked by vomiting and diarrhea, according to Kuritzkes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also noted that people with norovirus “should not have any blood in their diarrhea, unlike some of the bacterial causes of diarrhea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you may experience other ailments that go hand in hand with vomiting and diarrhea, like stomach upset, nausea and cramping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlike colds and the flu, muscle aches and fever are less common in norovirus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It typically doesn’t cause fever, and so it’s not like when you have the flu or COVID, where you’ll have muscle aches and pains and upper respiratory symptoms like a runny nose or anything,” Kuritzkes said. “None of those things are common with norovirus.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, you can still get a fever or aches with norovirus, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to the CDC" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b7880ee4b0cb1a004cad6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. So if you experience those symptoms along with gastrointestinal issues, you might have the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The virus spreads through contaminated food, water and surfaces.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norovirus can survive on surfaces for multiple weeks, Lokant said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You could acquire the virus after coming in contact with everyday items — this could be contaminated food, contaminated water or contaminated surfaces like doorknobs or smartphones, especially when in close contact with infected individuals,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lokant also noted that infected persons “have the virus in their vomit and stool.” &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/causes/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="So, for instance, vomit particles can float through the air" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b7880ee4b0cb1a004cad6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/causes/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;So, for instance, vomit particles can float through the air&lt;/a&gt; and end up in a noninfected person’s mouth or on surfaces people frequently touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Outbreaks typically occur among people living in close quarters. That classic scenario would be an outbreak on a cruise ship, but other places to consider would be nursing homes or schools,” Lokant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also common for norovirus to be spread by food handlers, with Lokant adding, “Foods commonly involved in outbreaks include leafy greens, fresh fruits and shellfish,” while Kuritzkes noted that raw oysters from Washington state and Oregon “have been implicated in some of the current outbreaks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: RealPeopleGroup via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;RealPeopleGroup via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Thorough hand washing with soap and water can keep you from getting sick with norovirus.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norovirus is very contagious. Some of our standard hygiene methods don’t work against it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While alcohol-based hand sanitizers can kill viruses like &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/coronavirus" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="COVID-19" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b7880ee4b0cb1a004cad6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/news/topic/coronavirus" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, that is not the case for norovirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The norovirus actually has a protective outer shell, making alcohol-based hand sanitizers less effective than hand washing,” Lokant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Sweat, the key is to wash your hands carefully for 20 seconds and to disinfect any contaminated or potentially contaminated surfaces with a bleach-based solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also recommended avoiding touching your face while you’re out because “that’s how it typically would be spread. You might touch a surface and then rub your nose or your eyes, and then you can get infected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Sweat noted that if you’re taking care of someone with norovirus, you should wear disposable gloves and a mask when cleaning up after them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you get sick, hydrate, hydrate, hydrate. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main thing is to do your best to stay hydrated,” Kuritzkes said in regard to potentially contracting the norovirus. He suggested drinks like Gatorade or Pedialyte, which will replace the fluids and electrolytes you lose. It’s also important to minimize “solid foods or dairy-containing foods, which are going to be harder to digest,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the only other main action you can take is to let the virus ride its course. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no vaccine and there’s no specific antiviral therapy, so it really is just supportive care, which is essentially fluid replacement,” Kuritzkes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people recover in one to three days, but the elderly, immunocompromised folks and young children are at risk of severe complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Older people may have other medical conditions where becoming dehydrated may carry additional risks because of poor circulation or heart disease,” Kuritzkes said. “If you are unable to keep liquids down, and particularly if you’re starting to feel lightheaded or lethargic, that could be a sign of dehydration, and that would be a reason to seek medical attention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional signs of dehydration include dark urine and dry lips, Sweat noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re sick, you should isolate and avoid preparing food for other people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If there’s anybody in the household who has symptoms of norovirus, they should not be preparing food for others,” Kuritzkes said. “And then, if somebody has those symptoms, they, of course, should stay home from work until they resolve.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, folks should isolate from other people until they’re feeling well again, Sweat said. But even once you feel better, you can spread the virus for multiple weeks, Lokant warned. This is particularly true for immunocompromised people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do get sick with norovirus this season, you should stay away from others for at least two to three days after your symptoms go away, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/norovirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20355296" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to the Mayo Clinic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b7880ee4b0cb1a004cad6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/norovirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20355296" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;according to the Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.

And whether it’s surgical, chemical, or natural menopause, our experiences are much the same, and often hidden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="J-2pM ZfcXI iQkQu noPrint"&gt;&lt;span class="wekbt JWiCP tcU5i"&gt;&lt;span class="EaK8B"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="q4Eba"&gt;Loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need more awareness about premature and early menopause among women and health professionals because the knowledge gap may be leaving young women without the care and treatment they need,” says Dr Sarah White, chief executive of &lt;a href="https://www.jeanhailes.org.au/"&gt;Jean Hailes&lt;/a&gt;, an organisation dedicated to women’s health, with a particular focus on menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In Australia, there is still stigma around menopause, as culturally, we view it from a deficit-base: it’s a loss of youth, a loss of fertility. This is hard for all women, given menopause is inevitable, but it is really hard for those who experience premature or early menopause,” says Hailes, who believes there is a lot to be learnt from the disability sector in the way menopause is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She hopes to reframe these conversations to focus on the start of a new chapter, rather than loss and grief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="GJua6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Hy4HP z5wPE" data-testid="body-content"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Menopause and mental health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormones play a big role in our mental health, and this is true during every kind of menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Professor Jayashri Kulkarni AM, director of &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/medicine/her-centre/about-us"&gt;HER Centre&lt;/a&gt; and professor of psychiatry at Monash University, the impact of hormonal changes on the brain is often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People think menopause is an endocrine or gynaecological problem, when it’s actually a whole body change that needs to be worked with holistically,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hormones like oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone impact the reproductive system, but we have to remember these hormones are very potent brain steroids, and have different impacts on the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="GJua6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Hy4HP z5wPE" data-testid="body-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while these changes occur during every transition into menopause, the experience can be different for those of us going through it for medical reasons, especially for those of us who already live with mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="J-2pM ZfcXI iQkQu noPrint"&gt;&lt;span class="wekbt JWiCP tcU5i"&gt;&lt;span class="EaK8B"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="q4Eba"&gt;Loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I often feel tired and agitated, and struggle to think clearly. I also have mood swings, depression and significantly increased anxiety. Menopause amplified it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In natural menopause, there are decreasing hormone levels in the brain, but it’s a graded downward trajectory,” says Kulkarni. “Whereas in chemical or surgical menopause, it happens really fast and can have a greater impact on mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Kulkarni, the hormonal treatments many people are on, including me, may not be sufficient – something she says needs greater recognition from medical professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="GJua6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Hy4HP z5wPE" data-testid="body-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’s leading the charge for more clinical research, education and testing to improve menopausal experiences, especially when it comes to mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="_72JXS _0SAJQ mSNnk Wnq-J" data-testid="image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="qTXWa"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="_5nQzY"&gt;During chemical or surgical menopause, symptoms can have a bigger impact on mental health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite class="Zo2UY"&gt;&lt;span class="ALMCC"&gt;Credit: &lt;/span&gt;iStock&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I believe some of my difficulties also stem from a sense of loneliness. For a long time, I’d wondered how it would feel going through menopause at the same time as my mum, but she isn’t experiencing it yet. I don’t know anyone else who is going through it as young as I am, but I know we exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;An unexpected gift&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, chemical menopause has not been a source of sadness or grief, even as I prepare to have my ovaries removed and enter surgical menopause, which is permanent. Instead, my menopause to me signals freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="GJua6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Hy4HP z5wPE" data-testid="body-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know I will encounter other issues, such as an increased risk of osteoporosis and heart disease, but it’s worth the reward. The thought of never having a period again makes me want to sing with joy. It will make such a huge difference to my life, even if it means I need to be on hormonal therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s strange to go through menopause alongside people who are decades older than me, while many of my friends are pregnant and having babies, even though I’ve never wanted to have children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it doesn’t make me sad – our lives simply have different paths, and that’s OK. I would pay any price to have my pain reduced, even if it can at times be a bit of a bumpy ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Make the most of your health, relationships, fitness and nutrition with our&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; Live Well newsletter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="/link/follow-20170101-p56j6k"&gt;Get it in your inbox&lt;/a&gt; every Monday&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Sydney Morning Herald</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2wFBVV95cUxOeEhTdGpBUDByVmxWR0RhcXVpVXpqdkFqM0NZQjd4bjd5b2dKTmFSRVBtdVg5clpzVjNsb0JPU0ExYWg2T0Jpa1h6V2hXSENtUkJkcTJXYmtPOVJzNjRKejEwWkN3QUVaZnNFdVQ4S3hOdDlsNTFZYU1VSXFTem5nWDM5VlZaSTBMZWUzR3dYNUw1YTBROGF5NE4yTWwtZ3ktSzhUQmgxVnpwUkJWN1Nfc29ncFpsTzJSYnJ1T3p0NUVKQy1jY3d0UWVBRVRDekRINW9MbUc5WGI4OEU</guid></item><item><title>A personal trainer says she reversed her biological age by 4 years to 35.

Among other benefits, it can help prevent sarcopenia, or the loss of muscle mass in older age, which can make it harder to do everyday tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

She has since lost at least 30 lbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She cautioned that anyone considering the medications ‘must always go through a real doctor, though who knows what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Research is everything.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many people eager to try the groundbreaking obesity medicine find that their insurance plans will not cover the cost, which can be a high $1,200 per month. In that instance, they often shift to online prescribing platforms involving a brief medical professional consultation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medication typically comes from a compounding pharmacy, where pharmacists hand-mix it using its main ingredients. The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/fda/index.html" id="mol-0b494a00-f07f-11ef-8c8b-d5801fca125c" class=""&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; does not regulate this practice, so disingenuous or inattentive practitioners may use faulty ingredients or incorrect dosages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;2024 vs 2018: The 53-year-old reality star has shed more than 20 lbs thanks to the drug Mounjaro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Catania told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/811942/rhonj-dolores-catania-gets-real-about-the-menopause-and-marriage/"&gt;Hello!&lt;/a&gt; that the medicine has been ‘a life changer’ for her and her boyfriend Paul Connell, who has lost 60 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: ‘He no longer takes a certain blood pressure medication, and it's been really positive. There are side effects like nausea, but you take a pill for that.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clinical trials found that people taking Mounjaro could expect to lose around 15 to 20 percent of their body weight over roughly 72 weeks. The drug works best when taken with a healthy diet and exercise regimen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Catania shared that she used to be ‘a big carb person.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was Doritos, chips, onion dip. Now, it makes me nauseous. I absolutely don't eat that anymore.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She and her boyfriend also work out three to four times a week and while it can be hard to get herself moving, she said, ‘It's starting to feel good to me.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic was designed and approved to treat type 2 diabetes but has been &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12111857/Pfizers-diabetes-drug-results-similar-weight-loss-levels-Novos-Ozempic.html"&gt;prescribed off-label for obesity for years&lt;/a&gt;. Mounjaro was approved to do the same but was similarly prescribed to spur weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Much loved by celebrities, the drugs hit protracted shortages until just last autumn because people who would not necessarily benefit medically were snapping up supplies as soon as they became available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mounjaro contains the active ingredient tirzepatide that mimics hormones in the brain responsible for regulating appetite and feelings of fullness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To many body positivity influencers, the drugs’ meteoric rise in popularity reversed a slow, years-long societal shift toward body acceptance. It also sparked anger toward celebrities for what many saw as jumping on the thinness bandwagon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Catania said: ‘I kind of think I broke the seal on being honest about it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was also quick to tell people that, rather than taking the medicine for vanity reasons, she had a medical need for it: ‘I'm going through menopause, I have a thyroid issue, I have inflammation and weight is hard to take off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And I work out, and I don't eat crazy, and I was gaining weight, and it's a lot of different layers.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors often warn people that these medications are highly effective tools for weight management, but they are not a magic bullet for obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Amy Lee, chief medical officer at Lindora Clinic, a weight management company in Southern California, said: ‘You will acquire the symptoms of hunger and cravings that you had before starting the medication. Your body will return to the “baseline.”’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 study tracked 670 people taking tirzepatide for 36 weeks. People lost an average of 20 percent of their body weight in that time.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Afterward, half of the participants continued taking a high dose of tirzepatide for another year, while the other half received a placebo injection. Both groups also received lifestyle counseling, focusing on reduced calorie intake and regular exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The group that continued tirzepatide lost an additional 5.5 percent of their body weight on average, while those who switched to the placebo regained 14 percent of their weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The placebo group also showed increased cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure levels compared to when they were on tirzepatide, according to Dr. Louis Aronne, the study's lead author and director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 06:45:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQNEhBb1lMRm15M0NoVllxSk5TbFBCX2dVSXlXOXo2bkoyQzdNcTE3dzM1V3RUc2U1Q3NCUGwtUTU5X19TdUEyN0tKRHJMeGFNcEZNX2lpd3BaVUFTQWlQOEotUlhIc0N5Z1gyT2hBd3RqWXltVzFNdnFFMnJqNFcwYXpoMGZRSXNzMnpOd2twYXRCdXdUcVhaTXBJcU9ZaDJvUXhJNkRR0gGrAUFVX3lxTE02RE9OOEpjdXBOdC1KUmRjcnNxRUNCY2tWYVZwQjdkYVlkZ21IV3JPYm1SQ1g5a2xoV2hmVFdqWjhTNXRJTjVUY3Fyb0hYRnV3ME5CZ0w3U1RFM1M0YUd0bjhwZS1RU29EWEk4WEhhdkZ3OGtwcUkwNWJMM3BodzdqS0pOU3IxSjYwd09ZR0ZIbmFNemhJeE04S1BDMTVOZzZmVHJEUnFmUW1iMA</guid></item><item><title>Yale scientists who risked careers to publish bombshell Covid vaccine study issue message to shot's victims - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxOSEMtcEtVMDQ5aTVCZUo0LW9COFVkNWFob2NjVHZnaG1Nc2lSYnVMTHFjTEVSMVJMTDhpdlhtZjQxSjZlTEJIRjJ2ajZfRXdnVmJETVRzUzFsYV9hMnA0cW1YYlh0MG1fek1Zbmo4ZkdRTndLbldUZmlrNmtwUnRJOVB0MnMtOWc1UzJlWW5sdmJtR0Eyd2NCVkJQMWNBbHB3V2ZETXBtMk4zV0pC0gGyAUFVX3lxTE1JcFN1S3A4NHRlX1dtNWlBTjhDQ0txbUJPT0luaWRtM0x6YUpQMkE4YjlzQjExTWlWRkpQQlotNEhhQXBLNUtQMjBLMVZpbF9rZHdoQ0s4Q2dQeEx6dEk3Rm1jbFNZNmNFMUdYQU50eURUdy1yV0FNVW1CZERGQTJ4T0Q4UVhaZ040NWROUV9uNkJzU196dUxHZ1VINHdhN2ZyRVl5c01Cb2dlRlBBQUhmblE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Akiko Iwasaki is one of the lead Yale University experts researching 'post-vaccination syndrome' following Covid vaccines.

He is pictured with his two children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kari Ponce de Leon, a 43-year-old mother-of-two from Montana, told DailyMail.com that she 'can't really trust the public health institutions anymore' after her Covid vaccine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People with PVS have felt dismissed and ignored because PVS is not a medically recognized condition,' Dr Iwasaki said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I believe that rigorous scientific research will lead to better diagnosis, treatment and prevention of PVS. Such research will also lead to better transparency and safer vaccines.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Iwasaki and her team emphasized the results 'are still a work in progress,' and that it is unclear exactly how common PVS is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Iwasaki, who is the director of the Center for Infection &amp;amp; Immunity at the Yale School of Medicine, said the team planned to address this question by launching larger studies.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We would like to expand our research to a larger cohort and validate our current findings,' she said. 'We need funding to carry out such future work.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC still &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-10161467/Veterans-not-vaccinated-said-worried-effects-newness-shots.html"&gt;recommends Covid vaccines, especially for those who are elderly or immunocompromised and vulnerable to the disease.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid is also still &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-8239461/Confirmed-coronavirus-cases-surpass-800-000-death-toll-hits-42-940.html"&gt;killing about 300 Americans every week&lt;/a&gt;, CDC data shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following the new research, DailyMail.com spoke with dozens of Americans who report being injured from the vaccines and have expressed hope that their symptoms are being validated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of them was Kari Ponce de Leon, a 43-year-old mother from Montana who decided to get the Pfizer Covid vaccine in February 2021 out of a sense of duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, what she thought was a good deed turned into a years-long ordeal with dangerous blood conditions that could have caused deadly bleeding.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother-of-two told DailyMail.com: 'I thought that I was doing the right thing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She stressed that while she's not anti-vaccine and has 'had all the vaccines that I can,' she does feel the government abandoned her after mandating the shot. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I've never had a problem before. I've had all the vaccines that I can. My kids are vaccinated. I believe in vaccines.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just two days after her vaccine, she noticed red spots all over her hands and an uncontrollable nose bleed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors diagnosed Mrs Ponce de Leon with a series of blood conditions that caused her immune system to block platelets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Platelets are essential for blood to clot and for wounds to heal, so having too few could lead to uncontrolled, deadly bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After months of infusions to get her platelets back to normal, Mrs Ponce de Leon was rushed to the University of Washington in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors replaced all of her plasma with donor plasma where doctors performed plasmapheresis, a procedure that removes all of the plasma from blood and replaces it with donor plasma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Keyler is pictured before his injury with his wife and their two children. He said while he plans to get his children most vaccines, he is cautious about giving them Covid shots&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lindy Ayers, 31, was a military veteran, triathlete, and skateboarding competitor before she was left wheelchair bound after her Covid shot. She is pictured at left before the injury and at right after&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Ponce de Leon has fully recovered, but doctors were unable to offer an explanation for her conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One doctor wrote in a letter that her condition was likely caused by the vaccine 'because he couldn't find any other reason.' &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the Yale study, participants with PVS had reactivated Epstein-Barr, a contagious virus that can cause flu-like symptoms, swollen lymph nodes and nerve issues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It has also been shown to attack the blood and marrow, which may have explained Mrs Ponce de Leon's sudden blood disorders. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She told DailyMail.com that while she supports vaccines, she is cautious about supporting treatments heavily touted by government authorities.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She said: &lt;/span&gt;'It's just very frustrating with this one because I did what I thought I was supposed to do.

Such research will also lead to better transparency and safer vaccines.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Iwasaki and her team emphasized the results 'are still a work in progress,' and that it is unclear exactly how common PVS is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Iwasaki, who is the director of the Center for Infection &amp;amp; Immunity at the Yale School of Medicine, said the team planned to address this question by launching larger studies.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We would like to expand our research to a larger cohort and validate our current findings,' she said. 'We need funding to carry out such future work.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC still &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-10161467/Veterans-not-vaccinated-said-worried-effects-newness-shots.html"&gt;recommends Covid vaccines, especially for those who are elderly or immunocompromised and vulnerable to the disease.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid is also still &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-8239461/Confirmed-coronavirus-cases-surpass-800-000-death-toll-hits-42-940.html"&gt;killing about 300 Americans every week&lt;/a&gt;, CDC data shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following the new research, DailyMail.com spoke with dozens of Americans who report being injured from the vaccines and have expressed hope that their symptoms are being validated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of them was Kari Ponce de Leon, a 43-year-old mother from Montana who decided to get the Pfizer Covid vaccine in February 2021 out of a sense of duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, what she thought was a good deed turned into a years-long ordeal with dangerous blood conditions that could have caused deadly bleeding.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother-of-two told DailyMail.com: 'I thought that I was doing the right thing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She stressed that while she's not anti-vaccine and has 'had all the vaccines that I can,' she does feel the government abandoned her after mandating the shot. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I've never had a problem before. I've had all the vaccines that I can. My kids are vaccinated. I believe in vaccines.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just two days after her vaccine, she noticed red spots all over her hands and an uncontrollable nose bleed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors diagnosed Mrs Ponce de Leon with a series of blood conditions that caused her immune system to block platelets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Platelets are essential for blood to clot and for wounds to heal, so having too few could lead to uncontrolled, deadly bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After months of infusions to get her platelets back to normal, Mrs Ponce de Leon was rushed to the University of Washington in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors replaced all of her plasma with donor plasma where doctors performed plasmapheresis, a procedure that removes all of the plasma from blood and replaces it with donor plasma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Keyler is pictured before his injury with his wife and their two children.

In total, 74 participants successfully completed all stages of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study found that participants who took the sulforaphane compound experienced a greater average reduction in fasting blood sugar levels compared to those who received the placebo.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between the two groups was significant. An even more pronounced effect was observed when examining specific clinical subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greatest improvements were seen in individuals with early signs of mild age-related diabetes, a relatively lower BMI within the study’s context, low insulin resistance, a low prevalence of fatty liver disease, and lower insulin secretion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior researcher &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/research/anders-rosengren" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Anders Rosengren, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, from the University of Gothenburg explained the key findings to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;. He told us:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have found that sulforaphane, a compound that is highly contained in cruciferous vegatables such as broccoli, reduces blood glucose in individuals with prediabetes, i.e. a pre-stage of type 2 diabetes. In early stages of diabetes, the glucose production from the liver is increased. Sulforaphane interferes specifically with increased glucose production and reduces it. By doing that, fasting blood glucose is kept at lower levels, which is beneficial.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also found that a subgroup of people with mild obesity and well-preserved insulin secretion has even larger effect,” Rosengren added. “Moreover, we found that individuals who have high abundance of a specific gut microbe that converts the inactive precursor to active sulforaphane have increased effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This opens an avenue for precision treatment of prediabetes to those who benefit most,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the third part of the study, researchers also studied gut bacteria. They found a specific type of bacteria that interacts with sulforaphane and seems to make it more effective at lowering blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, people who took sulforaphane had fasting blood sugar levels that were 0.2 millimoles per litre lower than those who took a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a specific group of participants — individuals with mild obesity, low insulin resistance and reduced insulin secretion — the difference was of 0.4 millimoles per litre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greatest drop, 0.7 millimoles per litre, occurred in people who were part of that group and also had a particular gut bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Prediabetes is estimated to affect 5-10% of the adult population,” Rosengren explained. “Most people don’t know about their condition but it can be suspected if you have relatives with type 2 diabetes, eat unhealthily and have limited exercise and high BMI [body mass index].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lifestyle changes is a cornerstone but we also need additional complements. Sulforaphane can be provided as a functional food and thereby open up a new form of treatment for prediabetes. It is difficult to eat pure broccoli to reach the levels used in our study (you would need several kilograms per day) but it can be achieved by broccoli sprout extracts. As a consumer you have to be careful as the content of sulforaphane vary widely in marketed products. We used [a tool called] &lt;a href="http://diaopt.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Diaopt&lt;/a&gt; in order to achieve the proper amounts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Anders Rosengren, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rutsunutrition.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Haley Bishoff, RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;, a plant-based registered dietitian and owner of Rūtsu Nutrition in Las Vegas, not involved in this research told MNT that “sulforaphane is a powerful plant compound in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli,” and that “it is well known for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cancer-fighting properties.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The [current] research showed potential with broccoli sprout extract and its ability to help lower blood sugar levels. However, the most benefit was seen in people who already had low insulin resistance and healthy gut microbes,” Bishoff explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“First and foremost, it’s important to understand that prediabetes is often preventable and reversible,” Bishoff explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many medical professionals are focused on treatment with medication, versus prevention as a primary approach. People with a healthy gut microbiome also tend to respond better to diabetic medications and see improved blood sugar control, compared to those who do not. This is another great reason to always prioritize a healthy lifestyle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Haley Bishoff, RDN, LD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An imbalance in healthy gut bacteria can contribute to elevated blood sugar and insulin resistance,” she added. “To maintain a healthy gut, it’s important to reduce eating ultra-processed foods, refined carbohydrates and high saturated fat foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eating a diet rich in prebiotic fiber, fermented foods and food in its natural form will help maintain an overall healthier gut microbiome,” Bishoff advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.topnutritioncoaching.com/weight-loss-nutritionists#courtney-pelitera" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Courtney Pelitera, MS, RD, CNSC&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian specializing in sports nutrition and wellness nutrition, also not involved in the study, said that “overall, the study shows that the [broccoli sprout extract] did not benefit blood glucose levels as much as originally predicted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, it did help to reveal that the health of the gut microbiome correlates with effective blood glucose control. Those that had a healthier gut microbiome were more likely to benefit from the [broccoli sprout extract] with a more effective fasting glucose response,” she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study could have bigger implications later on when we have more research in identifying exactly who will benefit from broccoli sprout extract as a treatment for prediabetes. “I think in my own practice, I would use this information to encourage patients to focus on having a healthy gut microbiome,” Pelitera explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can do this by including a wide variety of fruits and vegetables in the diet along with whole grains. This helps to provide both soluble and insoluble fiber and prebiotics, aiding in the improvement of the microbiome. Also, including [fermented] foods, such a yogurt, kombucha, kimchi, pickled foods, and cheeses adds probiotics and probiotics coming from whole foods into the gut microbiome. I would encourage adding these types of foods into the daily diet before supplementing the broccoli sprout extract.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Courtney Pelitera, MS, RD, CNSC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 06:33:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxOSW5aNk5TOUFtcnhpbGVCemsxT1NaZEl5S09DR1ZuRm1OQllEOXVwY1lPTU93aTdreUt3ZldUU2FycVd5ZEpwdFo1NGlrbXEyTEx2VzhJclZ3aGxDNjB4TmxYcHFqNXc4allBSndMd0NXcTdyOEQwdXlRcW5od1J6bGhsMDlMeVM5UjBES25iMHNucFBzQWVN</guid></item><item><title>7 best workouts for longevity and anti-aging - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1wFBVV95cUxNY3I2WUFQUW5nT2lWQktNTHNYNVR5dXFzRHphb3RtSC1mOVVLQS1GanN5aEVCNy1NNHBkOURDc1UwSlRValMxS3J4enRNTzUzeWF4YUVDUkRpQUxiQm84eDdsWkNOaFpCeWN3UF9RTXhBeVRVVXhhWGllMmVIdVpTR2w2UEJPc1ZTS0xoS2o4T04yaUhaaWdoYXVsQWp5Uk1qZ2dyeGRsNk1aQ055MFJDMm5TblBBUU5JR0kwbTRzclZqblVWb2hReElqckxBaHp1bTJvV1NxTdIB3AFBVV95cUxQSEQ1WVp5TTAzMVdpMVpEWXRGUVhtcWY2Q2tsTVNJa2hvWnJQSXR4V1d5SE5aelFHQXVlTmZTR3JsNXotY1BORmJTREdBb1Q0bVBoVTJkbjNOWUt6TVlVNFRaU2NISFJDZ2U4czRhU0pGd1JXbzRGaG5vOWQ0S1dhXzkzRjJfS2NKdThRd25MYkt1NEE0ZVcwcmd1aTNWZ0w3cHl4Q3NzTUxmOEZEVHB2Ykk1bEoyOXlvRUp3ckJyaDhXVVk3YmY0YlMzaGJ6NkMzUE9yTHNGTGNPLUNJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longevity is a tricky term. It’s not just about genetics or a stroke of good luck; it’s all about balance. Many things come to mind when we speak about longevity. One would be the brain and its cognitive prowess. Then we have the heart, which is the number one killer, followed by cancer and metabolic diseases like diabetes. These metabolic diseases essentially wreak havoc on your body at a systemic level. An overload of blood glucose can reach toxic levels, thereby damaging all cells in its reach. It’s a silent killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Asad Hussain, Founder and CEO of OddsFitnes, “Longevity is all about balance. This is a curious statement as it explains why the longest-living individuals lead the most balanced lives. Their existence isn’t tilted in pursuit of anything extreme. While there are exceptions, statistically, longevity appears to be a direct reflection of balance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first and foremost disease that most Indians encounter is diabetes, and to help deal with it, strength training is highly recommended. Strength training not only enhances your ability to store glucose within muscle cells because of increased muscle mass (hypertrophy), where it is stored as glycogen but also makes cells more receptive to receiving glucose (by enhancing GLUT4 sensitivity) and disposing of it through anaerobic glycolysis (the mechanism involved in breaking down glucose for energy). This prevents the cells from being exposed to excess glucose, which should not exceed 240 mg/dL for prolonged periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does this prevent cell damage, but it also reduces the risks of all the other diseases mentioned. It is recommended atleast three 30-40-minute sessions per week of strength training. Just one session is enough to reduce HbA1c by 1.1-1.3 percent over three months without any other interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Divya Sakhalkar from OddsFitness elaborates: “Think of glycation as caramelizing your body from the inside out. Cutting down on sugar and moving more can help prevent it. Oxidative stress and glycation accelerate aging unnecessarily, but exercising correctly and eating smarter are the best anti-aging remedies. Imagine your body ‘rusting’ from the inside - exercise keeps it polished and running like new. Too much sugar gums up your cells and makes you age faster, but exercise helps clean up the mess. Strength training is your best defense against glycation. Your body is like a machine—too much sugar clogs the system, but movement keeps it running smoothly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to cardiovascular diseases, most people assume that a heart attack is a sudden and acute event that probably happens due to bad luck or factors outside our control. However, cardiovascular disease can literally begin at the young age of 20, taking decades until your coronary arteries (which supply blood to the heart) start getting blocked. Exercise, especially cardiovascular exercise, not only ensures that you have healthy blood vessels but also helps the heart develop an enhanced cardiac output. Endurance-based exercises increase left ventricular volume, reducing the number of times the heart needs to contract by increasing stroke volume. A healthier heart and healthier blood vessels can be achieved through cardiovascular exercises, and 150 minutes of zone 2 (120 beats per minute) cardio per week can be divided into three 50-minute sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, cancer, which many attribute to bad luck, is a misunderstood disease. Having great metabolic health, a lower inflammatory state, a robust immune system, and a healthy lifestyle in general—all of which can be achieved through exercise—can help prevent and also increase the chances of survival from this disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the study say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the NIH (National Cancer Institute), excess body fat, especially visceral fat, increases inflammation in the body and creates hormone dysregulation, both of which create an environment that increases the risk of 13 different types of cancer. When it comes to cancer, exercising not only helps regulate body composition, but it also improves immunity, which helps inhibit tumor growth. Exercise enhances mitochondrial health, which boosts metabolic flexibility, allowing cells to efficiently switch between fuel sources. This optimized metabolism minimizes the excessive accumulation of biosynthetic intermediates and reactive byproducts that, if elevated, could create an environment conducive to cancer cell growth. By practicing a well-rounded fitness routine, you can ensure not only the prevention of cancer but also reduce the risk of death due to cancer cachexia, which now accounts for 20-30 percent of cancer-related deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer cachexia is a condition where a person loses weight drastically, especially muscle mass, wreaking havoc on the metabolic and mechanical functions. It is highly recommended to exercise to maintain healthy body composition. A well-rounded fitness routine that includes at least 100 minutes of cardio-based exercises, zone 4 (threshold training) to enhance vasculature and oxygen delivery, three days a week of strength training (to build muscle reserve and improve metabolic health), and two days a week of yoga (for mindfulness and a regulated autonomic nervous system) is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, regarding the brain and cognition, all the above-mentioned modalities help with brain vasculature, health, and size. Engaging in racket sports stimulates decision-making and critical thinking, thereby keeping the brain active. Racket sports like badminton, tennis, and squash, combined with a well-rounded strength training and endurance protocol, help create new synaptic connections and neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Types of workouts to do to reverse ageing&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, a balanced exercise regimen that includes zone 2 (cycling, brisk walking, jogging) training for at least 130 minutes and strength training (which trains all major muscle groups) three days a week—using exercises like leg press, military press, bench press, squats, push-ups, pull-ups, and rows—helps train all major muscle groups, improving functionality. Additionally, practicing yoga two days a week ensures a long life and a better quality of life. All of these come together to reduce the risk of diseases and, more importantly, improve balance, gait, steadiness, proprioception, strength, and flexibility, making sure you not only live a long life but your best life, where all your long-term narratives require you to be a functional and disease-free individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Secrets to anti-ageing: 7 simple daily habits that give us healthy skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 05:46:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>US doctor explains how just 10 minutes of walking can increase life span - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi_AFBVV95cUxPbTYyb29oRjRrMUotTVEyRjktcXhYcE4xaVIyaTNmOXdwTkxQR1Q2eXY5eTRLeXBTb3hjbVpDMXZ3emJPQ2FTMTJ3dVBKYmxGQklfRW1OcGxtOTg1RzI4eHEzV2V6NFdzbDNOUnRrTGJQX1VhRl9hMWZieEt4YmcySE8tZWY4R196TDE4UzdVYWxHdy1KdzFlSXFEWndYVE9rM05lYWQ0TW1UNFV5WnpSQXdkdjJ2dUJ0dm9ZSDBVNXQ0Q2Q0VEJiWEhNODctYkZyM2VudzJ2emdNQ0FSUDh4U1dJYm5yVkZSOXJ2X0JNUjJscEpBQW5tWEdHNl_SAYICQVVfeXFMTTRUVWZuNVpKNnJCckpXZkx3VjNYVGRBRVlKakp2QWlLdTZ1TEp3YVh1bUlTcTVidVpONlBOYWlrUzZzb3dKeEdFZ1FwUUs0VjJMS1ZPVGlCR1pOYm9jT2FGakhickFGeU9vLUVRYzBYTmx4ZXAxdEwyTDBJdHlTSGhZR3lRVXVZOEhYYUdmRGtCTDhnbmxLdkRfRTNaZGk2QUpCQmxUZ3NCQ0hxZ2Z0Q2VVTzh1eGpoVDFlN3hSQW1NQjZrWUJ5UWVKN2hJQnVPQ2lRWWduWUwzSUg4aWZVVFNVaWR2YXhGM0ZCYWc3bnl5TXZvX2J4RGpqN29tckR4cHNR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity has a deep impact on the overall well being including the longevity of an individual. Several studies have suggested the importance of daily movement for as small as just a few minutes in controlling the important parameters of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, Cleveland Clinic's Senior Medical Advisor, Mark Hyman took to Instagram to share the findings of two important studies and to aware his fans and followers about the importance of walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“Daily movement isn’t just about fitness; it’s about longevity”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing the highlights of the study, the expert writes, "A study published in The Lancet followed 47,000 people over seven years and found that walking can significantly lower the risk of death. For adults 60 and older, the greatest benefits were seen at 6,000 to 8,000 steps per day. For adults under 60, the sweet spot was 8,000 to 10,000 steps per day. Daily movement isn’t just about fitness; it’s about longevity. Start where you are and build from there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mark’s post has received positive feedback from his followers. "Love this reminder! Every step adds up to a healthier, longer life. Time to lace up and get moving! Who’s in?," writes one user. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Could not be agreed more! My homework to the couples is to take a short walk at least for 10 min around the block whenever you feel out of control. It is so important to remind ourselves we are humans and we are not perfect. Getting angry, triggered, and misunderstood by everyone there specifically our partner is part of life. But how we choose to respond to our own triggers and emotions is the key to have a more blanched and more satisfying life. As a couple and relationship therapist I always emphasize the importance of pause, process and precede. Taking few minutes walk not only help out with physical health but also calm our nervous system down so was can come back with clarity and calm to our partner," writes a therapist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power walking is a faster-paced form of walking that offers enhanced health benefits compared to regular walking. By maintaining a speed of 4 to 5.5 mph, power walking boosts cardiovascular fitness, burns more calories, and strengthens muscles. It improves posture, engages the core, and enhances endurance without the impact of running. This low-impact exercise reduces the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and joint issues while promoting weight loss and mental well-being. Incorporating arm movements and proper posture maximizes its benefits. Power walking is an effective and accessible way to improve overall health and maintain an active lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does walking help boost health?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is one of the simplest yet most effective forms of exercise. It requires no special equipment, can be done anywhere, and offers numerous health benefits. Whether it’s a brisk morning walk or a relaxed evening stroll, walking consistently can greatly enhance physical and mental well-being. Studies have shown that regular walkers tend to live longer and healthier lives. Walking reduces the risk of chronic diseases, improves mobility, and enhances overall quality of life, making it a key factor in healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking strengthens the heart by improving circulation, reducing bad cholesterol (LDL), and increasing good cholesterol (HDL). Regular walking lowers the risk of heart diseases, high blood pressure, and stroke. Just 30 minutes a day can significantly improve heart health and boost overall endurance. For individuals with diabetes or those at risk, walking helps regulate blood sugar levels. A short walk after meals can enhance insulin sensitivity and reduce blood sugar spikes, making it an excellent habit for diabetes management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is an effective way to burn calories and maintain a healthy weight. A brisk 30-minute walk can burn between 150-200 calories, depending on body weight and speed. It also helps in improving metabolism, making it easier to manage weight without the stress of intense workouts. It engages various muscles, including the legs, core, and back. It helps maintain bone density, reducing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking, especially in nature, reduces stress, anxiety, and depression. It stimulates the release of endorphins, the body’s natural mood boosters. Walking in fresh air and green surroundings can also improve concentration, creativity, and overall mental clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking stimulates the immune system, helping the body fight infections. Studies suggest that people who walk regularly have a lower risk of colds, flu, and other illnesses. Walking enhances circulation, which allows immune cells to move more efficiently throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular walking can improve sleep quality by reducing stress and balancing circadian rhythms. It helps in managing insomnia and contributes to more restful and uninterrupted sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A post-meal walk aids digestion by enhancing gut motility and reducing bloating. Walking after meals can also help prevent acid reflux and promote overall gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 05:42:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_AFBVV95cUxPbTYyb29oRjRrMUotTVEyRjktcXhYcE4xaVIyaTNmOXdwTkxQR1Q2eXY5eTRLeXBTb3hjbVpDMXZ3emJPQ2FTMTJ3dVBKYmxGQklfRW1OcGxtOTg1RzI4eHEzV2V6NFdzbDNOUnRrTGJQX1VhRl9hMWZieEt4YmcySE8tZWY4R196TDE4UzdVYWxHdy1KdzFlSXFEWndYVE9rM05lYWQ0TW1UNFV5WnpSQXdkdjJ2dUJ0dm9ZSDBVNXQ0Q2Q0VEJiWEhNODctYkZyM2VudzJ2emdNQ0FSUDh4U1dJYm5yVkZSOXJ2X0JNUjJscEpBQW5tWEdHNl_SAYICQVVfeXFMTTRUVWZuNVpKNnJCckpXZkx3VjNYVGRBRVlKakp2QWlLdTZ1TEp3YVh1bUlTcTVidVpONlBOYWlrUzZzb3dKeEdFZ1FwUUs0VjJMS1ZPVGlCR1pOYm9jT2FGakhickFGeU9vLUVRYzBYTmx4ZXAxdEwyTDBJdHlTSGhZR3lRVXVZOEhYYUdmRGtCTDhnbmxLdkRfRTNaZGk2QUpCQmxUZ3NCQ0hxZ2Z0Q2VVTzh1eGpoVDFlN3hSQW1NQjZrWUJ5UWVKN2hJQnVPQ2lRWWduWUwzSUg4aWZVVFNVaWR2YXhGM0ZCYWc3bnl5TXZvX2J4RGpqN29tckR4cHNR</guid></item><item><title>Yale scientists link Covid vaccines to alarming new syndrome causing 'distinct biological changes’ - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 vaccines have been crucial in preventing millions of deaths during the pandemic. However, post-vaccination, a few reported some side effects such as fatigue, exercise intolerance, brain fog, tinnitus, and dizziness. A recent study by Yale researchers has delved deep into this little-understood, persistent condition, referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study posted online, the researchers have characterized this condition and also studied the immunological patterns that differentiate those with PVS from others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work is still in its early stages, and we need to validate these findings,” Akiko Iwasaki, Sterling Professor of Immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine (YSM) and co-senior author of the study published Feb. 19 as a preprint on &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.18.25322379v1" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;MedRxiv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; said in a release. “But this is giving us some hope that there may be something that we can use for diagnosis and treatment of PVS down the road.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chronic symptoms of PVS include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;exercise intolerance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;excessive fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;brain fog&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Insomnia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;dizziness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms develop shortly after vaccination, which is within a day or two, and can get more severe in the days that follow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s clear that some individuals are experiencing significant challenges after vaccination. Our responsibility as scientists and clinicians is to listen to their experiences, rigorously investigate the underlying causes, and seek ways to help,” Harlan Krumholz, the Harold H. Hines, Jr. Professor of Medicine (Cardiology) at YSM and co-senior author of the study adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed blood samples from people in their Listen to Immune, Symptom, and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN) study to understand long COVID and post-vaccine syndrome (PVS). They compared 42 people with PVS symptoms to 22 people without symptoms after COVID-19 vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found differences in immune cells between the two groups. Those with PVS had lower levels of effector CD4+ T cells and higher levels of TNF-alpha+ CD8 T cells — both are types of white blood cells — among other differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found differences in antibody levels. People with PVS who never had COVID-19 had lower levels of antibodies against the virus's spike protein. This was likely because they received fewer vaccine doses than those without PVS. With fewer shots and no prior infection, their immune systems had less chance to build protection against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, they found that some people with PVS had higher levels of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, even if they had never been infected. Normally, the spike protein stays in the body for only a few days after vaccination, but in some PVS cases, it was still present more than 700 days later. This lingering spike protein has also been linked to long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was surprising, to find spike protein in circulation at such a late time point. We don’t know if the level of spike protein is causing the chronic symptoms, because there were other participants with PVS who didn’t have any measurable spike protein. But it could be one mechanism underlying this syndrome,” Iwasaki noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krumholz further added that PVS might be similar to other infections that lead to chronic symptoms, each through different biological pathways. “One person might develop chronic symptoms due to immune dysregulation, while another experiences lingering effects from viral reactivation. We need to map these different pathways carefully to understand what is happening in each case. This work is just beginning, and further studies are essential to guide diagnosis and treatment,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Shakira's Health Crisis: Fans Rally Outside Hospital Following Her Statement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers added that a deeper understanding of PVS is required to make better &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/seeing-the-invisible/does-the-estimate-of-154-million-lives-saved-by-vaccines-since-1974-stack-up/" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, with fewer side effects. “For instance, if we can determine why spike protein is persisting for as long as it is in some people, maybe we can remove it — with monoclonal antibodies, for example — and maybe that could help reduce PVS symptoms,” Iwasaki adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re only just starting to make headway in understanding PVS. Every medical intervention carries some risk, and it’s important to acknowledge that adverse events can occur with vaccines. Our focus must remain on understanding what these people are experiencing through rigorous science and addressing the needs of those affected with compassion and an open mind,” Krumholz added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 05:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>USDA issues conditional license for bird flu vaccine amid ongoing crisis - 9News.com KUSA</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxPZ29IbU1aTjZka051anhVX3c5ajVFVnozQWlMOUw4RTJZeGxFMnNObjRCdWtDOXhPanVvRzNiR2w4dVpVR2J3VVE3Q3ZON0JSN2VFZjg3dFJBbWpnMmtUTTYzZVg2R2w3Q0VLMDI5bDhfMFhKMUx3QU56UG5rdFhRN1JfWVdBdWJMNm9DVVNSMlZFbkdTWlVNRi1YNmxZQjlJcDFmbC01dUNiWVJNN2JUcm0yWVQzLXZnbjhFT2syVWs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

The study has now sparked global concerns over a possible future pandemic.

The virus was first detected in the Japanese pipistrelle bat species in Hong Kong and has now been found to have the ability to bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors—the same receptors used by SARS-CoV-2 for infection. According to the study, which was published in the peer-reviewed journal Cell, the virus can also attach to ACE2 receptors in other mammalian species, increasing the possibility of cross-species transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is HKU5-CoV-2 similar to SARS-CoV-2?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery of HKU5-CoV-2 is concerning due to its similarities to SARS-CoV-2, as both viruses rely on ACE2 receptors to enter human cells. However, researchers highlight that HKU5-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 receptors far less efficiently than SARS-CoV-2, reducing the risk of widespread human transmission. Laboratory tests confirm that while HKU5-CoV-2 can infect human cells and lung tissues, its capacity to spread quickly among humans is significantly weaker than that of SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO READ: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#News#href" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/us-news-donald-trump-removes-iconic-145-year-old-resolute-desk-days-after-elon-musk-son-visited-oval-office-heres-why/articleshow/118447080.cms" data-type="tilCustomLink" target="_blank"&gt;Trump removes iconic 145-year old resolute desk days after Elon Musk, son visited Oval Office.

Researchers emphasize that the likelihood of HKU5-CoV-2 causing a human epidemic is lower than that of COVID-19. While the study recognizes that bat coronaviruses present a potential spillover risk, not all animal coronaviruses successfully transmit to humans.

While for others, hunger cues start as soon as the alarm goes off in the morning. Turns out, there’s a lot your body might be trying to tell you if you’re waking up hungry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hunger is the body’s way of signaling it needs fuel, but it can offer a few clues about other aspects of your health and lifestyle, too. How hungry you feel in the morning can be a matter of dehydration, over- or under-eating the night before, what you ate the night before and how well you slept — all things you can remedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s not better or worse to wake up hungry. Hunger is our body’s natural response to when blood sugar is low to stimulate you to eat and keep the blood sugar higher,” Dr. Deena Adimoolam, a specialist in endocrinology and obesity medicine, tells TODAY.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, if you find yourself ravenous in the mornings, nauseated or disrupted in the middle of the night because of hunger, there might be something more serious going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does it mean to wake up hungry?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People might worry when they wake up hungry because they think it means they didn’t eat enough the night before or that they’ll be prone to overeating at breakfast, but “waking hungry is perfectly normal,” says registered dietitian Natalie Rizzo, TODAY.com’s nutrition editor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This is especially true if the last meal you ate before bed was dinner, she adds. “For example, if you eat dinner at 6 p.m. and then go to bed at 10 p.m. and wake up at 6 a.m., you have fasted for 12 hours. Being hungry after a 12-hour fast is normal! And while there’s nothing wrong with eating after dinner, limiting food in the hours before bed leads to better sleep and less indigestion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What you eat is as big a factor as when you eat. “The type of food you eat at night definitely plays a role in how you feel the next morning,” says Rizzo. “If you eat a small meal that doesn’t have enough protein or fat, it won’t curb your appetite and can lead to extreme feelings of hunger that night or the next morning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Those hunger pangs first thing can also be the result of lack of sleep or a sign of dehydration, Dr. Reshmi Srinath, an endocrinologist for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, tells TODAY.com. Thirst is often mistaken for hunger, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you’re routinely waking up hungry which, again, isn’t necessarily a bad thing, here are some other possible reasons, according to the experts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You're taking a medication that increases appetite&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You had a bowel movement overnight or late at night&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You're exercising more than usual&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You consumed more alcohol than usual the night before&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does waking up hungry mean you have high cortisol?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There are no studies showing that hormonal causes are contributing to morning hunger,” says Srinath, but it's a widely spread belief. Cortisol, the body’s stress hormone, naturally spikes in the morning. Like other hormones, cortisol levels rise with the sun and fall throughout the day leading to a slump around 4 p.m. or 5 p.m. and then sleepiness at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While cortisol can impact day-to-day functioning if levels are especially high, Srinath says, there’s no correlation between the hormone and a.m. hunger.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does waking up hungry say about your metabolism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After a night of sleep, it might feel as if your last meal wasn’t all that long ago, but the hours you spend getting shuteye are enough to work up an appetite and break down the calories from the night before. If you’re waking up hungry, it’s likely not the result of a fast or high-functioning metabolism, the experts say, but a normal occurrence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When is waking up hungry a concern?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If waking up hungry is bothersome or especially distracting in the mornings, the experts suggest hydrating more, &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-times-to-eat-rcna58563" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:timing your dinner later;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;timing your dinner later&lt;/a&gt; and incorporating more fiber and protein into your diet so that you’re more satiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If morning hunger accompanies headaches, lightheadedness, dizziness, brain fog or sweat, Adimoolam suggests a 15-gram serving of “fast-acting sugar” to get your blood sugar levels up and hold you over until breakfast. Some options she suggests include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;1 tablespoon of sugar, honey or corn syrup&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;4–6 ounces of juice or regular soda&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Roughly 3–4 glucose tablets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Approximately 3 pieces of hard or gummy candies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Consider reaching out to a doctor, however, if you’re regularly hungry in the morning and your blood sugar falls below 70 mg/dL, says Adimoolam. Chronic low blood sugar can be associated with conditions including diabetes, kidney disease, malnutrition, adrenal insufficiency and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The same goes for hunger that disrupts your sleep. “If you wake up in the middle of the night and feel extreme hunger pangs in your stomach, there’s a good chance you aren’t eating enough,” adds Rizzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This may happen when someone is trying to lose weight, but extreme hunger is never good for anyone. It’s fine to wake up hungry and be excited about eating breakfast. But if you’re waking up at 3 or 4 a.m. and feel like you could eat a huge meal, you may want to look at your overall eating patterns,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This article was originally published on &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/health/waking-up-hungry-rcna192814" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TODAY.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;TODAY.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 05:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE9jM2NudkZRLTZaVWtaV2U4cVZCMjFISzRJYVlZN3RsZHlpeGE3bFUxcjQydnlFbkc4eTdBYklydHBmWWppQkwzcWlnSGF0RU5RRFZXWWZ3bndhek1ibGxVaU03X0RKU0ZMU3huc0dZZ1M2aFdfeXZISnhKb3U</guid></item><item><title>These Are The Most Dangerous Foods In Your Refrigerator, According To Foodborne Illness Experts - Yahoo Life</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQMkU1bEl0ZUZpWGxwNTNKTk4ydTRVUDA4czIyMTBDREFIRWdiT2ItcEhRRkQ1akphVlQ2ZFhaVk9xVXUzeGR3LTRUeXR2WE1MRDdUQ2phVEtlS1RLTFpFTEF4MlFZS3pLN2k0bkhZT1czblEtYlJ3WExOTUVOOWxDNnFzWWsxSlNxTE5ha0JPN3lGUTM4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;You open up your fridge all the time — out of hunger, boredom or simply a need to find something to cook for dinner. As great as it is to have food standing by whenever you need it, there are also dangers lurking in that chilly appliance. Is there bacteria brewing in three-day-old cooked rice? Or on the fresh salad greens? Or maybe that raw chicken that’s dripping everywhere?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person looking into a refrigerator at night, with various items inside the fridge, seeming contemplative about what to eat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We talked to experts about the foods that can pose the greatest danger to health. First, it’s important to understand your level of risk. “The truth is, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; food can potentially cause food poisoning,” said Dr. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjuliekendrick%2Fmost-dangerous-foods-in-refrigerator&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.treated.com%2Fclinical-team%2Fdr-daniel-atkinson&amp;amp;xcust=7834414%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daniel Atkinson;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Daniel Atkinson&lt;/a&gt;, clinical lead at Treated.com, an online health care service company. “Food that’s been left out too long, has been kept in the fridge past its use-by date or leftovers that aren’t reheated properly can all be contaminated with harmful bacteria.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be careful with high-protein foods, fresh vegetables and cooked rice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close-up of a plate of fried rice with vegetables, including peas and carrots, promoting a savory and colorful dish for a food article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are general categories of food that deserve extra care in their storage. If you’re looking for the most likely culprits, “Think of those high-protein foods that pathogens love, like meat, fish, milk, cheese and eggs,” said &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjuliekendrick%2Fmost-dangerous-foods-in-refrigerator&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fmatt-taylor-cp-fs-cenvh-fcieh-cert-iosh-76247b34%2F%3Ftrk%3Dorganization_guest_main-feed-card-text&amp;amp;xcust=7834414%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Matt Taylor;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Matt Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, senior manager of food consulting at the NSF, a nonprofit organization that develops and certifies standards for food safety and sanitation. His view was echoed by consulting food scientist &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjuliekendrick%2Fmost-dangerous-foods-in-refrigerator&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bryanquocle.com&amp;amp;xcust=7834414%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bryan Quoc Le;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Bryan Quoc Le&lt;/a&gt;, who pointed to other high-protein culprits like Mexican soft cheese, smoked fish and unpasteurized milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another concern is what’s called “ready to eat” meat or poultry, which includes deli meats sliced at the counter, said University of Connecticut associate professor &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjuliekendrick%2Fmost-dangerous-foods-in-refrigerator&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdamicolab.animalscience.cahnr.uconn.edu%2Four-team%2F&amp;amp;xcust=7834414%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dennis D’Amico,;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Dennis D’Amico,&lt;/a&gt; whose expertise includes food microbiology and safety. He also said that pathogens can contaminate fresh produce, including mushrooms, leafy green prepackaged salads and sprouts. “Most fresh produce should be washed and scrubbed with a produce brush at home,” he said. “Just remember to clean and sanitize the scrubbing brush.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another possible danger comes in cooked rice, which Atkinson explained: “Before it’s even cooked, rice can contain spores of a bacteria known as &lt;em&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/em&gt;,” he said&lt;em&gt;. “&lt;/em&gt;This bacteria can still pose a threat after rice has been cooked, and the risk of becoming ill from eating it is much higher if cooked rice isn’t handled the right way.” He warned that rice should never sit out on a countertop at room temperature. “Refrigerate rice as soon as it’s cooled down, and eat it within 24 hours. One misconception might be that rice that’s unsafe to eat will show visible signs of being off, such as being moldy or having an unusual smell. But this might not always be the case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And, he said, you need to be just as cautious with takeout rice, which might have even more potential to do harm. “Additives and spices in fast-food rice might mask signs that it needs discarding, and there’s no way of knowing how long it was stored before being cooked to order,” he said. “For this reason, you should probably avoid putting it in your refrigerator altogether and toss it out when the meal is over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sight and smell can’t always save you (nor can refrigeration).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person sniffing a carton from an open refrigerator, wrinkling their nose, possibly due to a questionable smell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you think you’ll be able to use your senses to uncover food dangers, that may not necessarily be the case, the experts said. “Don’t believe that if it smells good, it’s safe to eat,” said registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjuliekendrick%2Fmost-dangerous-foods-in-refrigerator&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.holyname.org%2Fnutrition%2Fstaff.aspx&amp;amp;xcust=7834414%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tracee Yablon Brenner;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Tracee Yablon Brenner&lt;/a&gt;. “Actually, a good deal of harmful bacteria, such as salmonella and listeria, don’t influence the smell, taste or appearance of food. Bacteria that’s spoiled might make some food smell terrible, but bacteria also can flourish unnoticed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As handy as refrigeration is, it’s not foolproof, said &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjuliekendrick%2Fmost-dangerous-foods-in-refrigerator&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wagnerreese.com%2Four-team%2F&amp;amp;xcust=7834414%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jason Reese;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Jason Reese&lt;/a&gt;, an attorney who specializes in foodborne illnesses and personal injury. “One of the biggest misconceptions I’ve seen is the belief that cold temperatures and refrigeration completely stop the growth of bacteria,” he said. “While it can slow growth, it doesn’t totally eliminate it, especially for dangerous pathogens, including listeria.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, keeping your fridge at the proper temperature is very important. “Higher refrigerator temperatures can facilitate pathogen growth, which increases the risk of illness and more serious complications,” D’Amico said. “The preferred refrigeration temperature is 2° to 4° Celsius (35.6° to 39.2° Fahrenheit), but studies have shown that average consumer refrigerator temperature is closer to 7° C (44.6° F).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lazy mistakes you should stop making.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person eating salad at a desk with a computer, pens, and smartphone nearby, suggesting a work-from-home lunch break&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you’re in the habit of tossing a half-eaten bowl or can of food directly into the fridge, you may want to rethink that, Le said. “Uncovered foods can easily incubate and spread microorganisms, as the air in the refrigerator is constantly moving and can transport spores around to other foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you’ve served a meal and are enjoying just sitting around the table afterward, don’t forget that food needs to be refrigerated quickly, said &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjuliekendrick%2Fmost-dangerous-foods-in-refrigerator&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstopfoodborneillness.org%2Fmedia-page%2F&amp;amp;xcust=7834414%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mitzi Baum;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Mitzi Baum&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of the nonprofit Stop Foodborne Illness. “Bacteria are always on the move and can grow in perishable foods like meat, eggs, salads, cut fruit and casseroles within as little as two hours,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And if you happen to hear something on the news about a food recall, don’t ignore it. “Take recalls seriously,” she added. “When a product is recalled, consumers should act quickly to remove it from their homes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give yourself permission to waste food.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person discarding a plate of chili with corn and beans into a trash bin lined with a plastic bag&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If you aren’t sure how long food has been in the fridge, throw it away,” Taylor said. But to prevent future food waste, he had this handy idea: “Keep a roll of painter’s tape and a permanent marker in your kitchen, so you can easily label items with names and dates when you store them. Always review food labels for expiration and ‘best by’ dates, as well as serving and safe storage directions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If you’re serious about avoiding getting sick from the food you eat, it always makes sense to make practical decisions,” Atkinson said. “The old adage ‘if in doubt, throw it out’ is a solid rule of thumb when it comes to food safety, and while it might feel wasteful at times to throw out food that’s suspect, you’ll feel better knowing you’re taking fewer risks.”&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjuliekendrick%2Fmost-dangerous-foods-in-refrigerator&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffpost.com%2Fentry%2Fmost-dangerous-foods-in-refrigerator_l_67ab657de4b0c52db9aac4c3&amp;amp;xcust=7834414%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost.;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 04:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQMkU1bEl0ZUZpWGxwNTNKTk4ydTRVUDA4czIyMTBDREFIRWdiT2ItcEhRRkQ1akphVlQ2ZFhaVk9xVXUzeGR3LTRUeXR2WE1MRDdUQ2phVEtlS1RLTFpFTEF4MlFZS3pLN2k0bkhZT1czblEtYlJ3WExOTUVOOWxDNnFzWWsxSlNxTE5ha0JPN3lGUTM4</guid></item><item><title>Dementia risk can be reduced with one simple habit experts say is most important you can do - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOSzJnbThucEhlQkpYS0pvRFNhX2c4MFhZNnZYZGZtS1d3QS1xUGJ0NGVtcDhkZHVjSHl1ODdtZldJYlo1RW92YWxVTnpwaHhBX1ZGRVhNdVhQdTRadTRISFhjSHFIcjNpaHo0REFFaTd0U192VXZVZjFfQWhURXZXcGdJVELSAYoBQVVfeXFMT0E1WGhUbkRPYXhxdmRFLTZlMEs3N0RfaXlaLTItT3Fza1NHX2l5NlU4bVYzd09vdXVxbzZzN0dQcC1oWXpTRi1VUFFHVnlrTnM2YV9FLTBtcUNJRWVheUFkT1VzZU9palVNRlBvUDRKanZXSHU2SG1nVW5qbHIzLU8tNmN0OERaS2J3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are nearly 1 million people in the UK with dementia, according to latest estimates, and that is expected to rise to 1.4 million by 2040. It mainly affects people over 65, though that's not to say it's impossible younger people won't also develop it. In fact, there have been many high profile cases recently of sports stars, especially rugby stars, developing the illness, thought to be because of repeated heavy blows to the head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But scientists do not believe that dementia is an inevitability of getting older, and there are things you can do to lower your risk of developing it. The two main things, broadly speaking, are exercise and a healthy diet. But before we get into that, let's look at what causes dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What causes dementia?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dementia is not a single disease and there are different diseases that can cause it. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia. Alzheimer's is thought to be caused by the abnormal build-up of 2 protein deposits which form "tangles" within brain cells, though scientists still do not fully understand this process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vascular dementia is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, which damages and eventually kills brain cells. This can happen as a result of a stroke, where the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly cut off, or lots of "mini strokes" that cause tiny but widespread damage to the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; There are also other kinds of dementia, including frontotemporal dementia, which is most often diagnosed between the ages of 45 and 65 and is caused by an abnormal clumping of proteins in the frontal and temporal lobes at the front and sides of the brain. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What increases chances of dementia?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; "Studies show an association between all types of dementia and sedentary behavior," Jigar Rathod MD, a neurologist at Memorial Hermann Mischer Neuroscience Associates, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-break-to-reduce-dementia-risk-11682107" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;told eatingwell.com&lt;/a&gt;, though he added that "a definitive correlating causal risk has not been determined". &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, it is known that sitting or doing little movement for a prolonged period of time uninterrupted can lead to decreased blood flow in the brain: "Sedentary behavior reduces blood flow to the brain, increases the risk of cardiovascular and related diseases (diabetes, hypertension, obesity), causes brain structure changes, and increases inflammation and insulin resistance," Verna R. Porter MD, a board-certified neurologist and director of Dementia, Alzheimer’s Disease and Neurocognitive Disorders at Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in California, told the same publication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How to reduce chances of dementia&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are risk factors to many illnesses, including dementia, that you can't do anything about, mainly age, family history and genetics. However, there are things you can do to lessen your chances of getting them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take breaks from sitting down&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If a sedentary lifestyle is one of the main factors for increasing your risk of developing dementia, then clearly one of the most important things you can do is try to be less sedentary. To put it another way, sit down less or take breaks from sitting down. This doesn't mean you have to go out and run long distances. Small amounts of walking, and even household chores and walking up and down the stairs, count. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"A sedentary lifestyle leads to decreased cerebral blood flow, increasing the risk of neurodegeneration. Physical activity, on the other hand, enhances circulation, which delivers oxygen and nutrients essential for brain health," said Dr Porter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exercise one part of the body in particular&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Dr Dean Sherzai, a neurologist and co-director of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Program at Loma Linda University in California, recently told the Zoe podcast that &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/one-exercise-slashes-risk-dementia-30908722" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;exercise was "tremendously important for the brain"&lt;/a&gt;. But he then focused on one particularly important part of the body to exercise: the legs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He said: "It seems that for a long period of time we thought that walking and running — which is phenomenal and walking is amazing, running is great if people want to do it — but building muscle specifically makes a huge difference. Because we have the largest groups of muscles in our legs below our belt,activating those muscles can create more of these growth hormones that Dean was talking about, specifically brain-derived neurotrophic factor. So doing things like squats and lunges, and sometimes we joke and say 'bigger legs, bigger brain'. That could be a title for a really nice book. But really focusing on our glutes and our hamstrings and our quads is incredibly healthy for the brain." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Improve your diet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Diet is also important, though scientists caution that the links between nutrients, dietary patterns, and dementia are still being researched. However, they believe that eating healthier diets reduces your risk. In particular, one diet, called the MIND diet, &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/one-diet-slashes-risk-dementia-30907191" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;has been said to reduce your risk of dementia by a staggering 53%&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MIND stands for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay. It combines two proven diets – the Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet – but focuses even more on foods known to boost brain health and reduce the risk of cognitive decline. This means a plant-focused diet particularly focused on green leafy vegetables, nuts, berries and whole grains, while limiting unhealthy foods such as red meats, butter, sweets and fried or fast foods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Play brain-stimulating games with other people&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Cognitive games, crossword puzzles, word searches and games on the computer/phone are helpful for reducing dementia risk. Board games are also of great benefit as they allow social interaction,” said Dr Rathod. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avoid smoking and reduce alcohol intake&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Smoking damages blood vessels, leading to reduced oxygen flow to the brain, while excessive alcohol accelerates cognitive decline and has neurotoxic properties,” said Dr Porter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOSzJnbThucEhlQkpYS0pvRFNhX2c4MFhZNnZYZGZtS1d3QS1xUGJ0NGVtcDhkZHVjSHl1ODdtZldJYlo1RW92YWxVTnpwaHhBX1ZGRVhNdVhQdTRadTRISFhjSHFIcjNpaHo0REFFaTd0U192VXZVZjFfQWhURXZXcGdJVELSAYoBQVVfeXFMT0E1WGhUbkRPYXhxdmRFLTZlMEs3N0RfaXlaLTItT3Fza1NHX2l5NlU4bVYzd09vdXVxbzZzN0dQcC1oWXpTRi1VUFFHVnlrTnM2YV9FLTBtcUNJRWVheUFkT1VzZU9palVNRlBvUDRKanZXSHU2SG1nVW5qbHIzLU8tNmN0OERaS2J3</guid></item><item><title>Ohio has reported its first pediatric flu death of the season.

"We urge parents to protect their kids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu activity typically peaks sometime between December and February, but ODH is reporting that current activity remains "very high." Hospitalizations this flu season have also been "well above" the five-year average for this time in the season, ODH said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Learn what doctors are telling parents below:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEnhancement" data-video-disable-history&gt;
    
        &lt;p class="VideoEnhancement-title"&gt;Ohio reports its first pediatric flu death of the season. What you should know&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
        
    
    
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the start of this flu season, Ohio has seen more than 9,000 flu-related hospitalizations. Hamilton County has had the second-highest number of hospitalizations in the state, with 539. Many of those have been children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you haven’t gotten your flu vaccine this year, get your flu vaccine," said Dr. Chris Peltier, a pediatrician at Pediatrics Associates of Mt. Carmel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peltier said one of the reasons we've seen more hospitalizations this flu season is due to the current strain: "(It's) more severe than ... other strains have been in past years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the most common reason for hospitalizations is the development of a second infection in the lungs, causing trouble breathing. But some complications are a bit rarer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Northern Kentucky family took their 5-year-old son Benjamin to Cincinnati Children's after he was unable to walk after testing positive for the flu. There, doctors diagnosed him with viral myositis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It essentially causes inflammation that causes some breakdown of the muscles … and unfortunately the only treatment for that is really sort of aggressive IV fluid, rehydration, and time," Peltier said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benjamin's family told us since getting his diagnosis, he is about 90% recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peltier said if anyone in the family gets sick, remember to stay hydrated. If you think you may need to go to the hospital, he recommends calling your primary care physician first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Over the following two days, the feeling spread up her legs and worsened when her skin was even lightly touched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ibuprofen didn’t help. A trip to the emergency room revealed no obvious culprit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/#/bundle/postmost?method=SURL&amp;amp;location=YAHOO&amp;amp;initiative=feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Five days after symptoms started, the burning kept spreading up her trunk and into her arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Doctors were baffled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It was the start of a medical mystery that’s the subject of a New England Journal of Medicine case study this month. In an 11-page paper published Feb. 12, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and the University of Washington detail how the woman sought help at three hospitals as her symptoms got worse before she was diagnosed with parasitic worms infesting her brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s just so unusual,” said Robert Cowie, a research professor at the University of Hawaii and an expert in the parasitic worm that infected the woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After a week of these symptoms, the woman made a second emergency room visit as the burning feeling and her headache got more painful. Her exam was “reportedly normal,” save for an elevated immune-cell count seen in her blood test. She was discharged with advice to follow up with her primary care physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But the next morning, she awoke confused. She started packing for a vacation that was nonexistent and could not be dissuaded by a family member. When the confusion continued for several hours, her partner brought her to Massachusetts General.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Doctors there documented that she had returned from a three-week trip to Thailand, Japan and Hawaii 12 days earlier. They noted that she ate street food in Bangkok - although none of it was uncooked - along with raw sushi in Tokyo and salad and sushi throughout her 10 days in Hawaii. She also swam in the ocean several times there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A spinal tap revealed she had extremely high levels of eosinophils, white blood cells that fight off parasites and other invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Doctors concluded she’d been infected with the parasitic worm &lt;i&gt;Angiostrongylus &lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;cantonensis, &lt;/i&gt;more commonly known as rat lungworm. Although rodents alone host the adult form of the parasite, their feces pass its larvae to snails and slugs, which can transmit the worm to humans. The larvae that infect people never mature enough to reproduce, but can survive long enough to wreak havoc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cowie, a rat lungworm expert who was not involved in the woman’s care, said doctors “took forever” to figure out what was ailing the patient, based on the case study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cowie said it’s the most recent example supporting his years-long rant about how “blissfully ignorant” most doctors are about the rat lungworm disease, or eosinophilic meningitis. That ignorance could result in harm to patients who need to take anti-worm medication quickly to avoid potentially life-changing or deadly consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Rat lungworms cause symptoms that range from nonexistent to headache, stiff neck, tingling or painful feelings in the skin, low-grade fever, nausea, and vomiting, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When rat lungworm illness was on the rise in Hawaii in 2017, one woman described her experience as akin to the pain of giving birth every day - maybe even worse. “That was like eating ice cream compared to this,” she told KHON at the time. “It was like someone stuck an ice pick in my collarbone, in my chest and in the back of my neck.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Occasionally, it can cause paralysis or death, as was the case in 2010 when a young Australian rugby player named Sam Ballard ate a slug on a dare from his friends. The parasite infested his brain, putting him into a coma for more than a year and leaving him paralyzed. He died in 2018 at the age of 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People have gotten infected by eating raw or undercooked snails or slugs, a common practice in some cultures, the CDC reported. Some children got sick by swallowing them “on a dare” while others were infected by eating snails or slugs that had been accidentally chopped up in raw produce, salads or vegetable juices. Scientists have also found rat lungworm infections in other animals, such as freshwater shrimp, crabs and frogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Human outbreaks of rat lungworm have involved a few people to hundreds, the CDC reported. In total, more than 2,800 cases have been reported in about 30 countries, although that figure dates back to research published in 2008. Cowie said he’s collaborating with a research partner in China who’s documented at least 7,000 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers have recorded about 220 cases in the United States, the vast majority of those in Hawaii, where the disease was first documented in 1959. In the continental United States, there have been a handful of cases, almost entirely in southeastern states such as Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cowie said he thinks the disease might have spread well beyond what scientists have documented. He said he’s working on a grant proposal to figure out how much the parasite has spread in slugs and snails in the southeast because of climate change and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It could be that the parasite is more widespread than we know,” he said, “simply because we haven’t looked enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related Content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2025/02/22/trump-research-nih-federal-register/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scientists warn of long-term damage as Trump’s orders slow research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Scientists warn of long-term damage as Trump’s orders slow research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2025/02/22/usps-history-ownership-trump-commerce-department/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Postal Service, older than the nation, is about more than mail;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Postal Service, older than the nation, is about more than mail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/20/palestinian-authority-security-forces-jenin/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:With Gaza rule at stake, Palestinian forces struggle to make their case;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;With Gaza rule at stake, Palestinian forces struggle to make their case &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 03:21:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1yakhNTDZNNkFmVHFCTWhZa0JpSDYwWGdvOHNoSTQxSS1OcFZ2ODNibldpUFBvNXQxazBxSlI1UElwRmNFeGJyRmlURVBqVUFVZ3kwN1Z2WFpXYXVub3FoSEU2QWFSZl9McW1uOG1qNm9kUk0</guid></item><item><title>Ohio teen dies after catching the flu; State's first pediatric influenza death - WFMJ</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxPSW01aU1RSjh3amh5SzZmZk5leWdSU0lIYkhBeU5XUkFYdm52T2I4NVVTeWpnZHc2eFJzandiYzgxakVaOThiNEhmYWpyeEozZ3dqaHlxM2JNX3g3WHd4ZXY5MW8yVld2ODd4NVJRVVRPdjVWRmpsclBvTnJScFBGZUxjRzhJWFk5NGxRLVFhaEw5S2lYODU3UkdTbGpfZlpUZGhjLVIwcDZPOFA2RDREMERR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="Article-paragraph" data-reactid="336"&gt;&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:424"&gt;"Sadly, this tragic death reminds us that influenza, though common, is a serious health threat," said ODH Director Bruce Vanderhoff.

Surprised? Well, it’s all about nourishing your skin from the inside. Koreans have the skin of their dreams due to their genetics to an extent, a little because of the new-age skincare they use, and lastly through the diet they consume. Put on your favorite Korean drama, and you’ll find everyone sipping a fermented drink or tea. Well, here are 6 types of Korean teas that are known to make you look younger, build immunity, and give you glass skin:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ginseng tea&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginseng tea, derived from ginseng root, stands as one of Korea's most valued beverages. A study in the Journal of Ginseng Research confirms its ability to combat fatigue and enhance mental clarity while functioning as an adaptogenic substance that helps the body manage stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Citron tea&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citron tea, also called Yuja-cha, combines the benefits of vitamin C with a distinctive citrus flavor. This tea proves especially effective against coughs, colds, and sore throats. A new study published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences highlights how traditional Korean teas like citron tea can enhance energy levels, strengthen the immune system, and provide essential vitamin C for a glass skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ginger tea&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger tea has demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory properties, and the inflammation-reversing benefits of it can enhance your skin, giving it a glass skin sheen, as documented in the International Journal of Preventive Medicine. The tea helps reduce body-wide inflammation which makes you look younger and supports immune system function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Omija tea&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omija tea is made from a berry that is high in antioxidants, which protect cells from free radical damage that slows down aging and promotes general health. Omija tea made from five-flavor berries offers sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and pungent notes with a quite addictive taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Green tea&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of green tea on skin health are immensely high. Green tea, known as Nokcha in Korea, contains powerful antioxidants that protect cells from free radical damage, as shown in research published in the Food Science and Human Wellness journal. Regular consumption may help prevent various chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Job’s tears tea&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tea is often enriched with other wholesome ingredients like roasted nuts, seeds, and sometimes even dried fruits, creating a satisfying and flavorful blend that is bound to give you a glass skin. Job's tears tea, or as the Koreans call it, Yulmu-cha, provides fiber, vitamins, and minerals that slow down signs of ageing and bolster immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These immunity-boosting Korean teas combine traditional ingredients with proven health benefits, offering a proactive approach to maintaining wellness through regular consumption.

or Alzheimer’s disease, leading researchers to think he had not inherited the &lt;em&gt;PSEN2&lt;/em&gt; gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When scientists found out Whitney had inherited the gene, he earned the title of “escapee” or “exceptional resilience mutation carrier” where something in his body was stopping the &lt;em&gt;PSEN2&lt;/em&gt; mutation from taking effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Via brain scans, Llibre-Guerra and his team observed that while Whitney had high levels of amyloid protein in his brain, he only had a localized concentration of the protein tau.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/what-happens-brain-alzheimers-disease" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tau build-up;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tau build-up&lt;/a&gt;

These findings can then be applied to the more common form, late- onset Alzheimer’s disease to help slow progression earlier on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this study has identified protective genetic variants to resist the development and progression of DIAD, more studies need to be done to understand the underlying mechanisms,” Dao added. “Specifically, how do these variants restrict pathological tau spread?

&lt;p&gt;There are countless reasons to desire a healthy gut. Achieving and maintaining a robust microbiome — the trillions of beneficial bacteria and the useful chemicals they’re producing — in the lower section of our gastrointestinal tracts can aid our bodies with everything from battling pathogens to bettering our mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how do we do it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I get people to do is, firstly, think about diversifying their plants and trying to get 30 different kinds of plants across the week,” &lt;a href="https://www.theguthealthdoctor.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7815631" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Megan Rossi&lt;/a&gt;, a Ph.D. holder and registered dietitian who is known in some circles as the “queen of gut health,” recently told us — Raj Punjabi and Noah Michelson, the co-hosts of &lt;a href="https://shows.acast.com/am-i-doing-it-wrong" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7815631" data-affiliate="true"&gt;HuffPost’s “Am I Doing It Wrong?”&lt;/a&gt; podcast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rossi said that those plants should come from what she calls “the super six”: whole grains, nuts and seeds, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and herbs and spices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we want this diverse range of bacteria in our gut, which has shown to have a diverse range of skills and kind of like superpowers, then we need to feed them that diverse range of fertilizers, otherwise they’ll die off — they won’t grow,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rossi, the founder of &lt;a href="https://www.theguthealthdoctor.com/clinic" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7815631" data-affiliate="true"&gt;The Gut Health Clinic&lt;/a&gt; in London, also gave us a tip for better gut health that’s useful no matter what you’re putting in your mouth: Chew your food more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It really just comes down to digestion,” she said. “Not only do we start to physically break down food in our mouths, but we have enzymes in our saliva that start to chemically break it down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that the more masticating we’re doing, the more nutrients we’re coaxing out of our food, which is good for our guts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130715134643.htm#:~:text=The%20study%20found%20with%20fewer,to%20go%2C%22%20Mattes%20said." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7815631" data-affiliate="true"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; looked at almonds, and they compared people who chewed the almonds 10 times versus 40 times,” Rossi told us.&lt;/p&gt;

The virus can be transmitted via droppings, urine, blood and saliva. The rats also provide a vessel for the virus to move between farms and houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear what agency initially identified and tested the rats — or why the rats were tested. A spokeswoman for Riverside County’s public health department said she was unable to provide a response to those questions, and directed them to the USDA. The USDA did not respond to questions Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the first rats identified as having the disease in the United States since 2021, when this latest version of the H5N1 virus made its debut in North America. Other mammal species that have since been infected include skunks, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-01-18/cat-deaths-bird-flu-prompts-pet-food-new-rules"&gt;domestic cats&lt;/a&gt;, bottlenose dolphins, harbor seals, foxes, mountain lions and coyotes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 50 species of North American mammals have been infected, including &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-02-13/cdc-study-h5n1-bird-flu-in-dairy-cows-more-widespread-than-thought"&gt;tens of thousands of dairy cows&lt;/a&gt; — with cases confirmed in at least 973 herds across 17 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery, disclosed Wednesday, comes at a time when the Trump administration is trying to rehire dozens of USDA bird flu scientists it had recently fired, based on cost-cutting recommendations from the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the USDA did not respond to inquiries from The Times about the rats or the fired employees, the agency said in a statement &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bird-flu-in-rats/" target="_blank"&gt;to CBS News&lt;/a&gt; that it was working “to swiftly rectify the situation,” and said it had exempted veterinarians and other emergency response personnel focused on bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency “continues to prioritize the response to highly pathogenic avian influenza,” it told the news agency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 22:54:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxNSDRyc1BtZjFfOGJUQnZaZkNzbkp3WXktZVVUWU44QWYxMnVUblUzUV9fQ3VsTG5Kb0Rrbm1pZy0td3FUT1BVMHk3OVI5S3NLbHc3NW1JU0QwV0kxdEpBYzFwTTNCOTMzOWEtWTNIVW1lWFVacUxaX1FobmRLWUY4dVE3a1hMempFSUw4MTVJMTdzZw</guid></item><item><title>Opinion | RFK Jr. Makes His First Anti-Vaccine Move - The Wall Street Journal</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxOOExQeXFzUDk4bEg2WFJneEhKTG53bGlmYXJ2aVpnODJNRld3cnNVUmhrQ190TEVfcmpERXlscGx2TGQ0Z3JQZE12ZURwY1k2V0pwSF9VcjRfdFNoNGFlLTdrekVqZW5RRFNyamZ6NElFTG9OZy1RN2VzeE8wNENpc1hpR3d3Z2pzQVUwazVFbWdHUmM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 22:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxOOExQeXFzUDk4bEg2WFJneEhKTG53bGlmYXJ2aVpnODJNRld3cnNVUmhrQ190TEVfcmpERXlscGx2TGQ0Z3JQZE12ZURwY1k2V0pwSF9VcjRfdFNoNGFlLTdrekVqZW5RRFNyamZ6NElFTG9OZy1RN2VzeE8wNENpc1hpR3d3Z2pzQVUwazVFbWdHUmM</guid></item><item><title>Dozens of dead birds recovered from banks of Shark River suspected of having bird flu - News 12 New Jersey</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxNLXAybnFPTk1qdUNjSEVRbjNnU1p4aUc2X1FMS1RkLW9Db3J2Z0RyXzBqNnNDWDZKUnVHWmtuUkRYZW9Wa29SSkpud1RkZ2Z4ZmpMa1BBZ3FET0gwVk5BZXJ6M0Rjcl9CeDE4OWYwQ3ZSRFRreHFJU3RMYkZsVVY5LXB3dXdKSUFCSzdGUDBvbUpXS3JOQ0dMaDM0d1BXTkRGU3BhYWJzYUVkMjRxR1pkVWUzNFA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div alignitems="normal" justifycontent="normal" direction="column" gap="1rem,1.25rem" flexwrap="nowrap" class="sc-fsYfdN hQgjIe sc-1348a9b4-0 lhdfiP"&gt;&lt;p class="block"&gt;Up to 100 dead geese, swans, and ducks have now been recovered along the banks of the Shark River in Monmouth County – all from suspected bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;“We started seeing the dead birds probably about a month ago, maybe a little bit longer,” said Ken O’Brien, who lives along the Shark River in Shark River Hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;“These poor swans are dying on the beach and convulsing and it’s horrible to see,” said Mary, another neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;For people like Mary and Ken, seeing these disturbing sights from their yards has become common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;“I’m concerned about children because they’re always down there and there’s a playground there. If the foxes drag the birds, there it’s not too healthy,” said Mary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Arlene Sciarappa is the secretary and acting treasurer of the Shark River Cleanup Coalition – a group dedicated to preserving the beauty of the tidal estuary.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="block"&gt;“Although it hasn’t officially been confirmed, it’s pointing toward the avian flu, and we want to make sure people should avoid contact with the birds, if at all possible,” she said. “They expect with the weather warming up they expect a lessening of the avian flu."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Dead birds haven’t just been seen in Neptune Township. The suspected bird flu is affecting the entire Shark River Basin from Neptune City to Belmar to Wall Township, where 55 dead birds were recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;More dead birds were seen in Ocean County along the banks of the Manasquan River in Point Pleasant Borough. The DEP says if you see birds acting strangely, give them a call. No human cases of bird flu have been reported in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Crews have since cleaned up all the dead birds along the Shark River from the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Officials say the first case of what's known as "highly pathogenic" bird flu has been found in a Union County live poultry market. The unnamed store is under quarantine and will be disinfected. The state says no infected poultry was sold to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;If you want to report a suspected bird flu case, call the DEP at &lt;b&gt;877-WARNDEP&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12 New Jersey</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 22:46:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxNLXAybnFPTk1qdUNjSEVRbjNnU1p4aUc2X1FMS1RkLW9Db3J2Z0RyXzBqNnNDWDZKUnVHWmtuUkRYZW9Wa29SSkpud1RkZ2Z4ZmpMa1BBZ3FET0gwVk5BZXJ6M0Rjcl9CeDE4OWYwQ3ZSRFRreHFJU3RMYkZsVVY5LXB3dXdKSUFCSzdGUDBvbUpXS3JOQ0dMaDM0d1BXTkRGU3BhYWJzYUVkMjRxR1pkVWUzNFA</guid></item><item><title>Bird flu discovered at poultry market in Union County - NorthJersey.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxQS3VPUTNmTHRrQWZ1V2Z6V0pXdGdJb3RTQ3BhVEJTOE4wRzB0OGNyMlNvTmpkcVV2YVNVUUlCblh6U0ZVUTAxZHF2U1lmSXVqYk0ySkl3NWlMS0lNVmhwUHBzV0F3Q0V2b1BSTmlQRG9FRkFmNXVPS2kxMzVQdFloZzFtU1Zna0ctbzIybkNYazFkX3pyTkdpbU4yMDZTYzJoMl9PQUVHRC1OT2E3YWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;a class="gnt_em gnt_em__fp gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/news/health/2025/02/19/dead-birds-found-in-monmouth-and-ocean-counties/79186976007/" data-t-l=":l|l|c|view gallery:inline promo" aria-label="View Gallery - Dead swan, ducks, geese and sea gulls spotted along Jersey Shore waters" data-g-r="nav_mo" data-g-tn="pgcss" data-g-mtn="pg79186976007" data-g-moh="hpgm" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false" data-c-id="79186976007"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_gl_i" src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/19/PAPP/79186207007-dsc-00173.JPG?crop=7007,3943,x0,y364&amp;amp;width=660&amp;amp;height=372&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" elementtiming="ar-lead-image" srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/19/PAPP/79186207007-dsc-00173.JPG?crop=7007,3943,x0,y364&amp;amp;width=1320&amp;amp;height=744&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" alt=""&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_gl_vg" data-c-tc="23"&gt;&lt;svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg__ca"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_camera"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_expand"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb" data-c-et="Dead swan, ducks, geese and sea gulls spotted along Jersey Shore waters" aria-label="The state DEP was contacted over bird flu fears after dead waterfowl were found along the Shark River."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul class="gnt_sh"&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_sh_li"&gt;No humans have been reported infected with the virus in NJ.

			&lt;p&gt;There's a window of time in our lives we've all passed through yet still know so little about: early gestation. Researchers have found a pair of genetic deletions associated with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="152965" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; that likely occur in that formative period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery comes from a team of researchers led by &lt;span&gt;Harvard Medical School &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;clinician-scientist &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eduardo Maury, who combed through genetic data from blood samples of nearly 25,000 people with or without schizophrenia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the two genetic alterations need further validation, the findings strengthen an emerging idea that the seeds of schizophrenia aren't always inherited, yet still may be acquired long before someone meets the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152956" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152956" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/blastocyst_image_642.jpg" alt="embryo as a blastocyst" class="wp-image-152956 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/blastocyst_image_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/blastocyst_image_642-428x415.jpg 428w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/blastocyst_image_642-600x582.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152956" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Schizophrenia might begin with changes that take place when we're little more than a bundle of cells. (Juan Gartner/Science Photo Library)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so, it opens the door to early prevention a fraction wider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia"&gt;Schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; is a serious neurological disorder arising from a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors, with events such as &lt;a href="https://library.neura.edu.au/category/schizophrenia/risk-factors/non-genetic/index.html"&gt;childhood trauma&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/people-with-schizophrenia-have-a-strange-telling-response-to-the-epstein-barr-virus"&gt;viral infections&lt;/a&gt; likely &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.686666"&gt;playing a role&lt;/a&gt;, amplifying someone's risk of experiencing its symptoms of delusional or disordered thinking later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It affects in &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schizophrenia"&gt;1 in 300 people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide, usually manifesting in early adulthood. Yet there is evidence to suggest the physiology responsible for schizophrenia originates either in early pregnancy or as a result of gestational complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, scientists studying bundles of lab-grown cells resembling tiny brains &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia-begins-in-brain-in-first-trimester-of-pregnancy"&gt;found evidence&lt;/a&gt; that disorganized brain cells dividing hurriedly and differentiating too early may give rise to schizophrenia. And in 2021, researchers pinpointed &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pregnancy-problems-and-placental-genes-further-reveal-chances-of-schizophrenia"&gt;specific genes in the placenta&lt;/a&gt; that are active during complicated pregnancies and associated with the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Maury and colleagues identified two genes, called NRXN1 and ABCB11, that appear to be associated with schizophrenia when copies of the genes go missing in utero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're looking at mutations that are not inherited from the parents," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/994215"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; Chris Walsh, senior author and geneticist at Boston Children's Hospital, at the time the research was published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In NRXN1 and ABCB11, the researchers found alterations called &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Copy-Number-Variation"&gt;copy number variations&lt;/a&gt;, a type of genetic error where copies of a gene or long stretches of DNA are duplicated or, in this case, deleted in one person compared to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On rare occasions, copy number variations can be inherited, contributing to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/mp2011154/"&gt;around 5 percent&lt;/a&gt; of schizophrenia cases. Those so-called germline mutations would show up in every cell of the body, since they were written into a person's genome before the fertilized egg undergoes its first division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research also suggests &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia-is-80-genetic-according-to-this-massive-study-on-twins"&gt;four out of five cases&lt;/a&gt; of schizophrenia can be traced back to genes inherited from the child's parents, with more recent studies adding to the list of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-new-schizophrenia-risk-genes-in-first-of-its-kind-study"&gt;known genetic links&lt;/a&gt;. Yet that still leaves roughly 20 percent of cases without an obvious basis in inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the two genes identified in this study, Maury and colleagues found partial deletions of NRXN1 in five cases of schizophrenia, and none in the unaffected individuals of their control cohort. This prevalence was much higher than in population-level databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NRXN1 helps brain cells transmit signals and it has been associated with schizophrenia before – when &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3725"&gt;those mutations are inherited&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When mutations aren't inherited but acquired during early development or later life, they are termed &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_mutation"&gt;somatic mutations&lt;/a&gt;. As these arise after embryonic cells have already begun separate journeys forming the different cells that will go on to create a full human, they will be passed onto the descendants of the cell with the mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152950" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152950" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/mosaic_diagram_642.jpg" alt="diagram of mosaic body" class="wp-image-152950 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/mosaic_diagram_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/mosaic_diagram_642-428x415.jpg 428w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/mosaic_diagram_642-600x582.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152950" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Genetic changes in some embryonic cells (sCNV) can be passed down to whole areas of tissue as we develop, giving rise to what's known as mosaicism. (Maury et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell Genetics&lt;/em&gt;, 2023)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So somatic mutations are found only in a fraction of body cells; for example brain and blood cells, but not sex cells. This is the kind of NRXN1 mutation Maury and colleagues found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second gene identified, ABCB11, is known to encode a liver protein but its link to schizophrenia is far less certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maury and colleagues found deletions within the ABCB11 gene in another five cases of schizophrenia, all of whom didn't respond to antipsychotic medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That one came out of nowhere for us," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/994215"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Maury of ABCB11. "There have been some studies associating mutations in this gene with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but it hasn't been strongly implicated in schizophrenia per se."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the researchers &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-genomics/fulltext/S2666-979X(23)00139-8"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt; that alterations in these two genes "may contribute a small but significant part of the genetic architecture of schizophrenia."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to figure out just how much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-genomics/fulltext/S2666-979X(23)00139-8"&gt;Cell Genomics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in July 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Image credits: Michelle Henderson.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years, the Mediterranean Diet has dominated conversations about healthy eating, and for good reason. The Mediterranean Diet, which emphasizes fresh vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, and healthy fats like olive oil, has been shown to have heart-protective, anti-inflammatory, and longevity-promoting benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But fewer people know about the Atlantic Diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Less famous but no less nutritious, this diet is deeply rooted in the coastal regions of Portugal and Spain — much like the Mediterranean diet. A new study compared the two diets, finding that the Atlantic Diet is just as good as the Mediterranean one. In fact, it may even be a bit healthier (and cheaper) in some regards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-the-atlantic-diet"&gt;What is the Atlantic Diet?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never heard of the Atlantic Diet, you’re not alone. While researchers have studied the Mediterranean Diet extensively, the Atlantic Diet is still emerging in scientific circles. Yet, this diet — rich in seafood, whole grains, and seasonal produce — is good for your heart health, metabolic function, and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The two diets are similar in many regards, emphasizing healthy fats, less meat, and fruits or vegetables as well as physical and social activity. The Atlantic Diet is more prevalent in northern Spain and Portugal, whereas the Mediterranean one is more prevalent in the south. But there are also significant differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic is all about fresh and seasonal foods, as well as hearty dishes. It has a particular focus on seafood, whole grains, legumes, and a bit more dairy products than the Mediterranean Diet. Fish, especially oily varieties like sardines and mackerel, play a central role, providing heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Vegetables such as cabbage, turnips, and onions, along with rye, maize, and potatoes, are staple ingredients, reflecting the region’s cooler climate and agricultural traditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike many modern diets, the Atlantic Diet maintains traditional cooking methods like boiling, grilling, baking, and stewing. Atlantic foods often include hearty soups. Dairy, including cheese, yogurt, and butter, is consumed moderately, while olive oil remains the primary fat source. Red wine, in small amounts, is also a customary part of meals, mirroring Mediterranean traditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, there are also differences. Whereas the Mediterranean Diet (MD) uses more wheat, the Atlantic relies more on rye and corn. Where MD favors more legumes, AD features more potatoes and cabbages. And where MD uses more citrus fruits like oranges and lemons, AD includes more apples, pears, and plums. Soups and stews are more important in AD than MD.&lt;/p&gt;

But the Atlantic Diet is probably just as good (or even better). Image via Unsplash.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How do the two diets compare in terms of health?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean Diet has been studied extensively and is linked to a lower risk of heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and even cognitive decline. But could the Atlantic Diet offer similar benefits?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The AD has been far less studied, but there is some research on it nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="file:///C:/Users/marea/Downloads/10.1515_opag-2022-0406.pdf"&gt;2010 study in Portugal&lt;/a&gt; examined the relationship between the Southern European Atlantic Diet (SEAD) and heart disease. Researchers found that adherence to the Atlantic Diet reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (heart attack) significantly, suggesting that this diet might be just as heart-friendly as the Mediterranean Diet. In fact, some heart markers were better for people who followed the Atlantic Diet than the Mediterranean Diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why? The Atlantic Diet emphasizes fatty fish rich in omega-3s, known to lower bad cholesterol, reduce inflammation, and improve blood vessel function. The high fiber intake from whole grains and legumes also helps regulate blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 2023 study also found that older adults who followed the Atlantic Diet had higher gray matter density in their brains, a marker for better cognitive health and reduced risk of dementia. Furthermore, fermented dairy, fiber-rich vegetables, and whole grains promote gut microbiome diversity, which is essential for digestion, immunity, and overall health. Some researchers &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8401068/"&gt;suggest that&lt;/a&gt; the Atlantic Diet &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2814624"&gt;might have an advantage&lt;/a&gt; over the Mediterranean Diet because it incorporates a wider variety of prebiotic and probiotic foods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why haven’t we heard more about the Atlantic Diet?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite its clear benefits, the Atlantic Diet remains relatively unknown. A part of this boils down to hype and trends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the Mediterranean Diet boasts glamorous, colorful dishes like Greek salads and Italian pasta, the Atlantic Diet is simpler and heartier, often consisting of soups, stews, and boiled fish. It’s less Instagram-worthy and less fancy, though very healthy and nutritious. The Mediterranean Diet was championed by multiple countries and recognized by UNESCO, while the Atlantic Diet has not been internationally promoted in the same way. Hopefully, that will start to change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, the Atlantic Diet has received far less scientific attention. There’s not been enough spotlight on the Atlantic diet because it’s similar to the Mediterranean one and it’s hard to find more people who adhere to it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean Diet will always be a gold standard, but it’s time to put the Atlantic Diet on the map. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As research continues to explore the benefits of the Atlantic Diet, one thing is clear: Portugal’s lesser-known super diet deserves a seat at the global table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other affected counties in Texas include Dawson (6 cases); Ector (1); Lubbock (1); Lynn (1); Terry (20); and Yoakum (4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Texas, the majority of the cases continue to be in children: 26 are in infants and young children ages 0 to 4, and 51 are between ages 5 and 17. All but five cases have been in unvaccinated people. Sixteen people (roughly 18 percent) have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In New Mexico, there have been no hospitalizations, and five of the nine cases are in adults. The other four cases were between the ages of 5 and 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given low vaccination rate in the area and the contagiousness of measles, health officials expect the outbreak to continue to grow. Measles is one of the most infectious viruses known; 90 percent of people who are unvaccinated and exposed will fall ill. The disease is marked by high fevers and a telltale rash and can cause severe complications in some, including younger children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, about 20 percent of people with measles are typically hospitalized. Five percent develop pneumonia, and up to 3 in 1,000 die of the infection. In rare cases, measles can cause a fatal disease of the central nervous system later in life called Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Measles also wipes out immune responses to other infections (a phenomenon known as immune amnesia), making people vulnerable to various illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

ACIP holds full-committee public meetings at least three times a year to review evidence on vaccines and vote on new recommendations. The February 26-28 meeting was to be the first under new HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is not required to accept the recommendations of ACIP advisers, the agency has traditionally adopted those recommendations and based adult and child immunization schedules on them, as have groups like the American Academy of Pediatricians. ACIP recommendations also play a role in determining which vaccines are covered by health insurers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Postponing a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices delays vital discussions and needed decisions on a variety of vaccines by trusted and well-vetted experts," Infectious Diseases Society of America President Tina Tan, MD, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2025/statement-on-acip-meeting-postponement-and-removal-of-vaccine-information/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "ACIP relies on a well-established, transparent and evidence-based process for evaluating the optimal use of vaccines that plays a critical role in strengthening public health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The postponement is adding to fears that Kennedy, a longtime critic of vaccines who in the past has accused ACIP members of conflict of interest, could make changes to the group. Voting members of ACIP are appointed by the HHS secretary and serve overlapping terms of up to 4 years. Reporting by &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223"&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt; indicates that ACIP is among the advisory committees that Kennedy is targeting for changes, and there has been concern that he may appoint people with anti-vaccine views to the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HHS has not yet said when the ACIP meeting will be rescheduled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Changes of CDC vaccine promotional campaigns&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, changes to the CDC's promotional campaigns for various vaccines could be forthcoming. Earlier this week, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated"&gt;National Public Radio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; reported that the agency was stopping its "wild to mild" flu vaccination campaign, which was launched in September 2023. The idea behind the campaign was to promote how well flu vaccines work at preventing serious outcomes, like emergency department visits and hospitalizations, even if they don't always prevent infection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/"&gt;Stat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; reported yesterday that the campaign was one of several to be pulled, and that CDC officials were told that Kennedy wants future vaccine campaigns to promote the idea of "informed consent" in vaccine decision-making. Informed consent is an ethical and legal requirement that aims to ensure patients understand the risks and benefits of medical treatments before agreeing to those treatments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tan said that pulling promotional campaigns for vaccines "leaves Americans with fewer tools to make critical decisions in consultation with their doctors to protect themselves and their families." She called on Congress to hold Kennedy accountable for actions that could undermine vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Weakening our nation's vaccine infrastructure will lead to significantly lower immunization rates and result in many more outbreaks of serious, preventable hospitalizations and deaths," she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;HHS did not respond to a request to confirm the status of the CDC's vaccine promotion campaigns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Long-COVID advisory committee terminated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In other news, an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/commencing-the-reduction-of-the-federal-bureaucracy/"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; issued this week by the Trump administration calls for the termination of the HHS Secretary's Advisory Committee on Long COVID, a group that included long-COVID scientists and experts from several universities. The committee, which was established in November 2023, was still recruiting members and had yet to hold a meeting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The order also terminated the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Health Equity Advisory Committee. Also created under the Biden administration, the committee aimed to address structural racism and systemic barriers in CMS programs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The two were among several federal advisory committees and programs axed under the order, which seeks to reduce "elements of the Federal bureaucracy that the President has determined are unnecessary."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The researchers’ findings may support continued studies, leading to a potential, novel treatment to help manage ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;div class=" figure"&gt;&lt;div id="image-caption" class="text-gray-500 italic"&gt;&lt;div class="blockText_blockContent__TbCXh"&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Amlodipine tablets | Image Credit: © Ming - stock.adobe.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition that begins in childhood and persists throughout life, affecting a person’s ability to navigate daily responsibilities, including academic and professional tasks. It manifests differently among individuals, with symptoms generally falling into 3 categories: hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention. The intensity and visibility of symptoms can also fluctuate based on environmental factors and situational demands.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Traditional treatment for ADHD includes stimulants such as methylphenidate (Ritalin; Novartis), which have demonstrated significant success in real-world treatment of patients, as well as non-stimulants like viloxazine (Qelbree; Supernus Pharmaceuticals Inc). Patients may also utilize behavioral therapy or executive function coaching, as well as integrating healthy lifestyle habits. However, there is always a need for innovation and alternative options that offer patients more agency and options when receiving treatment for ADHD. Additionally, stimulants do have adverse effects such as appetite loss, high blood pressure, headaches, and sleep disturbance, as well as a potential for misuse.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1,2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;In a study published in &lt;em&gt;Neuropsychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt;, researchers explored the potential of amlodipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, as a foundation for novel ADHD therapies. Of the 5 drugs they tested, only amlodipine significantly reduced hyperactivity.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;2,3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;To assess its effects, researchers tested amlodipine in zebrafish, a widely used model for studying brain function due to their genetic similarity to humans, sharing about 70% of genes. The results showed that amlodipine reduced both hyperactivity and impulsivity—2 core symptoms of ADHD. Further analysis confirmed that amlodipine crosses the blood-brain barrier, allowing it to directly influence brain function.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;2,3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;The team then turned to human genetic data and found a striking link between ADHD and the same calcium channels targeted by amlodipine (α1-C; CACNA1C, β1; CACNB1, α2δ3; CACNA2D3), suggesting a relevant pathway for treatment. Additionally, a UK-wide patient data analysis revealed that individuals taking amlodipine reported fewer mood swings and reduced risk-taking behavior, further supporting its potential therapeutic benefits. Given its tolerability, cross-species efficacy, and strong genetic evidence, amlodipine presents a promising avenue for developing novel ADHD treatments.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;2,3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;"Repurposing amlodipine, a well-established blood pressure medication, offers a promising and swift pathway to address ADHD symptoms,” Matthew Parker, MD, co-author of the study from the University of Surrey, said in a news release. “Our research indicates that, due to its existing approval and safety profile, amlodipine could be rapidly redeployed as a treatment option for ADHD, potentially providing relief to patients sooner than developing new medications."&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h6 class="text-sm pb-4 pt-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REFERENCES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;h6 class="text-sm pb-4 pt-2"&gt;2.

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6s00063b5v1xkjtxjf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I remember being a new nurse in the ER, and even though I had all of the head knowledge of what to do in emergencies, when that patient rolled in from EMS … I found myself having a hard time catching my breath,” said Lorenzini, who is also the host of the nursing education podcast &lt;a href="https://www.rapidresponseandrescue.com" target="_blank"&gt;Rapid Response RN&lt;/a&gt;. “And if you can’t get your body to work, to do the things that you know how to do, then you can’t help the patient.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6s00073b5vcmowo9no@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s common for the body’s natural “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/04/health/stress-health-connection-wellness/index.html"&gt;fight-or-flight&lt;/a&gt;” response to kick in, and it may be hard to react the way you would otherwise like to under pressure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6s00083b5vevnvqmia@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But you can train the mind and body so that when the next high-stress situation arises, you are better prepared. Here’s how to keep your cool no matter what happens, according to Lorenzini and other experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t00093b5vvaimrare@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When Lorenzini was 9 years old, she went snorkeling with her family in Florida. At the time, she didn’t have the upper body strength to hoist herself up from the water, so she would need help getting back on the boat any time she left.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000a3b5vr0m6df7z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But when she encountered a barracuda in the water, she became so scared that the adrenaline her body produced gave her the strength to swim faster than she ever had and jump in the boat on her own.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000b3b5vp2gxxjwk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lorenzini noted that if she hadn’t known how to swim well or hadn’t practiced attempting to get back in the boat on her own, she would not have been as prepared for her quick escape from the predatory fish. “I would have just still floundered in the water, not knowing what to do,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000c3b5vu97kuthq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her experience shows how being prepared ahead of time can help in high-stress situations, such as completing a nursing program, practicing a speech in front of a mirror or studying for a big test.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000d3b5voeknib1t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But there are also ways to build up what’s called your nervous system resilience, the ability to keep the body’s stress response in a healthy balance, ahead of such stressful situations, said Dr. Inna Khazan, a lecturer on psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a clinical psychologist specializing in health psychology and performance excellence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000e3b5vq7i81a8b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One technique she often advises is to exercise the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21773-heart-rate-variability-hrv" target="_blank"&gt;heart rate variability&lt;/a&gt;, or HRV, which is the way in which a person’s heart rate goes up and down and constantly varies. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21773-heart-rate-variability-hrv" target="_blank"&gt;Having a higher HRV&lt;/a&gt; is a sign that your nervous system is healthy and that your heart can adapt better to daily challenges and stressors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000f3b5vdjym6tzf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By working on &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8924557/" target="_blank"&gt;resonance frequency breathing&lt;/a&gt;, a slow diaphragmatic breathing that is usually three to seven breaths per minute and synchronizes with your heart rate, the HRV will increase, which will train the heart to recover from stressors more quickly, Khazan said. People with higher HRVs tend to find it is easier to make decisions, focus and respond in challenging situations, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000g3b5vqzqztv0h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By checking in throughout the day concerning smaller stressors, a person can be more in tune with the way their body responds under high stress, said Julie Uhernik, a licensed professional counselor and registered nurse in Parker, Colorado.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000h3b5v0nmcxudm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Keeping a physical or mental note of how much stress you feel on a scale of 1 to 10 throughout the day can help you identify not only your stressors but also the natural symptoms of stress that occur, she added, and doing so can help you better react in those high-stress situations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000i3b5vdt3prn1d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Basic needs such as eating a healthy diet and getting enough sleep at night are crucial as well for improving your response to high stressors, Khazan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000j3b5vtm438hzg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When a person starts to feel the sensations of stress, thoughts such as “I can’t do this” or panic begin to happen, Lorenzini said. But when you’re mindful that these reactions, such as a change in breath or heartbeat, are normal, then you can use that awareness to your advantage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000k3b5ve0ml4uay@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I call it super nurse, or super Sarah, where I can function at my best,” she added. “With time, I kind of retrained myself to say, ‘Oh, these things that I’m feeling in my body, these are not hindering me. These are actually making me a better clinician, a better nurse.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000l3b5vg4v7so0z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Reminding yourself to take slower breaths is also important, Khazan said. She recommends breathing in normally through the nose for four seconds and breathing out — as if you are gently blowing out a candle — for six seconds to help rebalance the system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000m3b5vft6m5cxj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The goal is not to relax but rather “a self-regulation practice, so it can help the body get to that optimal level of activation,” Khazan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000n3b5vluka7xgh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Using your senses, such as taking note of the feeling of your feet on the ground or looking around to assess the situation and the reactions of others, can help you pause and think before reacting, said Uhernik, who is also a disaster mental health responder for the American Red Cross and a consultant in emergency preparedness for mental health professionals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000o3b5vhpbbhu8f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ultimately, it is important to remember that stress is inevitable, especially when emergencies happen, Uhernik said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000p3b5v3lqhbw5y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A little bit of stress is good for us. It keeps our nervous systems primed to respond when we need to, and to go back to a state of calm when things are OK and there’s no threat in the environment,” Uhernik said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

The five-year average for this week in the flu season is under 500 flu-related hospitalizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="2"&gt;“We’re still in the midst of flu season, and unfortunately this latest news reminds us that flu can be serious and people should not take the possibility of getting the flu lightly,” said Dan Suffoletto, public information manager for Public Health-Dayton and Montgomery County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="4"&gt;In Montgomery County, there have been a total of 620 flu hospitalizations, accounting for 6.8% of all the flu hospitalizations in the state. This is also a rate of 5.27 flu-related hospitalizations per 100,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="5"&gt;In Butler County, there have been 193 total flu hospitalizations, accounting for 2.1% of all flu hospitalizations in the state, according to ODH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-subscription__placeholder subscription-promo b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="7"&gt;In Clark County, there have been 168 total flu hospitalizations, accounting for 1.8% of all flu hospitalizations. Greene County has seen 153 flu-related hospitalizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-nativo_placeholder--moap b-clear-both is-deferred"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="9"&gt;Flu activity usually peaks between December and February. In Ohio, flu activity has been increasing since early December and has increased more rapidly since the beginning of the year. Current activity is very high, ODH says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="10"&gt;Since the start of the season, more than 9,000 flu-related hospitalizations have been reported in Ohio, according to ODH. Influenza A is the predominant type of the flu being seen in the state, and it &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/flu-a-vs-flu-b" target="_blank"&gt;causes more severe illness &lt;/a&gt;than type B flu, the Cleveland Clinic says. Flu A accounted for 96% of flu cases reported in late 2024, according to the Cleveland Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="11"&gt;The current number of flu-related hospitalizations is well above the five-year average for this time in the season, ODH says. The state’s five-year average omits years from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 flu seasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="12"&gt;There were 9,134 total flu-related hospitalizations by the end of the 2022-2023 flu season, according to ODH, which is in mid-May. The end of the 2023-2024 season had 10,236 hospitalizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="14"&gt;Ohio generally reports between one and six influenza-associated pediatric deaths each season. During the last flu season, five pediatric deaths occurred, down from six reported in the 2022-2023 season, according to ODH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="is-deferred MP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="is-deferred RP09 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="17"&gt;It’s not too late for parents and kids to get a flu vaccine, Vanderhoff said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="18"&gt;“It may very well prevent you or your loved ones from getting seriously ill,” Vanderhoff said. “And, especially during flu season, it’s important to maintain good hand hygiene and to stay home if you are sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="19"&gt;Flu vaccines are available at most health care providers’ offices, local health departments and retail pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="20"&gt;Other effective ways to avoid getting or spreading the flu include washing hands frequently or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer, covering coughs and sneezes with tissues or coughing or sneezing into elbows, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="21"&gt;“Staying home from when you’re sick and staying away from others is critical to helping stop the spread of the flu,” Suffoletto said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text text-center" data-index="24"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Dayton Daily News</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 21:45:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxOR05hWEdsb0xGWjVpNm1zdk9NQy1jbmU2dGpLR29UMVVWei1XSTFGUjI2UlJqV3dlTjhZUTZQSjBHM0FacW9VVkVSdnFyZF81MzhKTDdRMGRTQkhGdU05NC1mMHh4UjJIOW42ekpGWkxqdFE3SDhsTmRFdGpXMmttcnlMYzVBeDYxZGZvdWZWNUdQWnVPSlRxbERhVFE1allJZlA1eG1HOXZvTTI1SmgzajhsUURaQ1kxMm0zWWtVVXVIOFBZc3pBcEtpS0RTaUN5SXRWUXVKNk43TGhNZkFZWWtn</guid></item><item><title>Are you protected?

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON D.C., DC — As &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-texas/285-e97815dc-93d3-4943-b605-23d14e30d2ce"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; continues to spread across Texas, there are things you should know about the condition. Below are questions and answers from the Centers for Disease Control as well as a lot of bullet points about vaccination, including how to find your vaccination records if you’re not sure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is only some of the information from the CDC. You can find a lot more on &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;their page about measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Am I protected against measles?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, you are protected if you have records showing at least one of the following.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You received two doses of measles-containing vaccine and you are either a K through 12 child or an adult who is in a setting that could pose a high risk for transmission. That includes being a post-high school student, someone in healthcare or someone who travels internationally&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You received one dose of measles-containing vaccine and are either a preschool-age child or an adult in a high-risk setting for transmission&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lab confirmed you had measles at some point in your life&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lab confirmed you are immune to measles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You were born before 1957&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are an international traveler, the CDC considers you protected if you have records of at least one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You received one dose of measles-containing vaccine and you’re between 6 and 11 months old&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You received two doses of measles-containing vaccine and you’re 12 months or older&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lab confirmed you had measles at some point in your life&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lab confirmed you’re immune to measles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You were born before 1957&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do I need a booster?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. The CDC considers people who received two doses of measles as a child protected for life. If you’re not sure, check with your healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you only received one dose of measles vaccine as a child?&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, if you were born after 1957, one dose is considered sufficient to be considered protected from measles. Some adults may need a second dose. The CDC says adults who are going to be in high-risk settings for transmission should make sure they’ve had two doses at least 28 days apart.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those high-risk adults, according to the CDC, are:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students at post-high school education institutions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare personnel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;International travelers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who public health authorities determine are at increased risk during an outbreak.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Signs and symptoms of measles&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, symptoms usually begin seven to 14 days after infection. They can be dangerous, especially to babies and young children. You should contact your health provider immediately if you think you or a family member has been infected.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (may spike to more than 104°)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC says two to three days after symptoms begin, you may notice two white spots (Koplik spots) inside the mouth. Three to five days after symptoms appear, a measles rash may appear. It usually starts as flat red spots that appear on the face and hairline and spread downward to the neck, arms, legs and feet. Small raised bumps may also appear on top of the flat red spots. Spots may become joined together as they spread.  The rash could come with a fever spiking up to 104 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who is most at risk?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children younger than 5 years of age&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adults older than 20 years of age&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pregnant women&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with weakened immune systems, such as from leukemia or HIV infection&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is measles deadly? What are the complications?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, around one in five unvaccinated people in the U.S. who get measles are hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One in 20 children with measles gets pneumonia. One child in every 1,000 who gets measles will develop encephalitis, which is swelling of the brain. That could leave a child becoming deaf or with intellectual disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly one to three of every 1,000 children who get measles will die from respiratory or neurological complications.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For pregnant women who have not had the MMR vaccine, measles could cause premature birth or a baby with a low birth weight.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is extremely rare, according to the CDC, but can be deadly. It is a condition that results from a measles infection that happened earlier in life. It could show up seven to 10 years after a person has measles, even if the person fully recovered. The risk may be higher for people who had measles before the age of 2.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can I get measles twice?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Minnesota Dept. of Health and New York City government, you cannot get measles if you've already had it.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tgnaNewNode"&gt;What are the vaccines for measles?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The available vaccine is MMR, which contains a combination of measles, mumps and rubella vaccines. Two vaccines are available for use in the U.S.: MMR II and PRIORIX. The CDC says they’re considered interchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the MMRV vaccine, which contains a combination of measles, mumps, rubella and varicella – or chickenpox – vaccines. It’s only for use in kids 12 months old through 12 years old.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find a whole lot more about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" id="isPasted"&gt;vaccines on the CDC website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How can I tell if I've been vaccinated against measles?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there's no national online database, there are some things you can do to track down your vaccination records. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-adults/recommended-vaccines/keeping-vaccine-records-up-to-date.html"&gt;Here's a page from the CDC on how you can do that&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

This newly identified mechanism is independent of external stimuli and could influence vision by alternating between detail enhancement and object detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiments involving over 200 participants confirmed the effect across various conditions, including different breathing rates, lighting, and visual tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests the brainstem may control this process, as the function remains intact in individuals without an olfactory bulb. Since pupil size impacts visual clarity, this discovery may help explain how breathing influences attention and perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pupil-Breathing Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Pupil size is smallest during inhalation and largest during exhalation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vision Optimization:&lt;/strong&gt; Breathing may naturally switch vision between detail focus and object detection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could inform new diagnostic tools for neurological disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Karolinska Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden have discovered a fundamental mechanism that affects the size of the pupil, namely our breathing. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Physiology&lt;/em&gt;, shows that the pupil is smallest during inhalation and largest during exhalation – something that could affect our vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107906"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an eye." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Previous research shows that smaller pupils make it easier to see details, while larger pupils help us find hard-to-see objects. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the aperture in a camera, the pupil controls how much light reaches the eye. It is therefore fundamental to our vision and how we perceive our surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three mechanisms that can change the size of the pupil have been known for over a century: the amount of light, focus distance and cognitive factors such as emotion or mental effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now scientists have discovered a fourth: breathing. The pupil is smallest around inhalation onset and largest during exhalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This mechanism is unique in that it is cyclical, ever-present and requires no external stimulus,” explains Artin Arshamian, associate professor at the Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since breathing affects brain activity and cognitive functions, the discovery may contribute to a better understanding of how our vision and attention are regulated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted five experiments with over 200 participants, examining how breathing affects pupil size under different conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the effect persisted whether participants breathed quickly or slowly, through their nose or mouth, if lighting conditions or fixation distance varied, if they were resting or performing visual tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference in pupil size between inhalation and exhalation was large enough to theoretically affect vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that the function is intact in people born without the olfactory bulb, a brain structure that is activated by nasal breathing. This suggests that the mechanism is controlled by the brainstem, a fundamental and evolutionarily conserved part of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now investigating whether changes in pupil size during breathing also affect vision. Previous research shows that smaller pupils make it easier to see details, while larger pupils help us find hard-to-see objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that our vision may switch between optimising for distinguishing small details when we inhale and detecting faint objects when we exhale, all within a single breathing cycle,” says Martin Schaefer, a postdoctoral researcher at the same department at Karolinska Institutet and the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may also be clinical applications, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One potential application is new methods to diagnose or treat neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, where damage to pupil function is an early sign of the disease,” says Artin Arshamian. “This is something we want to explore in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was funded by the Swedish Research Council and the European Research Council (ERC). There are no reported conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this visual neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b7c7c5d2c4c4ded9d1d8f7dcde99c4d2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Press Office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ki.se" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Karolinska Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Press Office – Karolinska Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1113/JP287205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Pupillary Respiratory-Phase Response: Pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest during exhalation&lt;/a&gt;” by Artin Arshamian et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Physiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pupillary Respiratory-Phase Response: Pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest during exhalation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respiration shapes brain activity and synchronizes sensory and exploratory motor actions, with some evidence suggesting that it also affects pupil size. However, evidence for a coupling between respiration and pupil size remains scarce and inconclusive, hindered by small sample sizes and limited controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the importance of pupil size in visual perception and as a reflection of brain state, understanding its relationship with respiration is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In five experiments using a pre-registered protocol, we systematically investigated how respiratory phase affects pupil size across different conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Experiment 1 (&lt;em&gt;n = &lt;/em&gt;50), we examined nasal and oral breathing at rest under dim lighting with nearby fixation points, then replicated these results under identical conditions in Experiment 2 (&lt;em&gt;n = &lt;/em&gt;53).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiment 3 (&lt;em&gt;n = &lt;/em&gt;112) extended this to active visual tasks, while Experiment 4 (&lt;em&gt;n =&lt;/em&gt; 57) extended this to controlled breathing at different paces under ambient lighting with distant fixation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, in Experiment 5 (&lt;em&gt;n =&lt;/em&gt; 34), individuals with isolated congenital anosmia (born without olfactory bulbs) were used as a lesion-type model during visual–auditory tasks to assess whether the respiratory–pupil link depends on olfactory bulb-driven oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all conditions – free and controlled breathing; different tasks, lighting and fixation distances; and with and without olfactory bulbs – we consistently found that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest during exhalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We term this effect the pupillary respiratory-phase response, the fourth known mechanism influencing pupil size, alongside the pupillary light, near fixation and psychosensory responses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 21:24:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5Dak9uWlRLbGFwSzdCdVZESVRZaHRXNXAydi1Oc243RHQtT2E3ajlOcWJnY0pqOHRVOGRKOWJtV0ViNDlCM05RNGxDWWsxNDAtaS0zVm5QcmFTck00SmlZR1lweFd4ZVNRY0pHcDY4MUc</guid></item><item><title>Neenah family with 4-year-old who needs kidney transplant seek support amid nursing shortage - Post-Crescent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1wFBVV95cUxQVXhzazZneDdMekh2ODJIMTFqVmxyMzVuNUVyalJCMnB2dDZ5THBkMWdYQzVlNUtfa1RpTHVQVkp2eEZ1Z0FZbkllVGxOZTcydE9HanFncnl6Qk1OZldVVThnYkVtUmJlZlp2QTdMNDVvSk9aMVk2S1JXc2o4WHNKSnEzaUlwa3lkdVJaWjhkTlZFeW5mMGlqVHFyaTBnRk81Q3lhbjZ0QWxneW1GcE5jS0dkdWEwVWlWNGNHRUpYU01KaXhtbE95cHJYb3k1NUk5ZV9Lb2RWVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;ul class="gnt_sh"&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_sh_li"&gt;Mark and Mindi Piasecki, a Neenah family with five children, are seeking community support through a GoFundMe as they face medical challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_sh_li"&gt;The couple's 4-year-old son, Isaac, is on the waiting list for a kidney transplant, while their 1-year-old son, Levon, has a high level of nursing care needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/19/PAPN/79225758007-piasecki-family-2.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" elementtiming="ar-lead-image" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" alt="Mark and Mindi Piasecki have five adopted children: Tess, Adam, Quinn, Isaac and Levon.

As of Friday, it's at just under $3,000 of its $5,500 goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For the Piaseckis, the financial assistance is just one path to support for a larger issue — they need nursing help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Currently, the family has part-time respite support from a family friend and help from a registered nurse for two nights a week, but they qualify for more state-funded help — including 20 hours of private duty nursing daily for Levon's care. The problem is finding a qualified nurse to take on that job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Mark works nights, while Mindi cares for the children full-time. If Isaac receives a new kidney, Mark plans to take an unpaid leave from work under the federal &lt;a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Family and Medical Leave Act&lt;/a&gt;, for at least a month before, during and after the transplant, Mindi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Mindi said the family is not sure what they will do if Isaac needs to go on dialysis, since they will be in need of even more overnight nursing care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We're scared to death that we're going to lose everything. If (Mark) has to take a couple months off from work, we'll have no paycheck. We'll have no insurance. We'll have to pay for (healthcare) out of pocket," Mindi Piasecki said.

Mindi said before a blood test earlier this year, she and Mark thought Isaac's health was doing well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"With kidneys, it's very hard. It's hard to tell if someone is non-verbal and someone is just always happy, you can't tell that there's anything wrong, other than having blood tests constantly," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Mindi said it was a bit of a shock when doctors informed the Piaseckis in January that Isaac would be put on the transplant waiting list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While there is no way of knowing a specific time frame, Mindi said she estimates Isaac will need to go on dialysis in six months to a year if he cannot get a kidney in that time. If that happens, the Piaseckis will need more consistent overnight caretakers than just Mindi at their home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Currently, Mindi spends nights in Levon's room. The one-year-old relies on a tracheostomy tube and a machine called a pulse oximeter to breathe. Overnight, he is hooked up to "all sorts of bells and whistles and alarms" that notify Mindi if he needs any attention, like to suction his trach or provide oxygen, Mindi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The couple adopted Levon in March 2024. At the time, they had been looking to grow their family, but had not planned on adopting a child with special needs that required significantly more training and learning. Mark and Mindi have a history of caring for children with special needs, between their own children and children they fostered previously, but they had never taken care of a child with a trach — or even seen one up close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But then the adoption agency contacted the Piaseckis to tell them about a baby named Levi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Ironically, my husband and I had discussed what we would name a child if we adopted a fifth child, and we had chosen the name Levon, after the Elton John song 'Levon,' and we were going to call him Levi," Mindi said. "So when the agency told us that that was what his legal name was, it was serendipity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Levon has &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22808-goldenhar-syndrome" data-type="link" data-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22808-goldenhar-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Goldenhar Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, and in addition to the trach, he uses a feeding tube because he does not have operation of his mouth. Though only 20 pounds, Levon is a fighter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"He is very feisty, and it's kept him alive," Mindi said. "He's just full of personality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Because of his respiratory challenges, Levon needs to be hospitalized whenever he contracts a virus, Mindi said. He was hospitalized earlier this month after a sickness went around the Piasecki family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When Levon and Isaac go to the hospital, they go to &lt;a href="https://childrenswi.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://childrenswi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Children's Wisconsin in Milwaukee&lt;/a&gt;, due to its ability to meet their medical needs. Mindi said the nurses and front desk workers have come to know their family from all the time spent there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We feel like we're home when we go there, which is kind of sad that a hospital is home to us, but between the hospital and the Ronald McDonald House, they have saved our family," Mindi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/19/PAPN/79225941007-piasecki-family-4.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/19/PAPN/79225941007-piasecki-family-4.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=800&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Isaac and Adam Piasecki pose for a photo.

She said her 8-year-old son, Adam, who is neurotypical, struggles to be away from Isaac when Isaac is at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"He's been his best friend since we adopted Isaac," Mindi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Still, all five children are handling the challenging circumstances well, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong class="gnt_ar_b_al"&gt;RELATED:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/story/news/2018/07/09/neenah-couple-mindi-mark-piasecki-hopes-adopted-family-continue-grow-kids-special-needs-adoption/750957002/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" data-t-l=":b|e|spike click:42|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;'It's what we do': Neenah family grows as couple adopts children with special needs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Shortage of at-home nurses is a widespread issue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/code/admin_code/dhs/101/107/12/2" data-type="link" data-id="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/code/admin_code/dhs/101/107/12/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Wisconsin law&lt;/a&gt; permits people with some medical conditions that require continuous care to have private duty nursing paid for by the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Levon qualifies for 20 hours of state-funded private duty nursing a day, funded through Wisconsin Medicaid. Mindi said the family currently gets about 16 hours of help per week, from one nurse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Private duty nurses, who are typically contract workers, in general don't have the same health benefits nurses working in a hospital have.

"We don't have something similar for kids, so when they have extreme needs like this, the system is really not set up to meet those needs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Piaseckis also qualify for respite care — where a non-nurse caretaker comes to a family's home to give the primary caregivers a break — through the &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/clts/index.htm" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/clts/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Children’s Long-Term Support Program&lt;/a&gt;, or CLTS.

So home care agencies in our area are more often funding nursing care and personal care services for adults than they are for children," Wagner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As the family waits to see if Isaac will get a new kidney, Mindi continues to search for nursing help for her children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"They are an exceptional family," Frank said. "They have given so much of themselves to their children, and are so devoted and dedicated to their care, that it is really unfortunate that we cannot figure out a way to give them the support that they need."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In the meantime, Mindi said she encourages people to research &lt;a href="https://www.froedtert.com/transplant/kidney-transplant/living-donor" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.froedtert.com/transplant/kidney-transplant/living-donor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;live kidney donation&lt;/a&gt;, and to get tested to see if they can be a donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"The fact is, the more people that are tested, the more lives can be saved.

Older adults are more likely than younger adults to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and are at the greatest risk of severe complications from the virus.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2830683"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;looked at all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalizations in adults in Ontario, Canada. Between April 1 and November 30, 2022, Ontario implemented an age-restrictive policy on access to Paxlovid, with only those 70 and older able to get the drug.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since the strongest predictor of severe COVID-19 is advanced age, it has been crucial to obtain evidence on whether the results of the Pfizer trials generalized to older and vaccinated populations,” said John Mafi, MD the study’s lead author in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074346"&gt;&lt;u&gt;press release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the Univeristy of California Los Angeles.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors compared outcomes among adults just under 70 years who were not prescribed Paxlovid to those who were given the antiviral. The authors identified 1,620,884 Ontarians aged 65 to 74 years during the study period; most (87.5%) received at least 2 COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paxlovid's effect 4 times weaker than in clinical trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the authors found the prescription rate of Paxlovid more than doubled after the age-based policy was put in place, increasing by 118% at age 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the increased use of Paxlovid did not result in fewer hospitalizations or deaths for those treated with the medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no significant differences just below compared with just above age 70 years (per 10,000 patients per month) in COVID-19-related hospitalizations (39.5 vs 42.9) or all-cause mortality (109.6 vs 115.7).&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors said the study showed Paxlovid’s effect on COVID-19 hospitalization among vaccinated older adults is four times weaker than the effect originally reported in Pfizer’s 2022 clinical trial, reducing hospitalizations by 1.3 percentage points. The original clinical trial showed an absolute risk reduction of 5.5 percentage points against hospitalizations.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since the study found no significant effect on COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths among vaccinated older adults, our findings underscore the urgent need for further randomized-clinical trials investigating Paxlovid’s effects in higher-risk populations, such as older subgroups who are frail or immunosuppressed,” Katherine Kahn, MD, another study author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Rice University and Vanderbilt University have made significant advancements in the fight against prostate cancer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They have shown that combining a small-molecule therapy called tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) with focused ultrasound (FUS) can effectively reduce tumor size in laboratory models.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings were published in the journal Advanced Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-focused-ultrasound"&gt;Focused ultrasound &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide, claiming approximately 10 million lives annually. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The collaborative study, spearheaded by Michael King, a professor of bioengineering at Rice, and Charles Caskey, an associate professor at Vanderbilt, is pioneering in its approach. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It highlights how low-intensity mechanical forces can be utilized with TRAIL to provide a new treatment strategy for cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;King highlights the pressing need for better treatment options for advanced and recurrent prostate cancer, which ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Prostate cancer is also the most commonly diagnosed cancer in over 100 countries,” he notes, highlighting the urgency for innovative therapeutic strategies. He expresses optimism that their findings could soon translate to practical clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditional treatments for prostate cancer often come with severe side effects, causing a growing interest in FUS therapies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This non-invasive method enables targeted treatment directly at tumor sites, which can limit damaging effects on surrounding healthy tissues. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shrinking-prostate-tumors"&gt;Shrinking prostate tumors&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges with TRAIL therapy is its short lifespan in the bloodstream, lasting only about 30 minutes before being metabolized. This necessitates frequent dosing to achieve any substantial effect, which can lead to increased side effects and patient inconvenience. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“TRAIL specifically triggers the death of cancer cells while sparing healthy ones,” King explains, noting that previous studies indicated mechanical forces like fluid shear stress (FSS) could enhance TRAIL’s anticancer effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, FSS operates primarily within the circulatory system, limiting its effectiveness to circulating tumor cells and not addressing solid tumors directly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This limitation highlighted the need for a practical method that combines mechanical forces with TRAIL therapy in a localized manner. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers sought to explore whether FUS could serve as a viable partner for TRAIL in treating primary prostate tumors before they metastasize.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In their investigation, graduate students Abigail Fabiano and Malachy Newman conducted experiments using prostate cancer cell lines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-no-surgery-needed"&gt;No surgery needed&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their objective involved varying the &lt;a href="https://news.rice.edu/news/2025/rice-led-study-finds-focused-ultrasound-therapy-improves-cancer-treatment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;parameters&lt;/a&gt; of FUS treatment to ensure that healthy cells were not adversely affected by mechanical forces while maximizing the effects on cancer cells. The results were promising. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the combined application of FUS and TRAIL substantially diminished the number of cancer cells and the overall size of tumors compared to administering either treatment alone. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This foundational study lays the groundwork for a potential new &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/health/prostate-cancer-breakthrough-speed-up-research" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;therapy&lt;/a&gt; for prostate cancer,” King states, underscoring the importance of their research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their findings could open new avenues in medical treatment, indicating a future where mechanical therapies like focused ultrasound are used alongside small-molecule treatments to tackle various cancers more effectively while minimizing adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the researchers continue to refine their approach, the hope is that &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/science/3d-genetic-map-prostate-cancer" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; insights will benefit patients with prostate cancer and pave the way for innovative cancer therapies that enhance the efficacy and safety of existing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

The issue: Sifting through the ever-growing array to find high-quality, healthful options requires some skill (and some patience).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="base paragraph" data-testid="article-1:default:blockRenderer:2:paragraph"&gt;That’s why we tapped registered dietitian &lt;a data-moduletype="Article Body" data-elementclicked="Body Text Link" href="https://www.instagram.com/realnutrition/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;Amy Shapiro&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, CDN for a little navigational help. For starters, here’s a quick refresher on the super nutrient that’s taken center stage: “Protein plays a vital role in overall health, including hormone and immune function, making it a crucial part of any balanced diet,” Shapiro says. “Short-term benefits include improved satiety, &lt;a data-moduletype="Article Body" data-elementclicked="Body Text Link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14522731/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;blood-sugar control&lt;/a&gt;, mental clarity, and muscle recovery after exercise.

Her general rule of thumb? “Look for products with five to 10 grams of protein per serving [and] ideally more protein than sugar.” (Minimal added sugar is best, she says.) “[Opt for] high-quality protein sources like whey, casein, plant-based proteins, or collagen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="base paragraph" data-testid="article-1:default:blockRenderer:5:paragraph"&gt;Getting hungry yet?

She loves that these are plant-based, contain minimal processed ingredients, and come with a solid serving of fiber alongside their six grams of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="base paragraph" data-testid="article-1:default:blockRenderer:15:paragraph"&gt;“This is a plant-based complete protein with minimal ingredients and no added color,” Shapiro says. “It’s savory and crunchy—a whole food option.” Enjoy the sea salt, sriracha, or buffalo flavors by the handful, or sprinkle them on a salad for a little extra spice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="base paragraph" data-testid="article-1:default:blockRenderer:20:paragraph"&gt;This soft, brownie-batter-flavored bar is made with &lt;a data-moduletype="Article Body" data-elementclicked="Body Text Link" href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/collagen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;collagen&lt;/a&gt;, which Shapiro says can help with joint and skin health, plus 17 grams of protein. “I like that this is sweetened with sugar, but not too much, and the protein outweighs the sugar.” Close your eyes as you take a bite—it’s just like licking the spatula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="base paragraph" data-testid="article-1:default:blockRenderer:23:paragraph"&gt;For an energy boost, Shapiro recommends these honey-cinnamon-PB (the ultimate triple threat?) bars. “Although there is more sugar than protein here, it still has 10 grams of protein, is made with whole food ingredients like nuts and oats, has no artificial colors or sweeteners, and contains four grams of fiber.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="base paragraph" data-testid="article-1:default:blockRenderer:26:paragraph"&gt;While Shapiro’s all for high-quality protein bars and chips (when they’re made with the right ingredients, of course), she seeks out whole-food ingredients over processed ones whenever she can.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2025.2469643?src=exp-la"&gt;&lt;span&gt;research letter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; published this week in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Emerging Microbes &amp;amp; Infections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, researchers at the Canada Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) describe their discovery of a mutated H5N1 avian flu strain resistant to the antiviral drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu) on eight chicken farms in British Columbia in October 2024.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When investigating a widespread and ongoing H5N1 outbreak at 45 poultry farms, the CFIA National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease team sequenced the virus, identifying it as a clade 2.3.4.4b A(H5N1) strain. The virus had a neuraminidase surface protein derived from a low-pathogenic flu virus from a North American lineage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite evidence to suggest this substitution reduces viral fitness, viruses harboring this substitution spread rapidly across 8 farms in the 15 days following its initial detection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Isolates from 8 farms reveal a mutation in the neuraminidase protein (H275Y) that is exceptionally rare among clade 2.3.4.4b viruses (present in 0.045% of publicly available clade 2.3.4.4b isolates)," the researchers wrote. "NA-H275Y is a well-known marker of resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The virus likely emerged in Canada in September 2024, the authors said. The US Department of Agriculture later updated its North American A(H5N1) genotyping tool GenoFlu to designate the virus as genotype D1.1. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Despite evidence to suggest this substitution reduces viral fitness, viruses harboring this substitution spread rapidly across 8 farms in the 15 days following its initial detection," the researchers wrote. "As oseltamivir is the most widely used therapeutic and prophylactic against IAV [influenza A virus], the continued circulation of viruses harboring NA-H275Y may necessitate a re-evaluation of influenza treatment strategies in Canada."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's unclear whether the mutated virus is still circulating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four more H5N1 detections in US&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yesterday, the US Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed four more highly pathogenic &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks"&gt;&lt;span&gt;avian flu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; detections, including a commercial turkey farm in Sac County, Iowa, affecting nearly 30,000 birds and three backyard flocks in Maine and Pennsylvania totaling nearly 500 birds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the last 30 days, 101 commercial and 55 backyard flocks have been infected, at a loss of 21.7 million birds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are fasting, calorie counting and deprivation slowing your metabolism and preventing you from meeting your weight loss goals?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The basic theory behind a calorie deficit is simple: Burn more calories than you consume and your body will dip into its fat reserves for energy, leading to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jillbrownfitness.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jill Brown&lt;/a&gt;, a certified master health coach and nutrition expert, told The Post that this concept is known in fitness circles as CICO, or “calories in, calories out.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But what does it mean if you’re counting calories and not getting results?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The basic theory behind a calorie deficit is simple: Burn more calories than you consume and your body will dip into its fat reserves for energy, leading to weight loss. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Charlie's – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women typically need to eat between 1,800 and 2,400 calories daily to maintain their weight, while men require around 2,000 to 3,000, according to the USDA’s &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts agree that weight loss happens when the body is in a calorie deficit. But determining how many calories you consume and what equals a deficit is slippery math.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199212313272701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;landmark study&lt;/a&gt; found that people miscalculate how many calories they take in by as much as 1,000 calories a day. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Really counting calories&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When people tell me they’re in a calorie deficit, I ask them, ‘How do you know?’ They can’t really answer.  The truth is, if you’re not losing weight, you’re simply not in a calorie deficit,” said Brown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brown explained that part of the disconnect between counting calories and losing weight is that most folks don’t know their exact resting metabolic rate, or RMR.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Home smart scales are unreliable, and I see many people using this as their primary measurement,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, “getting a DEXA scan that measures your body composition is your best option,” Brown said. “The next best would be an InBody machine. These machines will give you an estimate of your RMR, or how many calories your body burns a day doing nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These machine-generated estimates are based on body weight, muscle mass, bone mass and fat mass, providing a more accurate picture of your caloric expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brown explained that online calculators only factor in age, height, weight and self-reported activity level, leaving ample room for error.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They can be off by as much as 20% to 30% in normal, young, healthy people. They may be even further off for older people or those who have illnesses or obesity. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Not to mention, none of these calculators factor in medications or gut health status.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brown noted that some drugs can mess with your hunger, alter your gut biome and even slow your metabolism, making it that much harder to create a calorie deficit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;But how do you count calories without tech?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those looking to nail a calorie deficit without integrating technology, Brown recommends a good old-fashioned food diary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I have my clients honestly log everything they eat (even little sips and licks) for a good week or two and weigh in daily. If the scale is still the same at the end of the week, they’re burning as many calories as they’re taking in,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Brown, once that baseline is established, it’s easy to find ways to reach a deficit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Eat a little less (think smaller portions, skipping snacks or not having desserts), do a little more physical activity and get good sleep, and you’ll be in a deficit,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Brown explained that online calculators only factor in age, height, weight, and self-reported activity level, leaving ample room for error. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Monkey Business – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;While a deficit is a healthy goal, Brown says &lt;em&gt;deprivation&lt;/em&gt; is not only ineffective but counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Extreme calorie deficits only work in the short term because they place a huge amount of stress on the body,” said Brown.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“If you try to do this for weeks or months, your hunger hormones will go nuts and compel you to eat back all those calories. If you continue to fight through it, your body will respond by slowing down its metabolic rate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you continue to eat an extremely low-calorie diet, your body will simply burn less calories to preserve energy. You will even burn less calories when you exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brown also noted that regular exercise suppresses hunger, but over-exertion amplifies it. Thus, she recommends people find a sweet spot between challenge and exhaustion that works for them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She counts rest and relaxation as additional requisites for weight loss: “Getting quality sleep while managing stress prevents those sneaky hunger hormones from derailing you when you don’t realize it.”&lt;/p&gt;
