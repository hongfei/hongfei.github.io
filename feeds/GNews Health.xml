Those who do may get a flu-like illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A small number of people infected with polio - between one in a thousand and one in a hundred - develop more serious problems that can lead to paralysis. This is also when the disease becomes life-threatening, particularly when paralysis affects muscles used for breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Papua New Guinea was said to be polio-free since 2000, &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44614382" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;until an outbreak in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, which was contained within the same year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The latest cases were found to be carrying a virus strain genetically linked to one circulating in Indonesia. Papua New Guinea shares a border with Indonesia's easternmost Papua province. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Health Minister Elias Kapavore has vowed to achieve 100% polio immunisation in the country by the end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There is no excuse... Polio is a serious disease," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The ongoing campaign will target children aged 10 and below and is expected to reach around 3.5 million people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The battle on polio starts today," the department wrote in a Facebook post yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The WHO, UN's children agency Unicef and Australia's government are supporting Papua New Guinea in its rollout of vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Unicef's Papua New Guinea representative Veera Mendonca pointed out the disparity in vaccination coverage across the country - with coverage as low as 8% in some districts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"That is not acceptable," she said, adding that Unicef is working with churches and community leaders to encourage vaccination and to dispel any misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Polio has staged a comeback elsewhere in Asia in recent years.

			&lt;p&gt;We're all aware of the psychological pain of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-world-s-loneliest-gannet-has-died-by-the-side-of-his-only-love"&gt;a broken heart&lt;/a&gt; – countless books, songs, and movies have been written and made on the topic – but there's also scientific evidence that a broken heart can be fatal too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical term is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takotsubo_cardiomyopathy"&gt;takotsubo cardiomyopathy&lt;/a&gt; (TC), a weakening of the heart brought on by physical or emotional stress. A new study from researchers at the University of Arizona looked at data on 199,890 patients in the US between 2016 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Incidence of TC rose slightly over the study period for both males and females, but overall incidence was generally higher for females. Fatalities and complications caused by the condition were relatively high&lt;/span&gt;. This fits in with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ahj.2015.10.022"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; suggesting this 'broken heart syndrome' is becoming more common in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the condition was more common in women, deaths were more than twice as likely in men, with 11.2 percent of males dying compared with 5.5 percent of females. The overall death rate was 6.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We were surprised to find that the death rate from takotsubo cardiomyopathy was relatively high without significant changes over the five-year study, and the rate of in-hospital complications also was elevated," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/the-risk-of-death-or-complications-from-broken-heart-syndrome-was-high-from-2016-to-2020"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; interventional cardiologist M. Reza Movahed, from the University of Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers have put forward a hypothesis for the gap between men and women. TC is believed to be brought on by a surge of stress hormones, triggered by either physical or emotional stress – so a physical stress might be surgery or an infection, whereas emotional stress could be a divorce or the death of a loved one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161618" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161618" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/HeartCases.jpg" alt="Broken heart mortality rates" class="wp-image-161618 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/HeartCases.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/HeartCases-600x347.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161618" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mortality rates stayed high, but were higher for men. (Movahed et al., &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical stress TC &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2011.11.027"&gt;is more common&lt;/a&gt; in men, which may explain the higher numbers of deaths brought on by the condition. The researchers also think differences in hormone balances between the sexes could play a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complications resulting from TC included congestive heart failure (35.9 percent of patients), &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation"&gt;atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt; (20.7 percent), &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiogenic_shock"&gt;cardiogenic shock&lt;/a&gt; (6.6 percent), stroke (5.3 percent) and cardiac arrest (3.4 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TC is often marked down as a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cardiac-arrest-and-heart-attacks-arent-the-same-heres-how-to-tell-them-apart"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; or chest pain, because of the similarity of the symptoms. But the researchers behind the new study are hoping to raise awareness of the condition, so that it can be better diagnosed and treated more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Some complications, such as embolic stroke, may be preventable with an early initiation of anti-clotting medications in patients with a substantially weakened heart muscle or with an irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation that increases the risk of stroke," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/the-risk-of-death-or-complications-from-broken-heart-syndrome-was-high-from-2016-to-2020"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Movahed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TC is something that health professionals have known about for a while, but there are still plenty of unanswered questions about the condition – both in how it might be detected and how the risk of complications could be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every case of TC is caused by relationship breakups, but it's clear that losing someone we love &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/yes-you-can-die-from-a-broken-heart-new-study-shows-how-damaging-losing-a-loved-one-really-is"&gt;has multiple consequences&lt;/a&gt; for our physical and mental health, and that the heart can sometimes take the brunt of the stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The continued high death rate is alarming, suggesting that more research be done for better treatment and finding new therapeutic approaches to this condition," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/the-risk-of-death-or-complications-from-broken-heart-syndrome-was-high-from-2016-to-2020"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Movahed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.037219"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, few things have inspired &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/online-wellness-content-3-ways-to-tell-evidence-based-health-information-from-pseudoscience-224119"&gt;as much quackery&lt;/a&gt; as the pills, potions and promises to slow ageing, boost vitality, or extend life. Yet, amid the hype and hollow claims, a few golden truths remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far back as 400 BC, Hippocrates, widely considered the father of modern medicine, famously said, "Walking is man's best medicine." More than two millennia later, science is finally catching up with that wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who walk more than 8,000 steps a day &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30211-4/fulltext"&gt;reduce their risk of premature death&lt;/a&gt; by half, compared to those who walk fewer than 5,000 steps – the threshold for a sedentary lifestyle. But beyond 8,000 steps, the benefits tend to plateau, which challenges the long-held belief in the magic of 10,000 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, that benchmark wasn't born of science, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/counting-every-step-you-take"&gt;but of marketing&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-42864061"&gt;10,000-step goal&lt;/a&gt; originated from a &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj.q598"&gt;1960s Japanese advertising campaign&lt;/a&gt; for the world's first commercial pedometer called the &lt;em&gt;manpo-kei&lt;/em&gt;, which literally translates to "10,000 steps meter".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, researchers have been exploring a simple but important question: does every step count the same, or can walking faster – at a brisk pace of more than 100 steps a minute, or around three to four miles per hour – actually give you more health benefits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ageing and heart health there is mounting evidence that pace really matters. Simply converting a 14-minute daily stroll into a seven-minute brisk walk has been associated with a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae506"&gt;14% reduction in heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An analysis of more than 450,000 adults in the UK used a genetic marker of biological age to reveal that by middle age, a lifetime of brisk walking reduces biological age by up to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03323-x"&gt;16 years&lt;/a&gt; compared to a lifetime of slow walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A follow-up study suggested it is never too late to benefit from brisk walking. An inactive 60-year woman or man was modelled to gain around an additional &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jshs.2024.100970"&gt;year of life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; through simply introducing a ten minute brisk walk into their daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tYiLJ3rzkoU?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power of brisk walking can also be seen in its ability to predict future health outcomes. It has been shown to be a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/2047487319887281"&gt;stronger predictor&lt;/a&gt; of the risk of dying from heart disease than traditional predictors such as blood pressure and cholesterol, while also being a more powerful predictor than many other measures of lifestyle – including diet, obesity levels, and total physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, perhaps the single most informative question a doctor could ask their patient is: "How fast is your walking pace in comparison to other people?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Halo of benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But brisk walking may not provide additional benefits for all outcomes or in all contexts. For example, the benefit of brisk walking over light-intensity walking in lowering  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="161641" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; risk is less certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study suggested that although total walking was associated with reduction in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2024-109360"&gt;13 different types of cancers&lt;/a&gt;, there was no added value from brisk walking. Breaking prolonged sitting with light-intensity pottering around has also been shown to have profound impacts on metabolic effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, walking has a halo of benefits beyond physical health. It can help with brain activity, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/a0036577"&gt;doubling creative idea production&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, the systems in the brain that support memory and imagination are also the same as those activated during whole body movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us already harness this very phenomenon, using walking to mull over problems and arrive at solutions or insights that would otherwise remain elusive. Context is also important here, with the mental health and cognitive benefits of walking thought to be enhanced when walking through nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So called "nature prescriptions" for clinical populations have harnessed these principles to increase walking activity and improving both mental and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h29z-l3XTlk?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical inactivity is a major driver of the modern  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="161641" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;epidemic&lt;/a&gt; of long-term conditions, such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="161641" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and heart disease, that are now observed in industrialised and developing economies alike. It has been estimated that 3.9 million premature deaths could be averted annually through targeting physical inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, instead of prevention, medical systems are largely based on management – people get ill and are then prescribed medicines to treat the illness. On average it takes $1 billion to bring a new drug to market which, despite these research and development costs, still go on to generate sizeable profits for shareholders showing the scale of the health economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If just a fraction of these costs were diverted into public health initiatives aimed at increasing walking and physical activity opportunities for all, the need for an ever more sophisticated medical management ecosphere may retreat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, when searching for the elixir of life, you could do worse than looking down at your feet.&lt;em&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255655/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/thomas-e-yates-2383889"&gt;Thomas E.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PORTLAND, Ore. — Multnomah County public health officials have confirmed one case of tuberculosis at Southeast Portland's Lane Middle School. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person had been recently diagnosed with active pulmonary tuberculosis but may have been contagious between Sept. 3, 2024, and May 1, 2025, exposing others, officials said. Those who have been potentially exposed have been contacted by the Multnomah County Health Department via an emailed letter. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;County officials added that there is little risk to the general public at this time and they are not aware of any cases connected to the infectious person. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portland Public Schools said that the Lane Middle School community can join a &lt;a href="http://meet.google.com/xsi-nntk-hqz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;virtual meeting&lt;/a&gt;, also being held in-person at the middle school, at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, May 20, for more information about testing, as well as potential testing locations and times.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with &lt;a href="https://multco.us/news/faq-tuberculosis-exposure-and-steps-take" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;questions &lt;/a&gt;can call the Multnomah County Health Department Tuberculosis Clinic at 503-988-3406; the department will also be providing free blood tests to the school community in the coming weeks. Those doing a TB test with a personal health care provider should call the Multnomah County Health Department Tuberculosis Clinic at 503-988-3406.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fortunately, most people who have had casual contact with a person diagnosed with tuberculosis will not become infected,” said Multnomah County Health Officer Dr. Richard Bruno in a statement Thursday. “And most people who become infected will never become ill with tuberculosis, especially with current medication regimens. While tuberculosis can be spread in school settings, we expect that anyone infected would not yet be ill and could be effectively treated with medication.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county said it works with up to 30 tuberculous cases a year. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Tuberculous&lt;/a&gt;, a bacteria that spreads through close face-to-face contact for several hours or daily contact through weeks or months, is curable with medication, but the infection progresses slowly, so it is important to be treated in order to prevent serious illness. Tuberculous is not spread by sharing clothing, dishes or drinking glasses, and it does not live on surfaces and is not spread through contact like shaking hands. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include coughing, chest pain and coughing up blood or phlegm; people with inactive TB do not have symptoms and cannot spread it to others.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests that moderate amounts of zinc can help slow down aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers found that adding exercise may enhance the effects of zinc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s worth noting that too much zinc can increase the speed of aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many of us are continually looking for ways to slow down or reverse aging, and one thing that makes us age more quickly is inflammation. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/anti-inflammatory-diet-linked-with-lower-risk-of-cognitive-impairment-8641170" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;we previously reported&lt;/a&gt; on research that suggests that an anti-inflammatory diet may reduce the risk of cognitive impairment—brain aging—by 21%. And another study suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/tea-aging-study-11731249" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;eating more antioxidant-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;—which are anti-inflammatory—may help you live longer with a higher quality of life. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of these anti-inflammatory nutrients is zinc, an essential trace mineral that you must get from food or supplements since the body does not make it on its own. While you don’t need a lot of zinc each day, this antioxidant-acting mineral plays an important role in supporting DNA, wound healing and immunity—all things that influence aging. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Scientists have jumped on the anti-aging bandwagon, not just to prevent it, but to measure it. Tools that use algorithms to determine people’s biological age are now available and often used in studies. Biological age is defined as the chronological age-dependent decline of biological functions, characterized by 12 biomarkers that fall under three categories that can be measured with bloodwork. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, while chronological age is how old you are in years from birth to now, biological age is the speed at which your body is aging. For example, a 48-year-old woman’s biological aging may be keeping pace with her chronological age—or it could be aging more slowly or faster than an average 48-year-old woman. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers from China wanted to know more about the role of zinc in biological aging, plus how exercise might modify zinc’s effect on aging.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They recently published their findings in the journal &lt;em&gt;Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s break them down.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Data was pulled from the UK Biobank, a long-term study that contains medical and lifestyle information on over 500,000 UK residents. For this current study, researchers drew data on almost 69,000 people who met their criteria, which included having sufficient information on diet, physical activity and biomarkers to calculate biological age. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants were divided into two groups: one group without zinc intake and one with it. The group without zinc included over 35,000 people with an average age of 56; 46% were female. The zinc group included over 33,000 people with an average age of 56; about 65% were female.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Zinc intake was calculated based on participants’ food records and responses to questions about supplements. Participants’ zinc intake amounts were compared against the daily recommended intake of 11 mg per day for male participants and at least 8 mg per day for female participants, with neither going over 40 mg per day. Over 40 mg/day is considered zinc overdose for both males and females.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The exercise amount was calculated based on standard questionnaires regarding physical activity and was transposed into metabolic equivalent of task (MET). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends at least 600 MET per week, which is equivalent to at least 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week or 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Biological aging was calculated using the ENABL Age tool, which, according to these researchers, is the most up-to-date estimation tool for distinguishing healthy aging from unhealthy aging, and for predicting mortality for 5- and 10-year mortality markers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Confounding factors that affect biological aging and would be adjusted for during statistical analyses included sex, ethnicity group, BMI, family income, sleep disorders, smoking status, alcohol intake and history of cancer diagnosis.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-show"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Show? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, this study suggests that participants with delayed biological aging—meaning they’re aging more slowly—tend to have higher levels of daily zinc intake compared to participants with accelerated aging. Specifically, those who got the recommended amount of zinc each day showed an average delay of 0.11 years in biological aging. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, as with most things, more is not necessarily better, as those with zinc intakes over the recommended limit of 40 mg/day showed an acceleration of almost 7 years in biological aging. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The analysis that included exercise suggests that participants with the recommended dose of zinc intake plus the recommended amount of physical activity had 31% decreased odds of having biological aging acceleration compared to participants with inadequate zinc intake and inadequate physical activity. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some limitations of this study include the narrow population, since the UK Biobank is mostly made up of white people of European descent. The nature of this observational study cannot conclude causation; in other words, researchers cannot say that zinc causes slower aging, just that it’s associated with it. Also, diet and physical activity information was self-reported, which always leaves room for error and bias.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-relate-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Relate to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to these researchers, insufficient zinc intake affects approximately 17% of people around the globe, and for this reason, they state that zinc supplements may be useful for some. However, this also comes with caution, as too much zinc speeds up aging—by a lot. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers aren’t exactly sure why zinc seems to slow aging, but they know that zinc influences age-related processes, including DNA synthesis, protein metabolism, cell proliferation (generating new cells) and mitosis (cell replication). Zinc has also been linked with bone health, immunity support, healthy hormones and the prevention of nervous system diseases, like Alzheimer’s. It also acts like an antioxidant, reducing inflammation, researchers add. And &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-inflammation-ages-you-8744048" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;less inflammation means slower aging&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking to eat your zinc, aim for sources like seafood, meat, poultry, dairy, nuts and seeds. Both our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-high-protein-meal-plan-for-healthy-aging-8777942" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;30-Day High-Protein Meal Plan for Healthy Aging&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-anti-inflammatory-meal-plan-for-healthy-aging-11711460" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;30-Day Anti-Inflammatory Meal Plan for Healthy Aging&lt;/a&gt; contain plenty of healthy-aging foods, including those high in zinc. If you need more guidance to ensure you’re eating for healthy aging, make an appointment with a registered dietitian to help you design a plan based on your needs, lifestyle and preferences. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study also included the role of physical activity, noting that when combined with sufficient zinc intake, aging was slowed even further. The study didn’t differentiate between types of exercise—like cardio versus strength training—just that participants were meeting minimal guidelines. If you’re currently not physically active, just start moving more throughout the day and be intentional about it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, do more trips into the house from the car with groceries, or up and down the stairs when putting laundry away. Take frequent breaks throughout the day to stretch, do a set of squats or walk a lap around the house. Over time, gradually increase the amount until you’re more closely meeting the minimum recommendation of 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study suggests that adequate zinc intake can slow biological aging, even more so when combined with exercise. But researchers also found that too much zinc was associated with much faster biological aging. Consider assessing which foods you’re currently eating that provide zinc. If you think you’re not getting enough, choose which foods to add. But before supplementing with zinc, meet with your healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to make sure you don’t get more of it than your body needs.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t go breaking my heart.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When a loved one passes on and your heart aches — there’s a name for that, and apparently, men are more likely to die from it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The technical term for “&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/08/28/laughter-can-heal-a-broken-heart-literally-cardiac-health-study/"&gt;broken heart&lt;/a&gt; syndrome” is takotsubo cardiomyopathy — and people are diagnosed with it when stress hormones like adrenaline prevent their hearts from properly contracting. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a serious condition brought on by very stressful situations and extreme emotions that doctors don’t take lightly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While women are known to more often suffer from the syndrome — men are the ones actually dying from it at more than twice the rate, according to a new study published in the &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.037219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting point the study made is that &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/08/28/laughter-can-heal-a-broken-heart-literally-cardiac-health-study/"&gt;broken heart&lt;/a&gt; syndrome is “triggered by emotional stress, predominantly in women, or physical stress, predominantly in men.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;To come to this conclusion, researchers observed almost 2,000 patients older than 18-years-old diagnosed with the condition from 2016 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study found that the mortality rate of brokenhearted men was a staggering 11.2% compared to only 5.5% of the female patients. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers reportedly concluded that those who died most likely suffered complications from the condition, like irregular heartbeat, cardiac arrest, congestive heart failure and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

885px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The study found that the mortality rate of brokenhearted men was a staggering 11.2% compared to only 5.5% of the female patients.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;LIGHTFIELD STUDIOS – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Men may be more at risk for dying and having bad outcomes because they’re less susceptible to begin with,” Dr. Ilan Wittstein, a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins Medicine, told &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/men-are-likely-die-broken-heart-syndrome-study-says-rcna206276" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“So it takes a more dangerous trigger to precipitate the syndrome.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s important to keep in mind that just because you’re feeling blue over something doesn’t necessarily mean you have the condition. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Wittstein, those with underlying health issues, especially relating to the heart — like high blood pressure or high cholesterol — are more susceptible to takotsubo cardiomyopathy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And unfortunately, there isn’t any treatment or medication for it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In certain situations, doctors will prescribe patients medicine used to treat other heart conditions, but that’s on a case-by-case basis. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes down to it, experts advise people to seek medical attention if they’re feeling unusual chest pains or symptoms — and to manage stress levels, which can be challenging in this day and age. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As we advance in age and take on more life and work responsibilities, we experience higher stress levels,” Dr. Susan Cheng &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2021/10/13/broken-heart-syndrome-is-on-the-rise-especially-among-older-women" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;told American Heart Association News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“And with increasing digitization around every aspect of our lives, environmental stressors have also intensified.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Aside from lowering stress levels, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/13/health/just-3-days-of-this-bad-habit-can-increase-heart-disease-risk/"&gt;getting sufficient sleep&lt;/a&gt; is another way people can lower their risk of developing heart-related issues, according to another &lt;a href="https://www.uu.se/en/press/press-releases/2025/2025-05-08-lack-of-sleep-can-increase-the-risk-of-cardiovascular-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With this study, we have improved our understanding of what role the amount of sleep we get plays in cardiovascular health,” Cedernaes said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to point out that studies have also shown that physical exercise can offset at least some of the negative effects that poor sleep can cause,” he added. “But it’s also important to note that exercise cannot replace the essential functions of sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s recommended for adults to get seven to nine hours of sleep a night — so there’s another reason why you should put away your phone to get a good night’s snooze. &lt;/p&gt;

Using fMRI data from over 1,500 healthy participants, researchers found that sensory input, regardless of the type, engages the midbrain reticular formation and central thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These areas are crucial for regulating alertness, attention, and awareness. The surprising discovery highlights a shared subcortical network for sensory attention, deepening our understanding of how consciousness is organized in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Brain Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; All senses activated the same deep brain regions when participants paid close attention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Activity in the midbrain and thalamus was strongest during tasks requiring sharp focus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; The results could lead to better treatments for ADHD and consciousness disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Yale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humans perceive and navigate the world around us with the help of our five senses: sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while scientists have long known that these different senses activate different parts of the brain, a new Yale-led study indicates that multiple senses all stimulate a critical region deep in the brain that controls consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109996"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The key to stimulating the critical central brain regions, they found, were the sudden shifts in attention demanded by the tasks. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published May 15 in the journal &lt;em&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/em&gt;, sheds new light on how sensory perception works in the brain and may fuel the development of therapies to treat disorders involving attention, arousal, and consciousness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, a research team led by Yale’s Aya Khalaf focused on the workings of subcortical arousal systems, brain structure networks that play a crucial role in regulating sleep-wake states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies on patients with disorders of consciousness — such as coma or epilepsy — have confirmed the influence of these systems on states of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But prior research has been largely limited to tracking individual senses. For the new study, researchers asked if stimuli from multiple senses share the same subcortical arousal networks. They also looked at how shifts in a subject’s attention might affect these networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) datasets collected from 1,561 healthy adult participants as they performed 11 different tasks using four senses: vision, audition, taste, and touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They made two important discoveries: that sensory input &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; make use of shared subcortical systems and, more surprisingly, that all input — regardless of which sense delivered the signal — stimulates activity in two deep brain regions, the midbrain reticular formation and the central thalamus, when a subject is sharply focused on the senses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to stimulating the critical central brain regions, they found, were the sudden shifts in attention demanded by the tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were expecting to find activity on shared networks, but when we saw all the senses light up the same central brain regions while a test subject was focusing, it was really astonishing,” said Khalaf, a postdoctoral associate in neurology at Yale School of Medicine and lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery highlighted how key these central brain regions are in regulating not only disorders of consciousness, but also conditions that impact attention and focus, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding could lead to better targeted medications and brain stimulation techniques for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This has also given us insights into how things work normally in the brain,” said senior author Hal Blumenfeld, the Mark Loughridge and Michele Williams Professor of Neurology who is also a professor in neuroscience and neurosurgery and director of the Yale Clinical Neuroscience Imaging Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really a step forward in our understanding of awareness and consciousness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking across senses, this is the first time researchers have seen a result like this, said Khalaf, who is also part of Blumenfeld’s lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It tells us how important this brain region is and what it could mean in efforts to restore consciousness,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other authors include Erick Lopez, a former undergraduate researcher in Blumenfeld’s lab, and collaborators from Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was supported in part by funding from the National Institutes of

across sensory modalities during transient modulation of attention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subcortical arousal systems are known to play a key role in controlling sustained changes in attention and conscious awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent studies indicate that these systems have a major influence on short-term dynamic modulation of visual attention, but their role across sensory modalities is not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we investigated shared subcortical arousal systems across sensory modalities during transient changes in attention using block and event-related fMRI paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed massive publicly available fMRI datasets collected while 1561 participants performed visual, auditory, tactile, and taste perception tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our analyses revealed a shared circuit of subcortical arousal systems exhibiting early transient increases in activity in midbrain reticular formation and central thalamus across perceptual modalities, as well as less consistent increases in pons, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, and basal ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying these networks is critical for understanding mechanisms of normal attention and consciousness and may help facilitate subcortical targeting for therapeutic neuromodulation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Carriers of recessive gene mutations, long thought to be unaffected, may actually face subtle disadvantages, including more medical issues, shorter educational attainment, and reduced reproductive success. A study of over 300,000 individuals reveals that people who carry recessive genes for intellectual disability are especially impacted, despite having only one mutated gene copy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These carriers were more likely to be childless and had shorter school careers, suggesting evolutionary selection pressures still act on these seemingly silent genes. The findings challenge textbook assumptions and offer new insights into how natural and sexual selection may still shape the human genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Carriers of recessive disease genes show more medical diagnoses and slightly lower reproductive success.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Carriers of intellectual disability genes attend school for fewer years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexual Selection:&lt;/strong&gt; Reduced reproductive success may result from subtle effects that influence mate choice and social outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Radboud University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a group, carriers of recessive disorders are slightly less healthy and have a reduced chance of having offspring. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This disadvantage is greatest for carriers of a recessive gene for intellectual disability, and reflected in a shorter school career and increased childlessness, according to research from Radboudumc published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time to rewrite the textbooks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dominant mutation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Radboudumc, Department of Human Genetics, demonstrated something remarkable in a 2014 publication in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to expectations, inherited variants in genes were rarely responsible for intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the vast majority, the disability arose from a spontaneous mutation: a mutation that neither parent has, but suddenly appears in the child. It is a biological fact that about one hundred spontaneous mutations occur in the hereditary material of each child. Mutations that therefore do not originate from the parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, only one of these one hundred mutations affects a gene. And only a fraction of those affects one of the hundreds of genes that can cause intellectual disability. But rare events still happen. Most intellectual disabilities arise in this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From dominant to recessive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was something else going on,” said Christian Gilissen, professor of Genome Bioinformatics and first author of the 2014 article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Children receive a gene from both father and mother by default. When a single mutation in the child leads to intellectual disability, this is called a mutation in a &lt;em&gt;dominant gene&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other mutations affect &lt;em&gt;recessive genes&lt;/em&gt;. Having a single mutation in a recessive gene, in principle, has no effect on the carrier. A handicap only arises if the mutation is in both copies of the recessive gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our clinic we found very few of these double mutations in recessive genes in children with intellectual disabilities. Strange, because there are more recessive than dominant genes for this. So we wondered: where did all those recessive mutations go?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More medical diagnoses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question led to a long and extensive search, the results of which have now been published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We first investigated how often these recessive mutations occur in the population,” says Han Brunner professor of clinical genetics and, like Gilissen, involved in both publications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do so, the data of more than 300,000 people included in the UK Biobank were examined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that each person carries on average two mutations in any one of 1,900 recessive genes. According to textbooks, carriers of such recessive genes should not experience any disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, we found that, as a group, they do have more medical diagnoses, and slightly less offspring. Thus, they are less likely to pass on their genes for recessive disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to other recessive genes, genes for intellectual disability were the most absent. Apparently, there is another aspect at play here. The UK Biobank data provide a clue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gilissen: “Carriers of a recessive gene for intellectual disability go to school for a shorter time, which suggests that they have a lower level of education. Mind you, these are carriers, according to existing theory, are not affected at all by their recessive gene.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More likely to be childless&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, carriers of recessive genes for intellectual disability have reduced reproductive success and a shorter school career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brunner: “In 1859, Darwin published &lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection&lt;/em&gt;. It was mainly about survival, about genes that make you strong and healthy, about natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Twelve years later he wrote &lt;em&gt;The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex&lt;/em&gt;, in which he refined his theory. You can have fine genes, but if no one wants to have children with you, those genes will not be passed on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The principle of sexual selection. We’re not demonstrating it rock solid here, but if I had to give a cause for these findings – based in part on a lot of sociological research – sexual selection is the most obvious explanation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rewriting textbooks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research clearly shows that recessive carriers of diseases have a selection disadvantage at the group level. In the past, this has been pointed out for specific disorders. Here, for the first time this is demonstrated for recessive disorders in general. That may go into the textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brunner: “Our research indicates that our genes are still constantly changing, that the genetic landscape remains in motion, that evolution continues. The idea that in our modern age evolution has come to a creaking halt thanks to health care and other amenities is not true.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor will it ever be, Gilissen suggests: “We will never be optimized for tomorrow’s problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this evolutionary neuroscience and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7f0f161a0b1a0d511310121e110c3f0d1e1b1d100a1b0a121c511113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pieter Lomans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://radboudumc.nl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Radboud University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Pieter Lomans – Radboud University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-025-02204-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Reproductive and cognitive phenotypes in carriers of recessive pathogenic variants&lt;/a&gt;” by Christian Gilissen et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reproductive and cognitive phenotypes in carriers of recessive pathogenic variants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic landscape of human Mendelian diseases is shaped by mutation and selection. Although selection on heterozygotes is well-established in autosomal-dominant disorders, convincing evidence for selection in carriers of pathogenic variants associated with recessive conditions is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we studied heterozygous pathogenic variants in 1,929 genes, which cause recessive diseases when bi-allelic, in &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 378,751 unrelated European individuals from the UK Biobank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We find evidence suggesting fitness effects in heterozygous carriers for recessive genes, especially for variants in constrained genes across a broad range of diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data suggest reproductive effects at the population level, and hence natural selection, for autosomal-recessive disease variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, variants in genes that underlie intellectual disability are associated with lower educational attainment in carriers, and we observe an altered genetic landscape, characterized by a threefold reduction in the calculated frequency of bi-allelic intellectual disability in the population relative to other recessive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 21:18:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxOdFJrdE9Sc0w1dlZVZTFwZTVGQlJYRW13ZVhUSk9UR093TWR5QmpDZlUyRFYtRU5MeDhPdkJ2eVQwN3ZDaVloZ0tFdFdjN0NUcDM1eUpTVmtZa3JSbWlXa19tdjEzZk5IaVg2TUx0TV9sc2FFSGFPS19ZaTlYZlhVaA</guid></item><item><title>沉默三天后，您的大脑化学物质会发生变化-男孩天才报告 | Your brain chemistry changes after just three days of silence - Boy Genius Report</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQUHNsR1FxMWhvdU01U0VuQmpFNXRGQnJWOXZFbDZWNTZLMWVLUjktdVVORWhBNFhoZFVieXpQaFAtbDg2YlRrV1l4ZmlEV3VKS253c1lfSm8yNGpZUnhBSV96NmVPcFRDbHZzS3kzSDNmajJmVldpWVJNN0w0RUkxSjRlOEtUbXREWUlvTWlnQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content no-dropcap"&gt;
								
&lt;p&gt;We tend to think of silence as empty space. The absence of sound. But, it turns out that quiet isn’t passive at all. In fact, after just three days of intentional silence, the brain begins to physically and functionally rewire itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.98.2.676"&gt;growing body of neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; shows that &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4087081/"&gt;silence can spark changes in the brain&lt;/a&gt; comparable to months of meditation, cognitive training, or rigorous exercise. These changes don’t take long to show up, either. They begin after about 72 hours of cumulative quiet.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://techfixated.com/the-shocking-ways-your-brain-changes-after-just-3-days-of-silence/"&gt;most surprising discoveries&lt;/a&gt; centers on the hippocampus, the part of the brain that governs memory. Scientists found that after three days of sustained silence, participants showed measurable growth of new brain cells in this region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of neurogenesis was previously thought to require long-term interventions. But, for people regularly exposed to noise, the effect was even more dramatic, suggesting those most stressed by sound may benefit the most from the changes silence drives in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bgr-newsletter-signup-form newsletter-signup-form black-bg"&gt;	&lt;h4&gt;Tech.

People shift from fast, high-alert beta waves to slower alpha and theta waves associated with calm focus and creativity. By the third day, participants were reaching these states more quickly, within minutes instead of hours. These same patterns are typically linked to deep meditation or states of flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emotional benefits are just as striking. After a few days of silence, the brain’s emotional centers change to communicate more efficiently. People become better at noticing early signs of emotional stress and responding to them with more clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in silent retreats reported steadier moods, fewer overreactions, and increased resilience. Remarkably, these effects lasted for weeks after the silent period ended. With the brain no longer busy processing constant sound, other senses grow sharper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People demonstrated better vision, taste, smell, and touch, confirmed by standardized testing. This sensory sharpening stems from the brain reallocating resources, a process known as cross-modal plasticity. It’s one reason silence may be especially helpful for those in high-performance sensory fields like culinary arts or design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive performance also improves. Working memory, the ability to hold and manage information in the moment, saw consistent gains. People recalled details more easily, solved problems faster, and made fewer mental errors after just a few days of silence. These advantages appeared across a wide range of individuals, from professionals to retirees, signifying major changes in the brain.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silence may even help protect the brain over time. Long-term studies found that regular quiet periods could slow age-related decline and reduce stress-related damage to the brain. In clinical trials with older adults, structured silence improved memory, lowered anxiety, and delayed the progression of cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to go on a remote retreat to experience these benefits. About two hours of accumulated quiet a day—spaced throughout mornings, breaks, and evenings—is enough to produce measurable effects, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting the day without screens, taking a short walk without earbuds, or carving out ten minutes between tasks can all add up. We’re still working to understand how the brain changes, and we just found out&lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/the-brain-doesnt-learn-how-we-thought-it-does-new-study-reveals/"&gt; the brain doesn’t learn how we thought &lt;/a&gt;But this breakthrough takes us one step closer to fully understanding the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world filled with endless distractions and digital noise, silence may be one of the most powerful and overlooked tools for mental clarity and long-term brain health. Quiet time, it turns out, isn’t just a luxury. It’s a neurological necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/high-protein-breakfasts-without-eggs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Protein&lt;/a&gt; gets all the credit, and for good reason. We know that starting our day off with an ample amount of protein (around 20-30 grams) is essential for maintaining our hormone health, preventing mid-morning energy crashes, and keeping us full for longer. One might say &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/what-happens-when-you-eat-protein/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;protein really is &lt;em&gt;that girl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But I would like to make a case for another, equally important nutrient to kickstart your mornings—fiber. Dietary fiber is a non-digestible carbohydrate that can be found in plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole grains. Both soluble and insoluble fiber play important roles in &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/fiber/art-20043983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;overall health&lt;/a&gt;, and consuming enough fiber regularly has been shown to lower cholesterol, promote a healthy GI tract (by ensuring you’re staying regular), improve blood sugar, and help reduce inflammation, to name a few &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/benefits-of-fiber/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;	




&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this vital nutrient is often &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/dietician-nutrition-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;overlooked&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10498976/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;19 out of 20 Americans&lt;/a&gt; do not consume the minimum recommended amount of fiber each day. According to the National Academy of Medicine, women under age 50 should aim to consume &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/fiber/art-20043983#:~:text=How%20much%20fiber%20do%20you,women%20age%2050%20or%20younger." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;25 grams of fiber per day&lt;/a&gt;. This means choosing high-fiber foods (5-10 grams) at each meal can help you reach your daily goal. (A gentle reminder that if you don’t regularly consume large amounts of fiber, to take it slow and make sure you are staying hydrated to prevent unwanted gas and bloating.) The good news is that dietary fiber is not difficult to incorporate into your favorite &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/how-breakfast-can-change-eating-habits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;breakfast&lt;/a&gt; go-tos, plus by prioritizing fiber first thing in the morning, you can ensure that you are reaping the health benefits all day long. Keep reading for high-fiber breakfasts you can make today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to high-fiber breakfasts, oatmeal gets all the buzz. Oats contain a prebiotic fiber called beta-glucan, which is known to feed the good bacteria living in your gut. This recipe contains a few different fiber sources—peanut butter, banana, and oats—for a well-rounded breakfast option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-2.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526746"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/healthy-sweet-potato-black-bean-avocado-breakfast-burritos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ambitious Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beans are a great way to include both plant-based protein and fiber in your diet. One cup of black beans contains 15 grams of fiber—we love to see it! The great thing about breakfast burritos is that you can customize them to your liking. Follow this recipe with sweet potatoes and avocado, or consider using white beans with tomatoes and feta for Mediterranean-inspired flavors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-chia-seed-pudding"&gt;3. Chia Seed Pudding&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-3.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526747"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://www.loveandlemons.com/chia-seed-pudding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Love &amp;amp; Lemons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds pack 10 grams of fiber in 2 tablespoons, making chia seed pudding a great option to keep things moving (if you know what I mean). I love making a big batch of chia seed pudding at the beginning of the week so I have it on hand when rushing out the door in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-honey-lemon-ricotta-breakfast-toast-with-figs-and-pistachios"&gt;4. Honey Lemon Ricotta Breakfast Toast with Figs and Pistachios&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-4.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526748"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/honey-lemon-ricotta-breakfast-toast-with-figs-pistachios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ambitious Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For this decadent toast situation, choosing a whole grain bread (look for whole wheat as the first ingredient) will help up the fiber. The combination of figs and pistachios offers additional health benefits, as figs are an antioxidant and pistachios provide heart-healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-zucchini-oatmeal-breakfast-cookies"&gt;5. Zucchini Oatmeal Breakfast Cookies&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-5.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526749"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://livelytable.com/zucchini-oatmeal-breakfast-cookies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Lively Table&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I mean, who doesn’t want dessert for breakfast? Not only do these breakfast cookies contain fiber from the oats and zucchini, but they are also made with &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/benefits-of-flaxseeds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;flaxseed,&lt;/a&gt; an ingredient known to help aid in disease prevention and promote better digestion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-sauteed-breakfast-salad"&gt;6. Sauteed Breakfast Salad&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-6.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526750"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/sauteed-breakfast-salad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Eating Bird Food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When I saw this breakfast salad recipe, I honestly wondered why I hadn’t thought of this for myself. I mean, a cobb salad (bacon, eggs) basically is breakfast if you really think about it. Pack in your micronutrients and fiber from the greens and top with your typical breakfast favorites.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-cinnamon-quinoa-breakfast-bowl"&gt;7. Cinnamon Quinoa Breakfast Bowl&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-7.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526751"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/cinnamon-quinoa-breakfast-bowl/#wprm-recipe-container-34219" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Eating Bird Food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to grains, you don’t have to stick to only oatmeal to get your fiber in at breakfast. Quinoa is a great base because you can make it sweet, like this recipe here, or go a more savory route with eggs, greens, and cheese.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-sweet-potato-toast"&gt;8. Sweet Potato Toast&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-8.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526752"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/sweet-potato-toast/#wprm-recipe-container-7048" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Feel Good Foodie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it’s a little dated, but will sweet potato toast really ever go out of style? I’m certainly not against bread, but if you want to incorporate both more fiber and vegetables throughout your day, sweet potato toast is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-9-creamy-clementine-smoothie"&gt;9. Creamy Clementine Smoothie&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-9.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526753"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/creamy-clementine-smoothie/#wprm-recipe-container-33463" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Eating Bird Food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Smoothies are an easy way to pack in fiber with various fruits, greens, and seeds. This recipe offers the antioxidant benefits of vitamin C found in the clementines while also utilizing protein powder for a filling breakfast option.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-10-shakshuka"&gt;10. Shakshuka&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-10.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526754"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://www.loveandlemons.com/shakshuka-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Love &amp;amp; Lemons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shakshuka is a popular Northern African and Middle Eastern dish prepared with poached eggs in a tomato sauce flavored with spices. This recipe is a great way to start your day with a variety of veggies, and you can up the fiber by pairing it with whole wheat pita or bread.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that GBM patients taking gabapentin lived several months longer than those who did not, across two independent hospital datasets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings stem from insights into how brain tumors exploit neural signaling, with gabapentin potentially disrupting this interaction by lowering levels of a key protein, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). While promising, the study is retrospective and calls for randomized trials to validate gabapentin as a therapeutic option for GBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Survival Benefit:&lt;/strong&gt; GBM patients on gabapentin survived 4–6 months longer on average.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological Marker:&lt;/strong&gt; Gabapentin use was linked to lower serum TSP-1, a tumor-promoting protein.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broad Dataset:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings were replicated in over 1,000 patients across two medical centers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Mass General&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study by investigators from Mass General Brigham suggests that gabapentin, a relatively common anti-seizure/pain medication, is linked to improved survival in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) — the most common and deadly form of brain cancer in adults. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications, &lt;/em&gt;are based on a retrospective analysis and add new evidence to help patients with this devastating disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109987"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a head and brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Many of the patients were already taking gabapentin for reasons that typically centered on nerve pain. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study is an exciting step forward,” said lead author Joshua Bernstock, MD, PhD, a clinical fellow in the Department of Neurosurgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“GBM is a relentlessly progressive and nearly universally fatal disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The discovery that an already approved medication with a favorable safety profile can extend overall survival represents a meaningful and potentially practice-changing advance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GBM is a highly aggressive and deadly form of brain cancer. With about 12,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the United States, GBM accounts for most primary brain tumors in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall survival has barely improved over the last several decades, with most patients living only 12 to 14 months after diagnosis and 5.5 months after recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study was sparked by insight from the field of cancer neuroscience. This research area focuses on how tumors manipulate neural signaling to fuel their growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; identified thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1)—a protein involved in neural circuit development and remodeling—as a key mediator of interactions between neurons and tumor cells that promote glioma growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mouse models, this neuron–tumor axis was successfully targeted using gabapentin, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intrigued by this research, Bernstock and colleagues analyzed the outcomes of 693 GBM patients at Mass General Brigham. Many of the patients were already taking gabapentin for reasons that typically centered on nerve pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who were taking the drug survived an average of 16 months compared to 12 months for those who weren’t. This four-month survival benefit was statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the results seemed “almost too good to be true,” according to Bernstock, he connected with Dr. Shawn Hervey-Jumper’s team at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) to add to the dataset and discovered they were able to replicate what was found at Mass General Brigham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 379 patients with newly diagnosed GBM included in the UCSF cohort, patients on gabapentin survived an average of 20.8 months, while those not taking gabapentin survived an average of 14.7 months. Together, the data included 1,072 patients and found a significant survival benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that patients treated with gabapentin had lower levels of serum TSP-1, suggesting that the protein may serve as an indicator of treatment response. However, the relationship between TSP-1 levels and gabapentin needs further investigation, Bernstock said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have been very few advances in survival for GBM patients since the early 2000s,” Bernstock said. “We need to think more creatively about the emerging biology in these tumors and how to target them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings are promising, the study is retrospective — the researchers didn’t give patients gabapentin in a controlled way to test its effects. Bernstock stressed that larger, randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the results and explore the role of gabapentin and TSP-1 in GBM progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this brain cancer and neuropharmacology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#583d352d2a28302118353f3a76372a3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Liz Murphy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mgb.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mass General&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Liz Murphy – Mass General&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59614-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gabapentinoids confer survival benefit in human glioblastoma&lt;/a&gt;” by Joshua Bernstock et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabapentinoids confer survival benefit in human glioblastoma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuronal-glioma interactions are increasingly recognized as critical in the development and progression of central nervous system tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research highlights that gliomas can integrate into neural circuits through various mechanisms, including the synaptogenic factor thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new mechanistic understanding of cancer neuroscience allows for novel insights into target discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critically, therapies that modulate neuron-tumor interactions remain agnostic to other oncogenic changes within tumor cells yet may still target fundamental drivers of tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In line with these findings and controlling for critical confounding variables, we demonstrate a survival benefit associated with gabapentin (an antagonist of TSP-1) following surgical resection of newly diagnosed glioblastoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This retrospective, multi-institutional cohort study included 1,072 patients, with a discovery cohort of 693 patients and an additional 379 patients from a separate site for external validation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, our findings indicate that gabapentin administration is associated with reduced serum TSP-1 levels, suggesting its potential as a future biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 20:25:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBCNHNtNkNhNTdEeG9XNklXdlVMSF9sWmJRRjBBM3ZPT0lVNnNIT1ZoenZpZ052REZHT25pVFN0OUxsTkxid3RJR08zeGljdHZ4ZEtiRTdXa2g4eDI3ZTdjd2wxZHdvb3dvcXY4UlRMYXIxakM4</guid></item><item><title>医生通过首个个性化基因编辑疗法Engadget成功治疗婴儿 | Doctors successfully treated a baby with the first ever personalized gene-editing therapy - Engadget</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0wFBVV95cUxPRzk5S0VWdVFHNGtEbk01S0QzME16bjhhSUJmbGszNmcyU0t3MS1lcUc0emhwYTFTS0ZnMVZrZGQ4RURyS2gxYW5uUHoydVNIRW5zZk5uLW9lMnhhT1M0MWNwZmR0c0NrLVVOVFlnS0I5cWZ6clpvZkZOQU54Y2M3bXVDRm9jcDVzYm5IS2I3UG0tLWZoQ1h1T2Vva2ZkQ1ZMVTd0aW84dEp3RFM0STJvaEtBSW5NVkxUWUkwcmNRR25scXhfNUtTdzgzS2hibVBLUWNB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of doctors and scientists have successfully treated a rare genetic condition with the first-ever personalized gene-editing therapy.

The study revealed lower levels of nerve growth factor and elevated inflammatory markers in the long COVID group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite performing similarly on standard cognitive tests, these individuals reported poorer quality of life, physical and emotional health, and showed deficits in verbal fluency. These findings validate the experiences of long COVID patients and suggest biological markers could help clinicians better diagnose and treat persistent symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biomarker Imbalance:&lt;/strong&gt; Long COVID patients had lower nerve growth factor and higher IL-10, indicating impaired neuroplasticity and inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language Deficits:&lt;/strong&gt; Participants with long COVID performed worse on letter fluency tests, despite otherwise normal cognitive assessments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower Quality of Life:&lt;/strong&gt; Long COVID patients reported poorer physical, emotional, and psychological well-being than recovered individuals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Corewell Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study that is the first to compare inflammation and brain stress responses in long COVID-19 patients with individuals who have fully recovered shows that those with continued brain fog and other cognitive issues have a lower ability to adapt to stress and higher levels of inflammation in their brains. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While previous long COVID studies have shown changes in these markers in mice, this study evaluated the infection’s impact on the brain in documented COVID-positive patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109983"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a head and red fog." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;According to the study authors, the struggle physicians have with evaluating long COVID patients is that when asked to complete various written diagnostic tests, they tend to look normal. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until now, physicians have found it difficult to understand why certain patients develop post-COVID cognitive symptoms while others do not. Recent studies estimate tens of millions of people worldwide still have not recovered from the COVID infection, even five years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We compared our long COVID participants to our healthy, fully recovered control group based on neurocognitive measures, emotional functioning, measures of quality of life as well as specific changes in blood markers assessing stress response,” said lead author Michael Lawrence, Ph.D., neuropsychologist at Corewell Health in Grand Rapids, Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To our knowledge, this is the first controlled study that shows specific self-reported neurocognitive and central nervous systems changes in long COVID patients which validates the symptoms they’ve been experiencing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pilot study, published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;, included 17 confirmed COVID patients (10 with long COVID and seven who were fully recovered with no lingering symptoms) and found the following:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Serum levels of nerve growth factor, a biomarker of the brain’s ability to change and adapt by forming new connections, were significantly lower in the long COVID group. This group was also more likely to have higher serum levels of interleukin (IL)-10, a marker of inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While there was virtually no difference between groups related to neuropsychological test outcomes, long COVID participants did score significantly lower on letter fluency, meaning they had more difficulty with quickly and accurately accessing language centers in the brain and producing words beginning with various letters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The long COVID group also had significantly lower ratings than healthy controls on quality of life, physical health, emotional functioning and psychological well-being responses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although this is a small study and more work needs to be done, from a clinical application standpoint, physicians potentially can identify individuals who are struggling sooner and provide wrap-around care that could be helpful to them,” said Judith Arnetz, Ph.D., professor emerita at Michigan State University College of Human Medicine and corresponding author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study authors, the struggle physicians have with evaluating long COVID patients is that when asked to complete various written diagnostic tests, they tend to look normal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These patients experience significant frustration, and their symptoms often may be minimized by friends, family and even the medical community,” Dr. Lawrence said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s tough when everything looks normal on paper, but our patients continue to struggle and report a multitude of difficulties.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Arnetz agreed and indicated that physicians might want to take a multidisciplinary approach to care and assess inflammatory and brain biomarkers, which could ultimately offer a better path forward in treating patients with long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additional services such as speech therapy, psychotherapy for stress reduction and incorporating medications that target fatigue and mental fogginess could all be elements of creating a successful treatment plan as well,” Dr. Lawrence said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this long COVID and neurology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6d1e0c1f04030c430a01080c1e02032d0e021f081a08010105080c01190543021f0a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sarina Gleason&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://corewellhealth.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Corewell Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sarina Gleason – Corewell Health&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

in &lt;em&gt;Emerging Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt;, describes a 58-year-old woman who, an estimated 48 years after treatment with cadaver-derived human growth hormone, died of iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (iCJD), a prion disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient, who sought care after developing gait imbalance and tremors 2 weeks earlier, had received prion-contaminated cadaveric human growth hormone (chGH) for 9.3 years starting at age 7. Prion diseases, which affect both humans and animals, are fatal neurologic conditions caused by infectious misfolded proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;chGH is a well-described iatrogenic (healthcare-related) cause of this type of CJD. The National Hormone Pituitary Program (NHPP) administered the drug to treat growth failure to roughly 7,700 US patients from the 1960s through the 1980s, the researchers noted.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;An outbreak of chGH-related iCJD, first recognized in the United States in 1985, prompted the immediate shutdown of chGH production and NHPP administration of the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after, chGH was replaced with recombinant (biosynthetic) human growth hormone, but the iCJD outbreak continued due to the often-long latency period in some previous chGH recipients. Latency periods for prion diseases are variable and depend on factors such as the infectious particle dose (higher doses are linked to shorter latency); route of infection (central nervous system [CNS] exposures are tied to shorter latency than peripheral ones); and recipient genetics, particularly the codon 129 polymorphism in the &lt;em&gt;PRNP&lt;/em&gt; gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;iCJD is more of a public health concern than the other two CJD types—sporadic and genetic—because of its potential to cause outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rapid clinical deterioration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This patient was the 36th iCJD case among US NHPP chGH recipients and the 254th such case worldwide as of January 2024.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When she presented for treatment, her medical history included depression, cervical spine fusion, and idiopathic panhypopituitarism, a condition that occurs when the pituitary gland doesn't produce all or most of its hormones, but it isn't clear why. The initial neurologic exam showed frequent lateral movements of the head and trunk, as well as irregular hand movements that went away with distraction, but the exam was otherwise unremarkable. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and cervical spine revealed no pathology. Results of the Mayo Clinic Autoimmune Movement Disorders Panel and HIV screening were negative, and copper, vitamin E, and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; levels were within normal ranges. The patient was referred to the movement disorders clinic and advised to start physical therapy and continue psychologic treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-right"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the next month, the patient developed urinary incontinence, worsening tremors, decreased speech, and abnormal gait. She returned to the hospital with tachypnea (abnormally fast breathing), hyperekplexia (exaggerated startle reflex with intense muscle stiffness), and appendicular rigidity (stiffness in the arms and legs). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Her breathing and alertness quickly declined, and she was intubated. In the next several days, she developed both stimulus-induced and spontaneous myoclonus (a neurologic condition featuring sudden, involuntary muscle jerks or twitches), and she remained in a coma.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Positive prion assay, death&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A repeat brain MRI 2 months after the initial exam revealed lesions, and continuous electroencephalography showed frequent 1- to 2.5-Hertz generalized periodic discharges of 3 to 9 seconds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The woman's antinuclear antibody level was mildly positive, but all other serum test results, including for autoantibodies, generated no pathologic findings. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral and autoantibody test results were negative. Oligoclonal bands (proteins in the CSF that can indicate CNS inflammation or damage) were absent. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prion testing at the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center (NPDPSC) at Case Western Reserve University showed substantially elevated total tau (protein that forms tangles in the brain) and a very high concentration of 14-3-3 protein. A real-time quaking-induced conversion assay was positive for prions. Per the patient's documented wishes, she was extubated and died.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-left"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An autopsy performed at NPDPSC confirmed CJD via Western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis of brain tissue. An examination of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;PRNP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; gene, which is involved in genetic CJD, was negative for pathogenic mutations, supporting a diagnosis of iCJD in the context of previous chGH treatment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The patient had a methionine/valine polymorphism (change in the DNA sequence that is common in a population) at codon 129 of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;PRNP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; gene, which has been tied to longer incubation periods in acquired human prion diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Difficult to estimate latency &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Determining the precise latency period for chGH-linked iCJD cases is often impossible, because patients were often exposed to chGH for many years, the researchers said. But it can be estimated using the interval from the first dose of chGH and iCJD symptom onset, the period from the midpoint of chGH treatment to iCJD symptom onset, the time between the last dose of chGH and symptom onset, and the midpoint of chGH treatment calculated from the first chGH dose to the end of 1977.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of note, none of the 36 US iCJD cases exclusively received post-1977 chGH, likely because the NHPP developed a new laboratory method to extract chGH from pituitary glands in 1977.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The reason for considering that method of calculation involves the epidemiology of the US outbreak, which suggests that the most likely source of iCJD infection came from chGH administered before or during 1977, even though most of the ≈7,700 NHPP recipients started chGH treatment after 1977," the authors wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Of note, none of the 36 US iCJD cases exclusively received post-1977 chGH, likely because the NHPP developed a new laboratory method to extract chGH from pituitary glands in 1977," they added. "That method included column purification to separate and collect multiple hormones from the glands, a procedure now known to have greatly reduced prion contamination."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;New outbreak cases still possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For this study, the team performed all four latency estimate calculations: "First dose of chGH to symptom onset was 51.3 years, midpoint of chGH treatment to symptom onset was 46.7 years, last dose of chGH to symptom onset was 42.1 years, and midpoint of pre-1978 chGH to symptom onset was 48.3 years. We compared our patient’s latency estimate calculation to all US chGH-associated iCJD cases, and given the evidence implicating pre-1978 chGH, we considered the final method to provide the most accurate estimate of 48.3 years latency."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clinicians should recognize the continued possibility of chGH-associated CJD cases and include iCJD in the differential diagnosis for anyone with new neurologic symptoms and prior chGH exposure, particularly patients exposed to chGH before the 1977 updated purification process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The estimated latency of the ongoing US chGH-related iCJD outbreak was 10 years, compared with 5 years among the first 226 cases reported internationally, which the authors said suggests a lower level of prion contamination in US NHPP-distributed chGH. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Also, experimental transmission studies in nonhuman primates using samples of all 76 lots of chGH retained at the US NHPP demonstrated that prion contamination was rare and random. "That low level of contamination, the purification step introduced in the United States in 1977, and the peripheral route of administration created an environment that would be expected to result in longer latency periods," the investigators noted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the US iCJD outbreak has slowed considerably, new cases are still possible, particularly among chGH recipients who are heterozygous M/V at codon 129 of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;PRNP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; gene. "Clinicians should recognize the continued possibility of chGH-associated CJD cases and include iCJD in the differential diagnosis for anyone with new neurologic symptoms and prior chGH exposure, particularly patients exposed to chGH before the 1977 updated purification process," they concluded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This is the process where cells break down glucose to produce energy, which cancer cells use to grow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While taurine is naturally produced in the human body and found in foods such as meat and fish, it is also added to many energy drinks for its purported benefits, such as improving mental performance and reducing inflammation. It has also been used to alleviate chemotherapy side effects in leukemia patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the study suggests that the excessive intake of taurine, particularly through supplements and energy drinks, could exacerbate leukemia by providing additional fuel for cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 dcjixd"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/15/16/16/drinks.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/15/16/16/drinks.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/15/16/16/drinks.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A new study warns energy drink consumers about excessive amounts of taurine, which is naturally produced by the body but excessive amounts can increase the risk of blood cancer." class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-30507"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;A new study warns energy drink consumers about excessive amounts of taurine, which is naturally produced by the body but excessive amounts can increase the risk of blood cancer.&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study looked at mice with a special gene called SLC6A6, which helps move taurine around the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists also gave these mice human leukemia cells to see how they would react. They discovered that healthy bone marrow cells produce taurine, which the SLC6A6 gene then transports to the leukemia cells, potentially helping them grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized the need to weigh the risks and benefits of extra taurine for leukemia patients and energy drink consumers, given its widespread availability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 KoUqb"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/15/16/46/GettyImages-1470897519.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/15/16/46/GettyImages-1470897519.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/15/16/46/GettyImages-1470897519.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The study examined mice with the SLC6A6 gene, which is responsible for transporting taurine throughout the body." class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-30508"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;The study examined mice with the SLC6A6 gene, which is responsible for transporting taurine throughout the body.&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Getty Images for CELSIUS Energy)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study is still early, researchers are hopeful that blocking taurine in leukemia cells could lead to new treatment options.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people may only experience shortness of breath and fatigue, while others may only experience brain fog and difficulty concentrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of this, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-9779497/Blood-test-spot-long-Covid-ready-SIX-MONTHS.html" class=""&gt;diagnosing long Covid&lt;/a&gt; is challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the journal PLOS One, looked at 17 patients aged 25 to 60 who were previously infected with Covid at least six months prior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants included 10 people diagnosed with Long Covid and seven who healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All but one patient were female, and the average age was 42. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants completed interviews about their lingering symptoms, which could have included brain fog, memory issues, fatigue, anxiety or depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also performed cognitive tests to evaluate processing speed, language, learning and memory, problem solving, multitasking and concentration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also drew blood samples from each participant to test elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts found Long Covid patients had 33 percent lower levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) in their brains, a protein that helps maintain neurons in the brain and central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Low NGF levels have been associated with neurocognitive conditions like Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long Covid patients also had 50 percent more interleukin 10, a protein that helps regulate inflammation and immune responses in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though interleukin 10 normally controls inflammation, high levels can have the opposite effect and create more inflammation in the central nervous system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nine in 10 participants in the Long Covid group had elevated inflammatory markers like interleukin 10 compared to one of out the seven healthy controls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, Long Covid patients scored 30 percent lower on tests of language processing, suggesting Long Covid triggers inflammation in the brain's language centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also found Long Covid patients were 75 percent more likely than healthy patients to suffer a worsened quality of life overall. They also had a 61 percent increased risk of suffering general pain or discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Alison Cohen, an epidemiologist and long Covid researcher at the University of California San Francisco, never imagined Long Covid would upend her life.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="story_dl"&gt;St. PAUL, Minn., May 15 (UPI) --&lt;/span&gt; Millions of "long COVID" patients coping with debilitating "brain fog" and chronic fatigue, who are looking for answers to what's at the root of their illness, received a hopeful sign through a new study released Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers, though somewhat complex, appear to be biological and neurological, authors of the study said. In other words, it's not just in patients' heads.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An estimated 12 million COVID "long-haulers" in the United States experience a range of neurological symptoms such as feeling slow, having difficulty thinking or concentrating, confusion and forgetfulness many months after recovery from the viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sufferers have reported up to 200 different symptoms, both mental and physical, the most common of which include brain fog, lingering fatigue and shortness of breath.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neurological symptoms, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/how-to-manage-long-covid-brain-fog" target="_blank"&gt;can limit&lt;/a&gt; those who once exceled at sophisticated mental "multitasking" to doing just one thing at a time, making them far less able to handle stress or tap the mental flexibility needed for their jobs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since long COVID first emerged as a recognized syndrome, the hunt has been on to find a "biological mechanism" at the root of the malady. Those efforts got a boost this week with the publication of a small-scale study showing altered levels of a pair of key brain chemicals in patients who complained of symptoms six months after infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Corewell Health in Grand Rapids, Mich., and Michigan State University said their findings provide more evidence that a biological mechanism is indeed at the root of the cognitive impairments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is the first to directly measure inflammation in long COVID patients and bolsters theories that the pernicious brain fog and fatigue are not just mental issues, but linked to a biological cause that can be objectively assessed, the authors say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6% of American adults &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7350a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; they were experiencing long COVID symptoms in 2023, translating to nearly 25 million people. Of those, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2797782" target="_blank"&gt;about half&lt;/a&gt; have complained of brain fog -- and at those levels the need to understand and develop health strategies for them is tremendous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0315486" target="_blank"&gt;The Michigan study&lt;/a&gt;, published in multidisciplinary journal PLOS One, looked for telltale biomarkers and to assess cognition in patients who have been very "conservatively" defined as having long COVID -- that is, those who were still experiencing brain fog six months after initial infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the authors said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They looked at a total of 17 people with confirmed COVID diagnoses, including 10 who were still reporting long COVID symptoms and a control group of seven others who had recovered without any long-lasting symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found that those with the symptoms had lower serum levels of nerve growth factor, or NGF, a protein that plays a key role in neuron development and maintenance of the brain's plasticity. NGF is associated with high-level cognitive functions that require memory and mental flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those same subjects also had higher levels of interleukin-10, a powerful anti-inflammatory protein secreted by white blood cells that plays a crucial role in regulating the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the group also showed declines in "letter fluency," a neurological cognition test meant to measure how quickly subjects can perform "executive function" mental tasks requiring working memory and attention to detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to study co-author Dr. Bengt Arnetz, a professor of family and preventive medicine and former chairman of Michigan State University's Department of Family Medicine Clinical Center, the combination of these biological and neurological differences in long COVID sufferers is significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found biological changes, which I think it's very big strength for this study," he told reporters during a virtual press conference earlier this week. "In parallel with the effects on executive function, we also saw that [NGF], which reflects the brain's ability to adapt to grow new neurons and connection, was suppressed in long COVID. This is aligned with the findings in the neuro-cognitive test.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"And that's a very novel finding. No one has really looked at that before [among patients] with proven COVID cases who have recovered from the infection."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-author Michael Lawrence, a clinical neuropsychologist with Corewell Health in Grand Rapids, said the long COVID sufferers underwent a battery of psychological exams to assess what effects the condition has had on their mental acuity. He found that, generally speaking, they "look normal on neurocognitive testing" -- except for one measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Out of the multitude of tests that we gave, only one test seemed to show group differences, and that test is a test of what we call letter fluency. It measures executive functioning, but executive functioning under time constraints," he told UPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long COVID patients come to his practice complaining of challenges relating to fatigue, brain fog and being "ineffective and inefficient," he said, but they are continually frustrated and often feel "invalidated" by the medical community because there was no known biological reason for their complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study results suggest "it's this processing speed-related issue that we think is somewhat related to COVID 'fog,' but also somewhat different, outside of the cognitive domain" -- thus likely pointing to a biological cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deficit of interleukin-10, "given that it's an energy production protein... I think there is a relationship there," Lawrence said. "And I think it's helpful, because now we have some objective findings that really confirm what patients are describing and feeling."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study provides hope that "if we can identify these individuals early with biomarkers, then we can develop multidisciplinary treatment to focus on all aspects of the individual," he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think patients and our medical community, at least years ago, tended to separate the mental health from the physical. But what we know is they're all very interconnected. The more we can improve mental health-related symptoms, what we see is decreased reports of pain and fatigue. We really need to treat the whole person, but we need to treat it early."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future researchers "can look at these biomarkers over time to see what treatments tend to affect or change these serum levels," Lawrence said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span class="tag-term"&gt;News Release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2025-05-15T13:30:00-04:00" class="date-display-single"&gt;Thursday, May 15, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Infant with rare, incurable disease is first to successfully receive personalized gene therapy treatment&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;
NIH-supported gene-editing platform lays groundwork to rapidly develop treatments for other rare genetic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research team supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed and safely delivered a personalized gene editing therapy to treat an infant with a life-threatening, incurable genetic disease. The infant, who was diagnosed with the rare condition carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency shortly after birth, has responded positively to the treatment. The process, from diagnosis to treatment, took only six months and marks the first time the technology has been successfully deployed to treat a human patient. The technology used in this study was developed using a platform that could be tweaked to treat a wide range of genetic disorders and opens the possibility of creating personalized treatments in other parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) developed the customized therapy using the gene-editing platform &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-turning-discovery-into-health/transformative-technologies/crispr-revolution"&gt;CRISPR&lt;/a&gt;. They corrected a specific gene mutation in the baby’s liver cells that led to the disorder. CRISPR is an advanced gene editing technology that enables precise changes to DNA inside living cells. This is the first known case of a personalized CRISPR-based medicine administered to a single patient and was carefully designed to target non-reproductive cells so changes would only affect the patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As a platform, gene editing -- built on reusable components and rapid customization -- promises a new era of precision medicine for hundreds of rare diseases, bringing life-changing therapies to patients when timing matters most: Early, fast, and tailored to the individual,” said Joni L. Rutter, Ph.D., director of NIH’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CPS1 deficiency is characterized by an inability to fully break down byproducts from protein metabolism in the liver, causing ammonia to build up to toxic levels in the body. It can cause severe damage to the brain and liver. Treatment includes a low protein diet until the child is old enough for a liver transplant. However, in this waiting period there is a risk of rapid organ failure due to stressors such as infection, trauma, or dehydration. High levels of ammonia can cause coma, brain swelling, and may be fatal or cause permanent brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The child initially received a very low dose of the therapy at six months of age, then a higher dose later. The research team saw signs that the therapy was effective almost from the start. The six-month old began taking in more protein in the diet, and the care team could reduce the medicine needed to keep ammonia levels low in the body. Another telling sign of the child’s improvement to date came after the child caught a cold, and later, had to deal with a gastrointestinal illness. Normally, such infections for a child in this condition could be extremely dangerous, especially with the possibility of ammonia reaching dangerous levels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We knew the method used to deliver the gene-editing machinery to the baby’s liver cells allowed us to give the treatment repeatedly. That meant we could start with a low dose that we were sure was safe,” said CHOP pediatrician Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were very concerned when the baby got sick, but the baby just shrugged the illness off,” said Penn geneticist and first author Kiran Musunuru, M.D., Ph.D. For now, much work remains, but the researchers are cautiously optimistic about the baby’s progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists announced their work at the American Society of Gene &amp;amp; Cell Therapy Meeting on May 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and described the study in &lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Yale-led study shows that the senses stimulate a region of the brain that controls consciousness—a finding that might inform treatment for disorders related to attention, arousal, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Humans perceive and navigate the world around us with the help of our five senses: sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell. And while scientists have long known that these different senses activate different parts of the brain, a new Yale-led study indicates that multiple senses all stimulate a critical region deep in the brain that controls consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811925002277" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/i&gt;, sheds new light on how &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sensory+perception/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sensory perception&lt;/a&gt; works in the brain and may fuel the development of therapies to treat disorders involving attention, arousal, and consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, a research team led by Yale's Aya Khalaf focused on the workings of subcortical arousal systems, brain structure networks that play a crucial role in regulating sleep-wake states. Previous studies on patients with disorders of consciousness—such as coma or epilepsy—have confirmed the influence of these systems on states of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But prior research has been largely limited to tracking individual senses. For the new study, researchers asked if stimuli from multiple senses share the same subcortical arousal networks. They also looked at how shifts in a subject's attention might affect these networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed fMRI (&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/functional+magnetic+resonance+imaging/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;functional magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt;) datasets collected from 1,561 healthy adult participants as they performed 11 different tasks using four senses: vision, audition, taste, and touch.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;They made two important discoveries: that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sensory+input/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sensory input&lt;/a&gt; does make use of shared subcortical systems and, more surprisingly, that all input—regardless of which sense delivered the signal—stimulates activity in two deep brain regions, the midbrain reticular formation and the central thalamus, when a subject is sharply focused on the senses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to stimulating the critical central brain regions, they found, were the sudden shifts in attention demanded by the tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We were expecting to find activity on shared networks, but when we saw all the senses light up the same central brain regions while a test subject was focusing, it was really astonishing," said Khalaf, a postdoctoral associate in neurology at Yale School of Medicine and lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery highlighted how key these central brain regions are in regulating not only disorders of consciousness, but also conditions that impact attention and focus, such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/attention/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;attention&lt;/a&gt; deficit hyperactivity disorder. This finding could lead to better targeted medications and brain stimulation techniques for patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This has also given us insights into how things work normally in the brain," said senior author Hal Blumenfeld, the Mark Loughridge and Michele Williams Professor of Neurology who is also a professor in neuroscience and neurosurgery and director of the Yale Clinical Neuroscience Imaging Center. "It's really a step forward in our understanding of awareness and consciousness."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking across senses, this is the first time researchers have seen a result like this, said Khalaf, who is also part of Blumenfeld's lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It tells us how important this brain region is and what it could mean in efforts to restore consciousness," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;More than &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34337138/"&gt;60 million people&lt;/a&gt; are estimated to be living with dementia, resulting in over 1.5 million deaths a year and an annual cost to the global healthcare economy of around &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia"&gt;US $1.3 trillion&lt;/a&gt; (almost £1 trillion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of scientific research and billions of pounds of investment, dementia still has no cure. But what of the old saying that prevention is better than cure? Is preventing dementia possible? And if so, at what age should we be taking steps to do so?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite what many believe, dementia is not simply an unavoidable consequence of ageing or genetics. It is estimated that &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract"&gt;up to 45%&lt;/a&gt; of dementia cases could potentially be prevented by reducing exposure to 14 modifiable risk factors common throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these risk factors – which include things like obesity, lack of exercise, and smoking – are traditionally studied from middle age (around 40 to 60 years old) onwards. As a result, several of the world’s leading health bodies and dementia charities now recommend that strategies aimed at reducing dementia risk should &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-matters-midlife-approaches-to-reduce-dementia-risk/health-matters-midlife-approaches-to-reduce-dementia-risk"&gt;ideally be targeted at this age&lt;/a&gt; to reap the greatest benefits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(24)00191-0/fulltext"&gt;We argue&lt;/a&gt;, however, that targeting even younger ages is likely to provide greater benefits still. But how young are we talking? And why would exposure to risk factors many decades before the symptoms of dementia traditionally appear be important?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explain, let’s work backwards from middle age, starting with the three decades covering adolescence and young adulthood (from ten to 40 years old).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many lifestyle-related dementia risk factors emerge during the teenage years, then persist into adulthood. For example, 80% of adolescents &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26696565/"&gt;living with obesity&lt;/a&gt; will remain this way when they are adults. The same applies to &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.122.19455"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01259-9/abstract"&gt;lack of exercise&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, virtually all adults who smoke or drink will have &lt;a href="https://ash.org.uk/uploads/Youth-Smoking-Fact-Sheet.pdf?v=1741882326"&gt;started these unhealthy habits&lt;/a&gt; in or around adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This poses two potential issues when considering middle age as the best starting point for dementia-prevention strategies. First, altering health behaviour that has already been established is notoriously difficult. And second, most high-risk individuals targeted in middle age will almost certainly have been exposed to the damaging effects of these risk factors for many decades already.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, the most effective actions are likely to be those aimed at preventing unhealthy behaviour in the first place, rather than attempting to change long-established habits decades down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The roots of dementia&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about even earlier in people’s lives? Could the roots of dementia stretch as far back as childhood or infancy? &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(23)00169-9"&gt;Increasing evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests yes, and that risk factor exposures in the first decade of life (or even while in the womb) may have lifelong implications for dementia risk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand why this may be, it’s important to remember that our brain goes through three major periods during our lives – development in early life, a period of relative stability in adult life, and decline (in some functions) in old age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most dementia research understandably focuses on changes associated with that decline in later life. But there is &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.084318"&gt;increasing evidence&lt;/a&gt; that many of the differences in brain structure and function associated with dementia in older adults may have at least partly existed since childhood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in long-term studies where people have had their cognitive ability tracked across their whole lives, &lt;a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2318-7-28"&gt;one of the most important factors&lt;/a&gt; explaining someone’s cognitive ability at age 70 is their cognitive ability when they were 11. That is, older adults with poorer cognitive skills have often had these lower skills since childhood, rather than the differences being solely due to a faster decline in older age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar patterns are also seen when looking for evidence of dementia-related damage on &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(23)00169-9"&gt;brain scans&lt;/a&gt;, with some changes appearing to be more closely related to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/148/1/133/7695855"&gt;risk factor exposures in early life&lt;/a&gt; than current unhealthy lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, perhaps the time has come for dementia prevention to be thought of as a lifelong goal, rather than simply a focus for old age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A lifelong prevention plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do we achieve this in practical terms? Complex problems require complex solutions, and there is no quick fix to address this challenge. Many factors contribute to increasing or decreasing an individual’s dementia risk – there is no “one size fits all” approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one thing generally agreed upon is that mass medication of young people is not the answer. Instead, we – along with 33 other leading international researchers in the field of dementia – recently published a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(24)00191-0/fulltext"&gt;set of recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for actions that can be taken at the individual, community and national levels to improve brain health from an early age. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our consensus statement and recommendations deliver two clear messages. First, meaningful reductions in dementia risk for as many people as possible will only be achievable through a coordinated approach that brings together healthier environments, better education and smarter public policy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second – and perhaps most importantly – while it’s never too late to take steps to reduce your risk of dementia, it’s also never too early to start.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

This is the first case of a fox attack in Texas that I know of to date,' Moore told KXAN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In urban areas, if an animal is showing aggression, it can be because they are protecting a den site,' she added.

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaohyoga001e3b6dlo7aujuv@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For instance, Kristen became obsessed with two specific foods — Alfredo sauce and white chocolate — until one day she never wanted to consume either food ever again. She was also passionate about learning the flute and couldn’t get enough of practicing. But the day she finally grew tired of it, she broke her instrument so she could no longer play it at all. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaohyom0001j3b6djbaxx5l9@published" data-word-count="75"&gt;&lt;em&gt;As Kristen grew up, she overcame this behavior — and she thought she was managing adulthood well, successfully holding down a career in communications. Still, she noticed her energy evaporated after about five hours of being awake. “If I got up at 7 a.m., I’d long for my bed by noon and feel &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/i-have-zero-motivation-to-do-my-job.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;unmotivated to accomplish anything &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;on my to-do list,” Kristen says. “I also got easily worked up, stressed, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/mental-health-managing-dysregulated-nervous-system-essay.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;overstimulated&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; by small things.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaohyogg001f3b6d9dlqjxfq@published" data-word-count="94"&gt;&lt;em&gt;By 2021, she had become emotionally unavailable to her partner, Kai, whom she had known since she was 14. She no longer wanted to get out of bed at all. “One day Kai asked me, ‘When was the last time you got out of the house?’” Kristen recalls. That was the moment she realized that something was wrong. She had only been going out about once a month. “COVID was going on, but I wasn’t completely scared of getting sick. It was the production of going out. I didn’t have the battery,” she says. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaohyom4001k3b6d3go3hlab@published" data-word-count="23"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kai persuaded her to speak to a psychiatrist. Soon after, Kristen was diagnosed with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/paris-hilton-adhd-music-video.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;severe combination ADHD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/should-i-disclose-my-depression-to-my-employer.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;depression&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; disorder, and anxiety with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/ambition-work-ocd.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OCD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaohyogl001g3b6drvifd8ay@published" data-word-count="106"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It was genuinely a relief,” she says. “I felt validated that what I was feeling was not unique, and also not in my head.” She started weekly therapy and was prescribed a few medications: short-acting and extended-release methylphenidates to treat her ADHD, and bupropion and sertraline to treat her depression. This combination of treatments helped a lot. “Kai saw a spark come back into my eyes. He said that following me in conversations became a lot easier, too. He wasn’t texting me, ‘Wut? Please explain’ as much.” For the first time in her life, Kristen says she could focus and take on more without overburdening herself.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaohyoh8001i3b6deyiauwrn@published" data-word-count="60"&gt;&lt;em&gt;When Kristen was 29, she and Kai decided they were ready to have children — though she had doubts that it would happen easily. “We’d been together since we were teenagers and never had one pregnancy scare,” Kristen says. “I kind of felt like if I were able to get pregnant, I would have had at least one by then.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaohyogs001h3b6dr1euyzvj@published" data-word-count="4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what happened next. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaohu7fl00150iiad2g78rvw@published" data-word-count="53"&gt;I’ve dealt with &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/7-women-on-what-its-like-to-have-pcos.html"&gt;irregular period&lt;/a&gt;s my whole life and, as a result, have been on birth control since I was 13 or 14. Otherwise, I’d bleed heavily twice a month for seven days straight. Because I’d been on birth control for so long, I thought I might have a hard time naturally conceiving.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaosc7jv000i3b6d6ujgmjxd@published" data-word-count="65"&gt;But in 2022, after I’d been on ADHD medication and antidepressants for a year, Kai and I decided to quit &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/the-fda-approves-miudella-a-new-copper-iud.html"&gt;birth control&lt;/a&gt; and see what happened. We didn’t want to put too much pressure on ourselves, so we said that we were “not trying, but trying” to get pregnant. Since I wasn’t sure it was ever going to happen, I kept taking all my medications.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaohu7fl00170iia7jurkpbk@published" data-word-count="82"&gt;About a year after stopping birth control, I woke up with heartburn. I’ve never had heartburn in my life. I messaged my friend and she goes, “I used to get that when I was pregnant.” And I was like, “What? No way.” I realized that I’d had cramps the week before, right around the time I was supposed to get my period, and that now I was late. A few days passed, and I was finally like, “Let me take a test.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaoscjua000r3b6dhd9frnlw@published" data-word-count="126"&gt;I took a pregnancy test that morning and put it next to my desk in my home office to wait for the results. Then I checked my email and found out that I had been &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/laid-off-but-still-working.html"&gt;laid off&lt;/a&gt;. I then turned my head and saw that the pregnancy test was positive. I didn’t believe it. I convinced myself that one of my antidepressants was causing a false positive result. I’d read online how that could happen. But if there’s one thing I am good at, it’s being thorough, so I Instacarted four different pregnancy tests to my house. It was just like that scene in &lt;em&gt;Knocked Up&lt;/em&gt;. I had the digital, I had the one with little lines, I had different brands. All the results were positive.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaoscjua000s3b6djz3gzfix@published" data-word-count="78"&gt;I was like, “What the hell is happening?” It was super exciting, but I had so many emotions. Since we’d been trying for so long, I’d resigned myself to not being able to get pregnant. It was almost hard to believe that I was. Kai works in finance and called me on his way home from the office. He was like, “You’ve been silent all day. Something’s going on.” I started crying again and was like, “I’m pregnant.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaoscjua000t3b6dxue90uhy@published" data-word-count="25"&gt;He was overjoyed the moment I told him, which helped me become more excited too. But a lot of panic and stress also set in.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaohu7fl00190iiau52mimfs@published" data-word-count="60"&gt;Coincidentally, I had a psychiatrist appointment scheduled on the day I found out I was pregnant. He said I’d need to cut the dosage of one of my antidepressants in half. Kai wasn’t comfortable with me staying on the other antidepressant because he worried about an increased risk of birth defects and preterm birth, so I stopped that one completely.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaoscybm00113b6dsqpaquu2@published" data-word-count="67"&gt;As for my ADHD meds, my psychiatrist told me there wasn’t enough medical research to prove whether or not they could be passed along to the baby, so we were going to do everything by the books and stop them. We didn’t want to introduce my child to anything that could be detrimental to them in the long haul or cause withdrawal. My OB/GYN agreed with the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaoscybm00123b6d4kflxopt@published" data-word-count="33"&gt;I trusted my doctors’ judgment, but the shock of finding out I was pregnant and losing my job was also really hitting me. I couldn’t get out of bed for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaosd9sv001h3b6dksvyrp57@published" data-word-count="80"&gt;My ADHD medication gives me a little mental boost to be like, &lt;em&gt;Okay, I have clarity about my day&lt;/em&gt;, and, &lt;em&gt;I’m not gonna have all this anxiety. I know where my path forward is.&lt;/em&gt; When I stopped them, I didn’t have that anymore. The half-dose of sertraline helped stabilize my mood a little, but it was still easy for me to go deep into my thoughts and spin my wheels. You could see a lot of worry on my face.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaosdeef001p3b6dxs1urh12@published" data-word-count="61"&gt;I started looking for a new job right away, but it was hard to collect my thoughts. I would get so distracted all the time. Like, I’d say, “I’m gonna clean this room,” and then all of a sudden, it would be two in the afternoon, and I hadn’t cleaned anything because I got distracted looking at items in a box.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaosdt1100243b6djygpoheo@published" data-word-count="59"&gt;I quickly became extremely tired. I found myself unable to leave the house anytime after 4 p.m. I was typically in bed between before 10 p.m. each night, sleeping until sometime between 7 and 8 a.m. I only allowed myself one eight-ounce cup of coffee versus the normal two to three cups I had come to depend on prepregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaosdui8002c3b6d6s9o1f6p@published" data-word-count="82"&gt;I started doing a lot of creative things that you wouldn’t normally find me doing, and because I was unmedicated, it was mass chaos. Learning to knit did not go well. I tried to get back into creative writing, but I struggled to put together a cohesive sentence. I wanted to become an influencer on TikTok, but I couldn’t settle on an angle. I also tried to kick off tons of DIY projects, like redesigning my home office. Those fell flat, too.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaose4gc002r3b6dcdy9v74c@published" data-word-count="33"&gt;In July, I landed another communications job. I knew it wasn’t a natural fit for me, but I took it as a matter of convenience, for both the maternity leave and remote work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaoseape002z3b6dlbv8dhfl@published" data-word-count="62"&gt;My doctor told me the second trimester was often easier for a lot of people with ADHD and I noticed that. Like when it came to nesting, I was able to concentrate because it was a hyperfixation. I did in-depth cleaning, built out a bunch of to-do lists, and got into the weeds of pregnancy Reddit boards. That worked to my benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaoseapf00303b6dbknyceo5@published" data-word-count="74"&gt;Our baby shower was a whole production. It was the weekend of Halloween, and Kai and I dressed up as Jack and Sally from &lt;em&gt;The Nightmare Before Christmas&lt;/em&gt;. We developed &lt;em&gt;Family Feud&lt;/em&gt;–style games, hired a DJ — things you normally don’t have for a baby shower. We had a Christmas tree, a decorating station for ornaments, a face painter … I love a theme, and I dived into it because I wasn’t as regulated.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaoseapf00313b6d0abmxqqi@published" data-word-count="62"&gt;On the flip side, I lost or forgot a lot of stuff. I once had to drive an hour home to get a set of keys that I forgot. When I’m medicated, my mind is like &lt;em&gt;I Spy&lt;/em&gt;, and I can recall things and know where they go. But pregnant and without my medication, I was getting lost in a paper bag.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaoseapf00323b6d7ve9w296@published" data-word-count="58"&gt;It helped that I saw my psychiatrist twice a month. He kept saying that this wasn’t easy, but I was more than capable of doing it. He reminded me to be kind to myself as well. Still, it was very evident to those I love that I was a good version of myself, but not my “usual best.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaoseapf00333b6dpdpr9wbf@published" data-word-count="31"&gt;My psychiatrist was super nervous about me going into depression, so well before my due date, we planned that I would start up all my medication again soon after giving birth.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaoselv2003i3b6dp7z7yqka@published" data-word-count="41"&gt;One of the elements of my ADHD is that something will bother me for five minutes, and then I can forget it 15 minutes later. As a kid, I’d get really hurt, cry for like 20 minutes, and then move on.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaoseup2003q3b6dp0sd6s7f@published" data-word-count="52"&gt;I think that helped me out when it came to childbirth. I genuinely thought contractions were going to be electrifying. But to me, they felt like severe but manageable gas pains. By the time I started feeling them and made my way to my doctor’s office, I was already nine centimeters dilated.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaoseup2003r3b6dik3ao5kq@published" data-word-count="62"&gt;Meeting my son was just incredible. I felt complete the moment he was in my arms. I had joked throughout my pregnancy that our baby could look like Kai as long as he had my nose, so the first thing Kai said was, “He has your nose.” I was laughing and crying and couldn’t believe this tiny little being was really ours.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaosf49i00463b6dgglgbvlu@published" data-word-count="91"&gt;Our baby lost some weight in the hospital and after we got home. I went into panic mode, trying to figure out how to get him to eat and make sure he was okay. I was so stressed. I went down a rabbit hole online, checking with “Dr. Google,” joining a bunch of Facebook groups, texting other mom friends. I think if I’d been taking ADHD medication at the time, it would have rerouted me in a way where I could be like, &lt;em&gt;I can figure this out&lt;/em&gt;. But I couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaosfcxo004e3b6db2va0q0q@published" data-word-count="43"&gt;Within a few days of giving birth, my psychiatrist increased my antidepressant use and dosage because it was the least likely of all my medications to pass through breastmilk. I didn’t feel the difference immediately. I felt like I was running on fumes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaosfcxo004f3b6dqw3i22kw@published" data-word-count="74"&gt;I’m like a toddler in the sense that if I don’t eat or sleep or I feel overstimulated, I’m not nice. I was calling my friends crying, and yelling at Kai — I could be pretty vicious. Sometimes I’d even go at my parents, who were trying to help me. I think Kai was like, &lt;em&gt;Oh shit. I gotta do more because she’s gonna have an ultimate breakdown&lt;/em&gt;. We both wanted to avoid that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaosfcxp004g3b6d4x5dfgb8@published" data-word-count="18"&gt;After a month and a half, I was cleared to restart my ADHD medicine. But there were guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaosfcxp004h3b6dje7hrl30@published" data-word-count="54"&gt;I had to carefully schedule when I could pump milk or breastfeed to avoid transferring it to my son. That was anxiety-inducing. Not only was I exhausted and sleep-deprived and caring for a little human, but timing a pump schedule! But I needed my medication in order to want to get out of bed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaosfcxp004i3b6d6erfz0et@published" data-word-count="44"&gt;Within an hour of taking that first low dose of my fast-acting ADHD medication, I felt the effects. It was 100 percent a relief. When I’m not medicated, I feel like my world is spinning. Once I take it, things start to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaosfcxp004j3b6d5xinjbqq@published" data-word-count="70"&gt;The medication anchored my thinking and helped get me organized. And weirdly, it helped with social cues, like, better understanding my baby’s cries. I couldn’t preemptively stop him from crying, but I could think, &lt;em&gt;What is the next thing I have to do for him?&lt;/em&gt; My emotional regulation became a lot better. Before I restarted the meds, I would find myself wanting to cry more and being so easily overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaosfcxp004k3b6dpomiwsgy@published" data-word-count="56"&gt;Eventually, when I started to notice really hard crashes in my energy, like wanting to go to bed early in the evening, my psychiatrist started me back on the extended-release version of the ADHD medication, at a higher dose. That let me wake up and have brain power. I could focus and maintain my energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;

I loved feeling my baby doing circles in my stomach. I loved when I felt his hiccups. I loved having an excuse to eat what I wanted. I think it’s awesome to carry life. But I don’t know if Kai and I will have more kids. Stopping my medication was one of the hardest things I’ve done. I am extremely fortunate to be back on my meds and in therapy. It’s helped me understand on an even deeper level that doing what’s best for me enables me to do what’s best for our son.&lt;/p&gt;

While the average duration of ADHD medication was over three years, a quarter of treated children remained on it for over seven, and some for nearly a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite widespread and increasing use, long-term safety data from controlled clinical trials only extend to one year. Researchers stress the need for more rigorous studies and annual reassessments, urging caution when prescribing medications to children at sensitive developmental stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prolonged Use:&lt;/strong&gt; A quarter of children stayed on ADHD meds for over 7 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; Boys started younger and stayed on medication longer than girls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety Concerns:&lt;/strong&gt; No controlled clinical trials have assessed safety beyond 1 year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Turku&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The use of ADHD medication has increased notably in recent years, but its long-term effects in children have not been sufficiently studied, despite years of use. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent population-based register study found that the average duration of ADHD medication treatment for Finnish children and adolescents was over three years. In the quarter of children with the longest duration of ADHD medication treatment, the treatment lasted more than seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109971"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a child, a calendar and pill bottles." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ahdh-meds-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The longest duration of ADHD medication was for boys who started medication at the age of 6–8 years. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an important research opening, as the duration of long-term use of ADHD medication in children and adolescents in everyday life has only been studied to a very limited extent,” says the study lead Päivi Ruokoniemi, a Specialist in both Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics and Child Psychiatry from the University of Helsinki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Boys treated more often and for longer periods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that both gender and the age at which ADHD medication is started have a significant effect on the duration of treatment. On average, ADHD treatment lasted just over a year longer for boys than for girls. For both genders, an early age of onset led to longer medication treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The longest duration of ADHD medication was for boys who started medication at the age of 6–8 years. The median duration of their medication treatment was 6.3 years, and for a quarter of them the treatment lasted more than 9.4 years. This group was also the largest group to start ADHD medication. Boys aged 6 to 8 accounted for 32.4 percent of the study subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that a significant proportion of young children, especially boys, are on ADHD medication for years, throughout their comprehensive school years. In this context, it is worrying that reliable research data on the safety of these medicines is only available for a follow-up period of up to one year. After all, we are talking about children at a very sensitive stage of development,” says Ruokoniemi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Studies on long-term effects lacking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most reliable evidence for the safety of medicines comes from clinical, controlled, and randomised trials. For the regulatory approval of ADHD medications, the European Medicines Agency requires pharmaceutical companies to establish clinical safety with a study covering at least one year of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The long-term effects of ADHD medicines have been studied extensively in various observational and uncontrolled research settings, but these are always prone to confounding and therefore do not provide reliable information on cause-and-effect relationships,” continues Ruokoniemi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Due to these uncertainties, it is important that ADHD medication is only started when non-pharmacological treatments have been deemed insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even in this case, it must be ensured that both the caregiver and the child, in accordance with the child’s age and level of development, have access to sufficient information on the expected benefits and harms of the medicine and the uncertainties associated with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also recommend that the need for ADHD medication that has already been started should be reviewed annually by a medical doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The descriptive register study, recently published in the journal &lt;em&gt;European Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, was carried out as a research collaboration between the Universities of Turku and Helsinki and the Finnish Social Insurance Institution Kela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data used in the study was from the register of dispensations reimbursable under the National Health Insurance Scheme for the years 2008–2019. The data included nearly 41,000 children and young people who had started medication treatment in Finland. The duration of medication treatment was estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the last year of the study data, the prevalence of ADHD medication was 5–6 percent for boys and 1.3–1.5 percent for girls. Since then, the use of ADHD medication has continued to increase both globally and also in Finland, where the increase has been even faster than in other Nordic countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that the proportion of Finnish children and adolescents using ADHD medication in Finland has already doubled since the years we conducted our research,” says Ruokoniemi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and ADHD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#45262a2828302b2c2624312c2a2b36053031306b232c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tuomas Koivula&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://utu.fi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Turku&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Tuomas Koivula – University of Turku&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00787-025-02735-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Duration of ADHD medication treatment among Finnish children and adolescents ‒ a nationwide register study&lt;/a&gt;” by Päivi Ruokoniemi et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;European Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration of ADHD medication treatment among Finnish children and adolescents ‒ a nationwide register study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Aim&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To study the duration of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication treatment among children and adolescents by sex and age group in Finland during 2008–2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a descriptive, population-based register study covering all Finnish children and adolescents aged 6–18 years who initiated their first ADHD medication treatment period between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2019 (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 40691). To establish the duration of use we collected data from the register of Dispensations reimbursable under the National Health Insurance Scheme register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The median follow-up time was 3.8 years (Q1 = 1.7, Q3 = 7.1). Treatment duration was calculated as the interval between the date of the first and last purchase with a cut-off of 365 days allowed between purchases. The durations were estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The median duration of ADHD medication treatment was 3.2 years (95% CI 3.2, 3.3, Q1 = 1.0 95% CI 0.9, 1.0, Q3 = 6.8 95% CI 6.7, 7.0). Sex and age significantly influenced treatment duration (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt;.0001 and &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt;.0001). Boys had longer treatment duration than girls and the younger the subject, the longer the duration of usage. Boys aged 6–8 years (32.4% of the subjects) exhibited the longest treatment duration with a median of 6.3 years (95% CI 6.2, 6.5, Q1 = 2.6 95% CI 2.5, 2.7, Q3 = 9.4 years 95% CI 9.2, 9.6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The duration of ADHD medication treatment among children in the real-world clinical setting goes well beyond the data available from randomized controlled trials and extends for several years especially among young boys.&lt;/p&gt;

in each lung, plus two beside her heart, and tumors in her spine, lymph nodes and adrenal glands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s so widespread – it’s everywhere,’ the Toronto-based nanny said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In July 2023, she detected a single lump adjacent to her right breast, which she brushed off as 'just a cyst.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It looked more like an ingrown hair or an under-the-skin pimple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when Engle continued to find new lumps forming in different areas, she knew something was amiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors discovered after an X-ray that the lumps were miniature tumors all over her body after cancerous skin cells had spread through her bloodstream to other organs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking back, other symptoms she brushed off were clearly linked: unintentional weight gain, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Until learning that she has stage IV melanoma, Engle was a healthy young woman with a few benign moles that doctors had removed out of caution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At first, doctors at the urgent care also believed the lumps were relatively benign cysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But X-rays confirmed the worst: the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13476403/I-diagnosed-Stage-4-skin-cancer-22-despite-having-no-visible-moles-marks-never-tanning.html"&gt;melanoma&lt;/a&gt; had invaded her lungs, bones, and brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The odds of dying from the cancer are exponentially higher once it has spread to other parts of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just one in five patients with stage 4 melanoma are still alive five years after being diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, not only is Engle still here two years later, her cancer has since stabilized and is no longer growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Engle began chemotherapy and immunotherapy treatments just a few days after her diagnosis in June 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Although my diagnosis is stage four and has spread almost everywhere, it still does not mean “terminal,”’ she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Here I am in 2025, almost two years into my stage four diagnosis, with now so many options for treatment, and they have much more hope for prolonging my life.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Engle said lumps like the one shown began appearing all over her body. Urgent care doctors first told her they were likely benign cysts. But her ongoing nausea and fatigue led her to the hospital for further testing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;‘Here I am in 2025, almost two years into my stage four diagnosis, with now so many options for treatment, and they have much more hope for prolonging my life,' Engle said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of May 2025, she has received 18 rounds of an immunotherapy drug called Nivolumab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Engle started dual immunotherapy but stopped after two doses due to autoimmune hepatitis—a condition where the immune system attacks the liver, causing inflammation and potential damage &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After getting over her hepatitis, in addition to radiation treatments for tumors in her brain and eyes, Engle continued a regimen of nivolumab alone.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it'll be a constant fight for rest of her life type thing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Likely I could be in treatment for the rest of my life, but there are cases of people with NED (no evidence of disease),’ she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Until learning her devastating diagnosis, Engle was a healthy young woman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors had, over the years, removed several benign moles out of an abundance of caution.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moles are groupings of normal melanin-forming cells. But damage to the DNA of those cells, often through heavy exposure to UV rays, can cause skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Engle, a Toronto-based nanny, has come to terms with the fact that she will likely be on cancer medication for the rest of her life, but is confident that she will beat the survival odds &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Until learning her devastating diagnosis, Engle was a healthy young woman with a few benign moles that doctors had removed out of caution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer cells can then break away from the original tumor and enter the lymphatic system, a network of vessels throughout the body, and the bloodstream, where they can multiply and form more tumors, which were the lumps all over Engle’s body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘By the time I was diagnosed, I was [already] convinced I had cancer, but even so, finding out for sure was a shock,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But it felt validating that I knew something was wrong with my body.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She faced a bumpy road in trying to find the cancer treatment that worked for her, including her bout of autoimmune hepatitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My girlfriend and I were out shopping when I got a call from my oncologist who said my liver ALT numbers were very high – normally they should be under 50, and mine were up to 500.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They said I needed to go to the hospital immediately for IV steroids, which I got every day for a week or so to bring the numbers down and then could eventually start treatment again once they were.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had to take a break from treatment again in October 2024 when she began suffering breathing trouble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An chest X-ray found the true cause – stage four melanoma [skin cancer], which had spread throughout her body, including seven tumors in her brain, and more than 20 tumors in each of her lungs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Engle's future remains uncertain. Advances in immunotherapy and highly targeted therapies have accelerated over the past decade, with promising evidence that they can shrink tumors, extend survival, and, in some cases, achieve long-term remission from advanced cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Given the 20 tumors in each lung and the immunotherapy she was taking, doctors first feared it was a case of pneumonitis, or swelling of her lung tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luckily, it was not, and doctors concluded that the life-sustaining drugs she was taking were not the cause. Rather, it was likely a result of the cancerous tumors in her lungs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she was placed on the steroid prednisone for months, infamous for its side effects, including agitation, ‘moon face’, and swelling elsewhere in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toronto is a hub for medical innovation, allowing Engle access to the most cutting-edge treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She will soon undergo a blood test that will screen for specific indications like tumor mutations or immune markers, which will determine whether she is suitable for Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocyte therapy (TIL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It uses her own immune cells found within her tumors, which are extracted and taken to a lab where scientists isolate a mix of immune cells – mostly T cells – that had infiltrated the tumors but were overtaken by the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists then multiply them exponentially and place them in bioreactors that infuse them with nutrients and growth factors, creating an army of immune cells that are reinfused into Engle’s body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘[It] isn’t approved in Canada yet, but the US drug company has agreed for me to get compassionate treatment here before it’s approved for trial in Canada, which will be done by my oncologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Engle, shown entering the MRI machine, has received 18 rounds of an immunotherapy drug called Nivolumab. The results were mixed initially, with some tumors shrinking and some growing. But most lesions have stabilized&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My oncologist thinks it could be an amazing option and I could likely continue my immunotherapy afterwards if needed!’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her future remains uncertain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Advances in immunotherapy and highly targeted therapies have accelerated over the past decade, with promising evidence that they can shrink tumors, extend survival, and, in some cases, achieve long-term remission from advanced cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I will try anything to let me live a full life,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But I'm just enjoying every day as much as I can and I have a lot of hope for the future, whether that be treatment ongoing, or becoming cancer free, which is the ideal goal for me – and which I know I can achieve eventually.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A mole that becomes itchy, painful or tender should not be ignored. Additionally, moles that 'bleed, become sore, or start to weep fluid' are alarming signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Key warning signs of a potentially cancerous mole include rapid growth, color changes, and irregular shape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A mole that grows noticeably within weeks, develops multiple or uneven colors (such as brown, black, red, white, or blue), or becomes asymmetrical should be evaluated by a doctor, as these changes may indicate skin cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thirty percent of melanoma cases starts in moles, but there are a small percentage of cases that can't be traced back to one site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates that nearly 105,000 cases of melanoma will be diagnosed in 2024, and roughly four percent will be stage four.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melanoma kills more than 8,300 Americans each year, according to the Melanoma Research Foundation (MRF), but about 90 percent of cases are considered to be preventable through vigilance about sun safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age of diagnosis is 63 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, melanoma is one of the most common cancers in people under 30, and has been increasing 'dramatically' over the past three decades, according to Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 15:44:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizAFBVV95cUxONnZQM3NLbzFDUkNKNjM5eGxKV1VENkt3UHFMNzBzMWxMTS02OVlvb3ZfamNZcUdIdm1odkVxMm5PNzdoOEdmVmxlTUJsZGhIUnZvcHJoV2dSSWx5bjNvLXMxdEozSlN6T0l2N3ZCeFN1TUkyMWZqdDF2eVYyQV9tdExXNjNsSk9XeUNpTV9LUkRQRmZUbFpVQjhxenRKUmN5T0xJNkl6bDRuaHhOOUZyRGNueHhwNjlCclRkN0o5aW1mNU9tdWVmMnJXZWg</guid></item><item><title>亲爱的Annie ：我担心我妻子已经放弃了生活，我无能为力- NJ.com | Dear Annie: I’m concerned that my wife has given up on life and there’s nothing I can do to help - NJ.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TM4FWDFGBZDLPJ4YBHNWF5Q2FM"&gt;DEAR ANNIE: I am concerned that my wife has given up on life and there is nothing I can do to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5ODYZOBHYREE7MXWNW3UXODYTU"&gt;For background, I am a 67-year-old man, and my wife is around the same age. We married about 20 years ago, and she was able-bodied and working. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RMI3D2G2T5DCNDT3OQONL3MY4A"&gt;She has multiple health issues. She is at high risk for cardiovascular problems, based on family history. She was put on a statin and something for blood pressure. She has asthma and frequent coughing spells. Over time, she has repeatedly resisted medical testing. She has never had a mammogram or a colonoscopy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2OBARKBOKJBSVNU5GXX2BARPPE"&gt;More recently, she started to develop some kind of neurological symptoms. I got her to go to a neurologist and the preliminary screening suggested possible Parkinson’s. A second neuro appointment was inconclusive. They referred her for an MRI or some type of scan, and at that point, she refused to go further in finding out what was wrong. Since then, her ability to stand and walk have gotten worse. She can only walk short distances with assistance. She needs help getting in and out of bed or a chair. She cannot get in or out of the shower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6XC7Z42IGFEVVP5URKSGQWDNP4"&gt;Every effort I have made to help her has been frustrated. She has not been to a doctor for years, going back before the COVID epidemic. She no longer gets refills for her medications, and she doesn’t take them anyway. We had the bath tub modified to help her step into it. She has not used it since it was completed. I had a stair lift installed to help her get up and down the stairs. She has never used it and asked me to get it removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NF5FBOQGYNE7XOCPJBBP2K4I4Y"&gt;The combination of physical problems means that that she is at risk of death or injury almost all the time. She could die of heart attack or stroke. She has frequent choking or near-choking incidents, almost every time she eats. And every trip up or downstairs, or a trip from bed to the bathroom could mean a fall and serious injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7ZBTGRB3UNFLHGWDLOAVJ45DCA"&gt;I have just about given up on trying to convince her to do anything about her medical condition. If I even hint at it she just says, “No more doctors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="C37NH6OMDNFSPDV5VRVIKDGWBY"&gt;Is there something I can do to get her to see a doctor?

Reach out to a home health agency or a geriatric care manager. Even if your wife won’t engage with them directly, they can help assess your home and suggest ways to reduce fall risks or choking hazards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MKATCNLLXBD6FLOJOQLU6IO574"&gt;Lastly, you need support, too.

I’m Shirley Leung. This is episode 3 of our series “The C-Word: Stories of Cancer.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Today we start with a question: How far would you go to keep a secret for someone you love? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Would you risk their life? Support their lies until it was too late? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Barrett Rollins did that for his wife, Jane. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Jane hid her advanced breast cancer until she collapsed at work, unable to breathe. And here‘s the wrinkle: They’re both world class oncologists. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Now, what would compel two cancer doctors to keep a secret like that? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The reasons are complex — and mystifying — and 10 years after Jane‘s death, Barrett still wrestles with them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Barrett and Jane worked together at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute here in Boston. He recounts Jane‘s tragic story in a recent book called “In Sickness: A Memoir.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I asked Barrett the question that had been bugging me since I read the book: How? How did Jane hide her illness for so long? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Barrett Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; That’s the critical question, isn’t it? How could she have hidden something so prominent from her husband and from everybody else and from all the doctors that she worked with? I think it’s important to understand that this book is not just a book about cancer and somebody’s cancer journey, it’s also a book about a marriage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

Maybe it was more complicated than some other marriages, but all marriages I think at some level are complicated. We had about 20 years of a really, really great marriage. And then all of a sudden, 20 years in, things changed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Jane became a little more withdrawn, all intimacy stopped. After a while, it just became easier for me to sleep in another room, and I never really understood why. I had to make a decision: Do I stay with her? Do I object? Do I leave? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I was just completely in love with her. We had a wonderful relationship in every other domain, so I decided to stick it out. It’s a complicated story as you know from reading the book. About five years after that, Jane unwillingly revealed her diagnosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; This is where she collapsed in the bathroom. Tell that story. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; We had a pretty set routine. We worked really hard during the week. I was still working on the weekends, but Jane just totally shut off on the weekends and she would spend most of the weekends in bed. We were in our own little bubble, very hermetic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I was puttering around on a Saturday morning and I suddenly heard her call out from the bathroom and she said, “I need you.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I knocked and came in and I was confronted with this sight of my wife lying on the floor of our bathroom. She was dressed in her usual Saturday outfit, which was a long caftan dress, sort of from her neck to her toes, but it had been slightly unzipped and underneath the caftan, on one shoulder, was a towel. I could see that the towel was beginning to be soaked in blood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I said, “My God, what’s happening?” And Jane said, “I’m dying.” Very matter of fact, “I’m dying.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And I said, “What are you talking about, you’re dying.” She said, “I have breast cancer. It’s starting to bleed and I’m dying.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I said, “Well, you know, I gotta call 911,” and she said, “Don’t.” And I said “Don’t be ridiculous.” It ended up being a shouting match. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;She ultimately said, “If you call 911, I will never forgive you and I will never speak to you again.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; She would rather die on the bathroom floor?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; Absolutely. And she made it clear. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Here‘s where my accommodating personality accommodated. I sat down, she had brought the newspaper in with her. I said, “What do you want me to do?” She said, “Well, just read to me.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I can still remember sitting on the toilet seat with her on the floor. I read most of the first section of the New York Times to her. How pathetic is that? This was while she‘s telling me that she‘s dying, but of course she wasn’t dying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The bleeding stopped after about 30 to 45 minutes. She checked the wound. She saw she wasn’t bleeding, and said, “Okay, everything’s fine. You can go now.” I said, “Well, I can’t go now. We have to talk about this.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We‘re never gonna talk about this.” That’s what she said. And again, “If you bring this up, I will leave you and I will never forgive you.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;So for the next four or five years, I was complicit in her desire to hide what was going on. I was complicit to the extent that I could convince myself there was no problem. I really kind of believed that everything was fine until another medical emergency, about five years after that, revealed her disease to the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; You spend so much of the book wrestling with Jane‘s actions and decisions, and you write that denial is too simple of an explanation. Can you talk a little bit about why you think Jane didn’t want anyone to know she was sick? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; One thing is, on the sort of personal level for Jane, she had a phobia about medicine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In all the years we were together, I never saw her go to the dentist. She never had a mammogram. She never had a colonoscopy. She never had a primary care physician. There was something in her that was phobic about medicine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There are just ironies upon ironies here, right? Because she decided to go into medicine. And not just anything, she goes into cancer medicine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; And Dana-Farber is known for its research for finding medicines, to cure cancer or treat cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins: &lt;/b&gt;Absolutely. Not only that, but for screening and prevention, all the other things. She‘s a first responder that runs to the fire. She runs into the building. There was something in her makeup that made her want to do that, probably because she was disappointed in herself because of her phobia. So that’s one thing, put that in one category. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The other thing that Jane recognized, which you may resonate with, is that when somebody gets a diagnosis of cancer, all of a sudden it’s like flipping a switch. People treat that person differently. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung: &lt;/b&gt;Yep. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins: &lt;/b&gt;There‘s this patronizing, “Oh, are you okay? What can I do for you?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;It was very important for Jane to be seen as strong. She saw that when people at Harvard Medical School are perceived as weak, they lose all their advantages. And she was really worried that everyone‘s attitude would change if anybody knew she had cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And then there‘s this other thing about people with cancer. They’re told, not so much by their physicians, but they’re told by society in general, now that you have cancer, your job is to be a fighter. You have to fight this thing, fight it day and night. And fighters are winners. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There‘s an aspect of that that is absolutely wonderful. But what Jane objected to, was it creates a false situation in which the person with cancer, because they’re now fighters, believe they have agency. And they really don’t. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But if they believe they have agency over this because they’re fighting, and then through no fault of theirs, their treatment doesn’t work or the cancer that goes away comes back, what’s the implication? The implication is you’ve lost the fight. You’re a loser, you didn’t fight hard enough. Which is very, very destructive. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I think cancer patients have agency to the extent that they can make choices about whether or not they’re gonna get treatment. And in that respect, Jane retained agency, I think she used it incorrectly, but she retained it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And then the final thing is, and I wish it was all about this because this last thing is actually rational whereas I think most of what Jane did was irrational, Jane‘s research helped to establish the notion that people, not just patients with cancer, care more about the quality of their life than the quantity of their life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Over and over again when you survey people, they care about how they’re living. They would trade length for quality over and over again. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Even in the last year of her life, while she was bed-bound and unable to do anything, she published a really important paper in the New England Journal of Medicine about this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;At that time, 10 or 12 years ago, metastatic breast cancer was not curable. She knew she couldn’t be cured and she knew just how toxic chemotherapy was in those days. It’s one of the reasons she stopped seeing patients very soon after her training was over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Her patients loved her, and she loved taking care of patients. But this notion that she was going to make somebody deathly ill by writing an order in a chart, she couldn’t stand that. She didn’t want that for herself. Now that was the most rational thing, but all these other things were also there too, and they were pretty irrational.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; When reading the book, I got really mad, at first at Jane and then I got mad at you, really mad at you. Jane collapses, you don’t call 911 then you just slowly let her die of breast cancer. How did you do that? How did that happen?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Through the process of writing this book, you must have thought about that, right? I don’t know if you’ve thought about how that happened. You wouldn’t advise anyone to do that? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; Oh my God, no. You know, you are just the latest in a long line of people who’ve said they’re really mad at me. I’ve sort of struggled to understand that, because it’s complicated. I wrote this book and I hadn’t decided to publish it right away, but I just felt it was important to write it so that I could try to understand a little bit better what had happened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But then as I struggled with whether or not to publish it, I began to feel incredibly guilty about even thinking that because here‘s Jane who spent a decade hiding everything and what right did I have to display it all? It just felt like an incredible betrayal. So I was already mad at myself, but not for the reasons you were mad at me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;It took me a while to understand that other people were mad at me because I didn’t act the way… &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung: &lt;/b&gt;You had a responsibility. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; I absolutely did. I had a duty to act, as her husband. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; And you’re a doctor. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; Thanks. Can we get some of the reporters to come in and pile on?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But you’re right, you’re absolutely right. And this is what I still feel incredibly terrible about. I haven’t resolved this, other than to understand it is in my nature to be accommodating. Not just accommodating for my own good, but I really thought I understood what it took to make this endlessly fascinating, charismatic woman, happy. I had spent decades doing that already.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Another way to think about my duty, is my duty was to make her as happy as I could. In a convoluted way, allowing her to die on her own terms, made her happy. So, that’s another way to think about this. I was fulfilling that responsibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

Walker/Globe Staff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; Right, I did come around. It was like an emotional rollercoaster. First I was mad at Jane, then I was really mad at you. But in the end, it’s Jane‘s life, it was her choice. So I was less mad at you at the end because, right, it was her choice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I also felt like your book laid bare that she made the wrong choice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; She did. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I have talked to people who are, let’s say, in the Robert F. Kennedy Jr. camp, and I’ve heard somebody say, “This Harvard cancer doctor decided not to get treatment, so nobody should get treatment.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I actually did have a conversation with one person about this and said, “That’s nuts. My book shows you that it was the wrong decision.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; That’s what I took away. If you do what Jane did, then you’ll suffer more than you have to. She could still be alive today given the advance in medicine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; That’s possible. At the very least, her life would not have been so miserable. I write in some detail about what it took every single day to do the dressing changes; it was so complicated. It was like the invasion of Normandy, every day. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;She was miserable because this thing was bleeding. It got infected. It smelled bad. If she had gotten treatment, that probably wouldn’t have happened. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; So how unusual are “Janes” in the world of oncology? The patients who are in denial and refuse treatment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; It’s not that uncommon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;All of us in oncology have, in the back of our minds, a small cadre of patients that we saw who would come in with long, neglected cancers of various sorts because of fear or their own phobias. Once the book was written, I started getting comments and emails from people saying, “Thank you for writing this. It reminds me of when my mother did the same thing, or reminds me of when my cousin did the same thing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There is a large population of people out there who are doing this, and I think it’s one of the deficiencies that we as oncologists have lived with. We need to think more about how to reach out to people who don’t want to be seen and think that their treatment is gonna be worse than their disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There will be people who are stubborn and delusional like Jane who thought the treatment was worse than her disease, but I’m here to tell you it really wasn’t. There are other people who I think can be convinced, if we do it the right way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; So do you think people are more scared of cancer than other diseases and that’s why they put off treatment? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; I do. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I think it’s pretty clear that people are scared of cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung: &lt;/b&gt;And why is it so scary? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; Well, I think there are a couple reasons. One is a historical reason. People are scared of what they don’t understand. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;If you think about Tuberculosis, for example, this was a disease that was the staple of European literature for a couple centuries. If you think about what happens, people just suddenly start losing weight. They become listless. It’s kind of just tailor-made for some kind of romantic story in which Tuberculosis is a visitation for some sin this person committed either in this life or a previous life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;It wasn’t until the discovery of the bacteria that causes Tuberculosis that you had a rational way to think about it. So nobody talks about this anymore. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Cancer was the same sort of thing. For centuries, nobody knew what caused cancer. It was this mystery, also of visitation, and it was organ specific. There are all sorts of myths that you can come up with about why someone might have developed cancer. We had no treatment and, again, for which we didn’t understand the origin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;That is really changing now with discoveries that really show what the cause is, treatments that are directed at that cause, but that’s gonna take a while.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But I think the other thing that’s unique about cancer is the way it distorts the organs that it involves. It directly impacts bodily autonomy. As we go through the world, I think that we imagine ourselves as intact entities that interact with other people. Cancer attacks that intactness. It creates lumps in your breast, it creates broken bones, it creates a stroke-like syndrome if you have brain cancer. There are things that it does that destroy the sort of compactness and wholeness of the body, and I think that’s fundamentally terrifying to people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I think a lot of people who either have cancer or have a certain turn of mind, can be scared to death that’s gonna happen to them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung: &lt;/b&gt;You studied medicine for decades before you encountered this experience with Jane. You write in the book about changing the dressings on her chest. It was really difficult for you to be on the other side, to be the caretaker and to be so vulnerable to a disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;How did that experience change your perspective as a doctor? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; The whole experience changed my perspective, but I’m thinking particularly about treating Jane‘s tumor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I think your listeners who haven’t read the book need to know that the right side of Jane‘s chest was completely replaced by this football-sized mass. It was misshapen, parts of it were dying. It turned black. Other parts were infected and there were parts that were bleeding all the time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;These kinds of things always bothered me, even when I was in medical school.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; Squeamish to blood? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins: &lt;/b&gt;Not to blood, not to blood. This is very specific. Blood didn’t bother me and people who were very sick didn’t bother me, but there was something about big tumors that were decaying and destroying somebody’s body that made me sort of reach for the rails because I was afraid I was gonna faint.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The first time I saw this was the day Jane had this event. When we were at Dana-Farber, we always had lunch together. We were on our way to lunch and she just collapsed. She‘d had a huge clot, traveled from her legs up into her lungs. When we got to the emergency room, they took off her clothes and there was this thing which I had never seen before. I sort of looked at it from a distance and I thought, “Oh, this is what she‘s talking about.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;My insight into this is that people can ultimately handle anything. There‘s nothing special about me. I took care of her for a year. I helped the visiting nurses change the dressings for a year. I think people should take heart in knowing that I, a kind of neurotic otherwise normal guy, could eventually step up and do all this stuff when necessary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And I think people are doubting their ability to do that. It should take some strength from the fact that I could do it and other people do it all the time. We should provide support for them, but people are strong enough to do this. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; Also, it was an incredible act of love, a final act of love to take care of her the way you did at the end.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; I think there‘s another lesson here. It’s a negative lesson. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Jane and I had this hermetic relationship. Jane, she kept her family at a distance. There‘s all kinds of psychodynamic stuff going on there, but she had a sister and a brother and a mother that she just, long before she got sick, kept at a distance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; She didn’t even tell them for a long time that she had cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins: &lt;/b&gt;No, she forbade me to tell them. She kept my daughter at a distance. We didn’t have many friends. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I can’t speak for her, but from my experience, her last year would’ve been very different if I had family support. So there‘s another negative lesson, don’t try to do this by yourself. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; That was one of the things that is so memorable from my cancer journey. Once I told other people and family that I had cancer, I had this incredible outpouring of support.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;You didn’t experience that during the time Jane had cancer. But, I had meals, I had the newsroom put up a collection meal train. People came over and babysat my kids for me. My mom flew in from California and took care of me and did the laundry and helped me change my dressings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins: &lt;/b&gt;That’s so great. So that’s the way it should be, right? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; Yes, that’s the way it should be. Now when I know other people have cancer, I pay it forward. I pay it back. I then provide the meals and support. It’s actually this incredible experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;You feel incredibly human and alive. It’s amazing. I feel bad you didn’t get to experience that because if there‘s a silver lining to cancer, it’s to see humanity come out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; I totally agree.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Once you can blow past the patronizing stuff we talked about earlier, what you get is really authentic and caring support. It is this sort of silver lining. If you have to go through this, and you know we are all doomed to go through something, there‘s that aspect of it that you can look for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; What do you want people to take away from reading your memoir about Jane‘s story? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins:&lt;/b&gt; Well first, I don’t want them to be so mad at me. That’s selfish, I know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; I’m not mad at you anymore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rollins: &lt;/b&gt;Okay. Okay. No, I think there are a couple things. One is that people are infinitely diverse. Everybody’s different. Everybody’s response to what may seem like a common disease is going to be different. We as physicians and also as family members, I hate to use this phrase, have to sort of meet people where they are. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I think Jane is an extreme example of this. If I had been more skillful, I might have been able to let her have the autonomy she was seeking, but in a way that didn’t make her life worse. So I think that’s one lesson. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Another lesson is that we are capable of helping. Don’t believe that you’re not strong enough to take on something that seems to be horrific. I couldn’t have had a nightmare worse than what I had seen when Jane finally collapsed. Yet, we got through that. We had a final year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I think those are the main things. And then the last thing is we should also be thinking about those who have survived the deaths of the people they loved. Those survivors have been touched very deeply. They’re not the same people they were before this happened. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;This was really one of the reasons that I ended up publishing this book at all. I felt very guilty about revealing Jane‘s secret. I talked to Jane‘s sister, who as it turns out, is an author, and I gave her a copy of the book. She said she was mad at me, but then she said she liked it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I said, “Well, can I publish this? It just doesn’t seem right to be able to do this.” And what she said I think was really important. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;She said, “For a long time, this was Jane‘s story. But now it’s your story and you can do whatever you want with your story.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leung:&lt;/b&gt; Barrett Rollins is a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a longtime cancer researcher. His book is called “In Sickness: A Memoir.” He also has a new book called “First the Patient,” about another fascinating medical story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Listen to more “Say More” episodes at&lt;a href="http://globe.com/saymore" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; globe.com/saymore&lt;/a&gt; and wherever you get your podcasts.

These peri-LC neurons modulate the locus coeruleus by releasing GABA, which reduces its activity and dampens the release of norepinephrine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This system allows the brain to respond differently to various challenges, such as suppressing pain while heightening motor activity in emergencies. Researchers used advanced techniques to map and profile these neurons, uncovering distinct subtypes in both regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peri-LC Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Peri-LC neurons regulate arousal by inhibiting locus coeruleus activity using GABA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Modulation:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain tailors its response to threats by fine-tuning different systems—like enhancing movement while suppressing pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting this circuit may help treat anxiety, PTSD, and symptoms of opioid withdrawal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Washington&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A small cluster of cells deep within our brains, called the locus coeruleus, affects how awake and attentive we are, how we respond to stress, how we cope with anxiety and fear, and how we create memories and learn.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The locus coeruleus, Latin for “blue spot,” is also involved in a wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and Alzheimer’s diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109967"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/arousal-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Scientists have inferred that the locus coeruleus must play a nuanced role.  Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite its importance, relatively little is known how the locus coeruleus works. It is known to receive inputs from throughout the central nervous system and to send signals, in the form of the chemical norepinephrine, across the brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has not been clear, however, how it processes the information it receives, nor how that affects how much norepinephrine it releases, and where. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now a new study in mice shows that a small group of cells next to the locus coeruleus, called peri-LC neurons, appear to play a key role in regulating its information-processing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings help explain how we respond appropriately to different challenges, according to Andrew Luskin, a postdoctoral associate in the Laboratory of Neural Dynamics &amp;amp; Cognition at Rockefeller University in New York. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luskin, who conducted the research while he was a graduate student at the University of Washington School of Medicine, is the co-first author of the study with Dr. Li Li, assistant professor of anesthesiology and pain medicine at the UW School of Medicine and a principal investigator at Seattle Children’s Research Institute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Traditionally, the peri-LC has been thought of as sort of a ‘dimmer switch’ for the brain’s level of arousal,” Luskin said, “which globally affects locus coeruleus firing — from a lot, when you’re extremely anxious, to a little, when you’re asleep, and somewhere in the middle when you’re alert but relaxed.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have inferred that the locus coeruleus must play a nuanced role.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If your toddler runs out into the street, you want your motor system tuned up so you can chase after them,” Luskin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But you also want your pain system tuned down, so if you stub your toe as you run, you’ll ignore the pain and focus on catching the child. It is possible that these responses are being fine-tuned by the peri-LC.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study, the researchers observed how neurons in the peri-LC responded when the mice were exposed to different stimuli that increase arousal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found these stimuli tended to cause the peri-LC to release the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid, or GABA. To varying degrees, this decreased the firing of locus coeruleus neurons and reduced their release of norepinephrine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The peri-LC cells apparently act like a radio gain circuit that can dial up or down the strength of the locus coeruleus cells’ response to incoming signals,” said senior author Michael Bruchas, professor of anesthesiology &amp;amp; pain medicine, pharmacology and bioengineering. He is an investigator at the UW School of Medicine’s Center for the Neurobiology of Addiction, Pain and Emotion.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed the anatomy of the peri-LC and detailed how various groups of its neurons affect the neuronal activity of the locus coeruleus differently.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed that, like the locus coeruleus, the peri-LC neurons receive inputs from major centers of the brain and spinal cord but transmit signals almost exclusively to the locus coeruleus. These signals inhibit locus coeruleus neuron firing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also used a technique called single-cell RNA sequencing to identify the different types of neurons in the locus coeruleus and peri-LC, and another technique called pixel-seq to map their exact locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These investigations revealed that both the locus coeruleus and peri-LC have distinct subpopulations of cells, likely with different functions.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides advancing understanding of how our brains regulate arousal, attention and our response to stress and fear, the findings open the possibility of new ways to treat neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, said Li, who studies opioid drug withdrawal.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During withdrawal, for example, we know the locus coeruleus becomes hyperactive,” Li said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With these findings we may be able to identify drug targets either in the locus coeruleus or the peri-LC that will reduce withdrawal symptoms.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper provides researchers with what Bruchas described as a “detailed roadmap” for studying the locus coeruleus and peri-LC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The finding shows us who the key players are, how they connect, and the neurotransmitters involved,” he said. “It will open a lot of doors for a lot of labs.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ec808985808d8bac999bc2898899" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Leila Gray&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uw.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Washington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Leila Gray – University of Washington&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08952-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Heterogeneous pericoerulear neurons tune arousal and exploratory behaviours&lt;/a&gt;” by Andrew Luskin et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heterogeneous pericoerulear neurons tune arousal and exploratory behaviours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the primary source of noradrenaline in the brain, the locus coeruleus (LC) regulates arousal, avoidance and stress responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, how local neuromodulatory inputs control LC function remains unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we identify a population of transcriptionally, spatially and functionally diverse GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-producing) neurons in the LC dendritic field that receive distant inputs and modulate modes of LC firing to control global arousal levels and arousal-related processing and behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We define peri-LC anatomy using viral tracing and combine single-cell RNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics to molecularly define both LC noradrenaline-producing and peri-LC cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identify several neuronal cell types that underlie peri-LC functional diversity using a series of complementary neural circuit approaches in behaving mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that LC and peri-LC neurons are transcriptionally, functionally and anatomically heterogenous neuronal populations that modulate arousal and avoidance states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defining the molecular, cellular and functional diversity of the LC and peri-LC provides a roadmap for understanding the neurobiological basis of arousal, motivation and neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 15:23:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE5fZjdoR29xNXhGMGhYSzUwQ2s1eWltMXBQRTBGR2tXSHFDdnJwc01oRlNHaWZZa1Z4d0ZQTUV6R1k2X0s1SnAxT0VpcWFkNThycHVEbms5U3FqZHNQcFFUdzU0T29vSzU0bERGcndzQWxTQQ</guid></item><item><title>新生儿维生素D缺乏与多动症、精神分裂症和自闭症风险增加有关- Medical Xpress | Newborn vitamin D deficiency linked to higher risk of ADHD, schizophrenia and autism - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxOMl9jbllJNm5tMUNndGFBLTVCSE9aLWk1Sk11cW5YU0k0ajBYeEZncjVjTkhyMFhfVXE3SVNCaVFIVDVzYkNDTkd6dURETTNkUDNBb0oxeUhoNlZWeTBPTzZKV09yV1ZpWlNVUHdsZ2l1WVZMRDJSLXZYQnZBOGo5QTAzbFdhdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newborn babies with a vitamin D deficiency have a higher chance of later developing mental disorders such as ADHD, schizophrenia and autism, a major study involving the University of Queensland has found.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In the largest population study of its kind, researchers examined the vitamin D status of 71,793 people, many of whom had a mental health disorder diagnosed during childhood and early adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(25)00099-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;The research&lt;/a&gt; is published in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor John McGrath from UQ's Queensland Brain Institute led the study that was based at the National Center for Register-Based Research, Aarhus University, and the State Serum Institute in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said they examined six mental disorders: &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/major+depressive+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;major depressive disorder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bipolar+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;, schizophrenia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/autism+spectrum+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;autism spectrum disorder&lt;/a&gt; (ASD) and anorexia nervosa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found evidence that people with lower vitamin D concentration as a baby had an increased risk of schizophrenia, ASD and ADHD," Professor McGrath said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Previous research had linked neonatal vitamin D deficiency with an increased risk of schizophrenia and autism, but this study examined a wider range of mental disorders, and included evidence based on two vitamin D-related biomarkers and related genetics."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor McGrath said their research suggested that vitamin D supplements during pregnancy and early life could help reduce the risk of mental disorders in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Vitamin D is important for a baby's brain development, and low vitamin D levels are common in pregnant women across the globe," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is why many countries recommended the use of vitamin D supplements during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Similar to how folate supplements are recommended during pregnancy to prevent &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/spina+bifida/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;spina bifida&lt;/a&gt;, our research suggests that optimizing vitamin D levels in early life may reduce the risk of several neurodevelopmental disorders."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from the iPSYCH study, which was founded in 2012 to investigate mental disorders in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D usually comes from sun exposure but can also be found in some foods and supplements.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers analyzed data from nearly 2,000 dementia-free adults and found that long sleep duration was associated with worse performance in memory, visuospatial ability, and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These effects were significantly stronger in people with depression, regardless of whether they were on antidepressants. The study suggests that sleep is a modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline and highlights the need to personalize sleep recommendations based on mental health status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Long sleep (&amp;gt;9 hours) was linked to poorer cognition, especially in memory and executive function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depression Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Effects were strongest in people with depressive symptoms, with or without antidepressant use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modifiable Factor:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep duration may be a changeable risk factor for cognitive decline in vulnerable populations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UT San Antonio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There might be such a thing as getting too much of a good night’s sleep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleeping nine hours or more per night is associated with worse cognitive performance, which is even more the case for those with depression, a study led by researchers at The University of Texas Health Science Center (UT Health San Antonio) shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109963"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/excessive-sleep-cognition-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/excessive-sleep-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/excessive-sleep-cognition-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/excessive-sleep-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/excessive-sleep-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/excessive-sleep-cognition-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/excessive-sleep-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/excessive-sleep-cognition-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and a person sleeping." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/excessive-sleep-cognition-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/excessive-sleep-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/excessive-sleep-cognition-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/excessive-sleep-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/excessive-sleep-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/excessive-sleep-cognition-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/excessive-sleep-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Disturbances in sleep duration and patterns have been observed across lifespans and are present in both normal and pathological aging. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They derived the results from an examination of sleep duration and cognition in 1,853 dementia-and-stroke-free participants in the Framingham Heart Study, which is an ongoing community-based cohort study of residents in Framingham, Massachusetts, under the direction of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health. This latest examination focused on those ages 27 to 85 with a mean age of 49.8 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Also, long-sleepers were more likely to report symptoms of depression,” said Vanessa Young, MS, clinical research project manager at the Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer’s and Neurodegenerative Diseases at UT Health San Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sleep may be a modifiable risk for cognitive decline in people with depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young, who also is with the Translational Science PhD program in the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at UT Health San Antonio, is first author of the study titled, “Long sleep duration, cognitive performance, and the moderating role of depression: A cross-sectional analysis in the Framingham Heart Study,” published April 21 in&lt;em&gt; Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors also represent Arizona State University; the Framingham Heart Study; Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal; University of Montreal; Boston University; and Monash University, Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Long but not short sleep duration was associated with poorer global cognition and specific cognitive abilities like memory, visuospatial skills and executive functions,” said Sudha Seshadri, founding director of the Biggs Institute and senior author of the study. “These associations were stronger in people with depressive symptoms, regardless of antidepressant usage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep and brain health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, there is increasing recognition of the significance of sleep as a vital physiological process for brain health. Disturbances in sleep duration and patterns have been observed across lifespans and are present in both normal and pathological aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These disturbances contribute to an increased risk of cognitive deficits and Alzheimer’s disease. The Global Council on Brain Health recommends 7 to 8 hours of nightly sleep for adults to preserve brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several studies have suggested that both excessive and insufficient sleep relative to the prescribed duration are linked to impairments in cognitive domains, including memory, attention and the ability to manage and direct other mental processes, such as planning, problem-solving and controlling impulses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, evidence has been marked by inconsistencies depending on the lifespan being examined, and on health differences such as depression. Depression, a modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline, often co-occurs with sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association between sleep disorders and depression is well established, with about 90% of people with depression reporting problems with sleep, the study notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new research, the scientists investigated whether depression modified the associations between sleep duration and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Framingham participants were categorized into four groups: no depressive symptoms, no antidepressants; depressive symptoms without antidepressant use; antidepressant use without depressive symptoms; and depressive symptoms and antidepressant use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that long sleep was associated with reduced overall cognitive function, with the strongest effects in those with depressive symptoms using and not using antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weaker but significant effects were observed in those without depressive symptoms. No significant associations were observed in participants using antidepressants without depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that, they concluded that associations between sleep duration and cognitive performance are strongest in individuals with depressive symptoms, regardless of antidepressant use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Future longitudinal studies including large-scale, multi-modal approaches are needed to further elucidate the temporal relationship between sleep disturbances and cognitive changes,” the researchers said in their conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and cognition research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e68a838395d4d4a693928e95859587c8838293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Steven Lee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uthscsa.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UT San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Steven Lee – UT San Antonio&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/alz.70160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Long sleep duration, cognitive performance, and the moderating role of depression: A cross-sectional analysis in the Framingham Heart Study&lt;/a&gt;” by Vanessa Young et al. &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long sleep duration, cognitive performance, and the moderating role of depression: A cross-sectional analysis in the Framingham Heart Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70160-sec-0010-title"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We investigated whether depression modified the associations between sleep duration and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70160-sec-0020-title"&gt;METHODS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined the associations between sleep duration and cognition in 1853 dementia-and-stroke-free participants (mean age 49.8 years, [range 27–85]; 42.7% male).

Even after adjusting for genetic risk, health conditions, and lifestyle factors, lonely individuals had a 24% higher chance of developing hearing loss, especially sensorineural types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers suggest that stress-related physiological changes may help explain the connection. Notably, this association was stronger in women and remained consistent across multiple analytical models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Risk Factor:&lt;/strong&gt; Loneliness increases hearing loss risk by 24%, regardless of genetic predisposition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensorineural Emphasis:&lt;/strong&gt; The effect is strongest for sensorineural hearing loss, linked to inner ear or nerve damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex Differences:&lt;/strong&gt; The association was notably stronger in women than men.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Health Data Science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A large-scale cohort study led by researchers from Tianjin University, Shenyang Medical College, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, and the Chinese University of Hong Kong has uncovered strong evidence that loneliness may independently increase the risk of hearing loss. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published in &lt;em&gt;Health Data Science&lt;/em&gt; on May 2, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109951"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older woman sitting alone." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/loneliness-hearing-loss-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The association was especially pronounced for sensorineural hearing loss, a form linked to cochlear or neural damage, and was stronger in women than men. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hearing loss is one of the most prevalent global health conditions, affecting more than 1.5 billion people. While physiological and behavioral risk factors are well-documented, the role of psychosocial factors such as loneliness has been underexplored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study sought to determine whether loneliness is not just a consequence but also a contributing factor to hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from 490,865 participants in the UK Biobank, the researchers tracked individuals over a median period of 12.3 years. Loneliness was measured at baseline through a single-item self-report, and incident hearing loss was identified via electronic health records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results showed that lonely individuals had a 24% higher risk of developing hearing loss compared to their non-lonely counterparts, even after adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, comorbidities, ototoxic drug use, social isolation, depression, and genetic predisposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that loneliness is associated with an increased risk of developing hearing loss, independent of other well-known risk factors,” said Yunlong Song, from the Institute of Applied Psychology at Tianjin University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests a potentially harmful feedback loop in which loneliness and hearing loss exacerbate one another.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association was especially pronounced for sensorineural hearing loss, a form linked to cochlear or neural damage, and was stronger in women than men. Interestingly, while genetic predisposition to hearing loss also increased overall risk, it did not modify the effect of loneliness, indicating loneliness acts through distinct pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors propose multiple mechanisms to explain this relationship, including loneliness-related inflammation, elevated blood pressure, neuroendocrine stress responses, and associated chronic diseases and unhealthy behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings remained robust across sensitivity analyses, including models excluding early cases and incorporating self-reported hearing data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our next step is to investigate the behavioral, psychological, and physiological mechanisms that might explain how loneliness contributes to hearing loss,” said co-author Bin Yu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, we aim to conduct intervention studies to test whether alleviating loneliness can lower the risk of hearing loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this loneliness and hearing loss research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#80f9e1eee7f9f5c0e2eaedf5aee5e4f5aee3ee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yu Yang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://bjmu.edu.cn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Health Data Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Yu Yang – Health Data Science&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.34133/hds.0281" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Loneliness and Risk of Incident Hearing Loss: The UK Biobank Study&lt;/a&gt;” by Yunlong Song et al. &lt;em&gt;Health Data Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loneliness and Risk of Incident Hearing Loss: The UK Biobank Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt; Hearing loss (HL) is one major cause of disability and can lead to social impairments. However, the relationship between loneliness and the risk of incident HL remains unclear. Our study aimed to investigate this association among adults in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; This cohort study was based on data from the UK Biobank study. Loneliness was assessed by asking participants if they often felt lonely. Incident HL was defined as a primary diagnosis, ascertained via linkage to electronic health records. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to examine the association between loneliness and risk of incident HL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; Our analyses included 490,865 participants [mean (SD) age, 56.5 (8.1) years; 54.4% female], among whom 90,893 (18.5%) reported feeling lonely at baseline. Over a median follow-up period of 12.3 years (interquartile range, 11.3 to 13.1), 11,596 participants were diagnosed with incident HL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to non-lonely participants, lonely individuals exhibited an increased risk of HL [hazard ratio (HR), 1.36; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.30 to 1.43]. This association remained (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.31) after adjusting for potential confounders, including age, sex, socioeconomic status, biological and lifestyle factors, social isolation, depression, chronic diseases, use of ototoxic drugs, and genetic risk of HL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The joint analysis showed that loneliness was significantly associated with an increased risk of incident HL across all levels of genetic risks for HL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt; Loneliness was associated with the risk of incident HL independent of other prominent risk factors. Social enhancement strategies aimed at alleviating loneliness may prove beneficial in HL prevention.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 13:58:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTFBvRnFfaXctZjJEOHg3TVd2LVhWVnJQT2w3RnFUQkdIWXM0SXFhUmpGM0YxeFFCdWNiNXIxTFFJZS11UklFa1hSQ1gxNDVHeVpJQ1Zzckw0dUJUQnFKS19rbk1yODc2SzJRekE00gFwQVVfeXFMT3BJRmtMcVVlR1pXME9XMnplaUNEMXdRZkowTGQyN3kxU2FnS2MyMmV2VEVvSEttbEhVVTRfbTF3ZDFqUFdlS3pmWWhaeHk5X19XSlphVXdpZ0ZWNzFyY29pVEplT0FDSWJQNzVpdDBEdw</guid></item><item><title>32岁的超级健康男子在服用流行药物后濒临死亡-专家警告更多健身房游客可能会b -每日邮报 | Ultra-fit man, 32, on the brink of death after taking popular medication - experts warn more gym-goers could b - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxPY0V2WG5rZG9UaG1TcUVFdmZGODU1czVwUUlDbjY0Q2FCRDlrSUt6d1c5UTV5ZXBvUUtFUVJIT0tsOG85eS1hZXJLV1pFNWExR0tHeFhiTmdkbERjbGFncGxOenpCbDc1YjBzV1FfSXhLMkJSdEJEdDV1MjVwU1BsSjZBTE1pUlI2M2JDMmxfTmYydDlyeHZHU3JvNjNveUtGOE5ZVWZLb9IBrAFBVV95cUxONXlFd0VWYnRzc3R0a29wbjJiOXNXMU15R1FDSlF5M1FFS3JaR3ljN1Z2T3pLeWQtQlVnR3EwUDdZQWdQY051eTIya1QtWDZSdW9mdktvWUQ2Ym9ZaVVvMVFSVkEzb1c0ZXZzOUNvbzh0OEg2M1hrOVVnYXJWaHl3TGozTG9XeDZIOHg4TFZuMDloa1JiakdvQVY2RGVJOE1HN2dCaGdDU3ZVemJJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A bodybuilder was left fighting for his life after abusing a drug which experts warn more young men are turning to, unaware of its devastating side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zak Wilkinson, 32, spent more than two years using steroids, splashing £35,000 on the performance enhancing drugs, injecting himself up to three times daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The avid gym goer, like a growing number of young men, turned to anabolic steroids, a type of image and performance drug taken, to increase his muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drugs mimic testosterone – one of the hormones responsible for boosting muscle mass – but can have devastating side effects, including an increased risk of suffering a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And experts warn there has been a concerning rise in their use fuelled by social media triggering body image issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Mr Wilkinson hopes to do his part in raising the alarm about the potentially life changing effects of the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On March 23 2022, the father of one's gruelling steroid regime finally caught up with him when he started having seizures, vomiting and sweating profusely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mr Wilkinson was placed in a medically induced coma after suffering the side effects of years of steroid use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The father of one said he had been using the drugs since the age of 16 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was rushed to intensive care unit at James Cook University Hospital, in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, after his sister, Chelsea Wilkinson, 37, called an ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At first, doctors thought he could be suffering from meningitis, but quickly realised the fits were caused by his steroid use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors said Mr Wilkinson was fortunate to avoid suffering long term neurological damage after being left non-verbal for days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was put into a medically-induced coma for a week, with his medical team saying it was a 'miracle' he survived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Wilkinson, a scaffolder, said: 'I thought I'd never be able to play with my son again, that I'd never see him again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'After the coma had ended, one doctor said that he couldn't believe I was speaking with him because he thought I'd have brain complications for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was so frightened that that could be the end of me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Wilkinson said steroids had 'just got hold of him' and warned that gym goers need to be aware of the risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The bodybuilder says his body dysmorphia led to him turning to the drugs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was an all or nothing approach - it's frightening. It just gets hold of you. I thought I was the fittest, strongest, healthiest person, but on the inside I wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's sad because I see a lot of young lads becoming affected by it. And that's why a lot of the bodybuilders are dying prematurely, because it's not healthy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have warned Mr Wilkinson that he will likely have medical issues for the rest of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He has a meeting with his treatment team twice a week, and also has to take anxiety, sleeping, and epilepsy medication, as well as attend frequent appointments for brain scans and blood tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It could still all affect me later on, and I'm probably going to be on constant medication for the rest of my life,' says Mr Wilkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I now have PTSD, body dysmorphia, a diagnosed eating disorder, regular flashbacks, and I'm having rehabilitation for trauma. I've also now become epileptic due to the coma.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anabolic-androgenic steroids are the most common type of 'image and performance enhancing drug'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are typically injected directly into the muscle, though can also be taken orally in tablet form or even as a cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors have said that he will likely suffer lifelong health implications from steroid use &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anabolic-androgenic steroids work by mimicking the effects of the male sex hormone testosterone, tricking the body into producing more muscular tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this comes at a cost. Common side effects include: severe acne, kidney failure, high cholesterol and even stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A landmark study published last year by Danish researchers found steroid users have an &lt;span&gt;almost 300 per cent increased risk of death within two decades.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Adam Taylor, an expert in anatomy at Lancaster University said: ‘The growth in people self prescribing steroids for performance reasons is of real concern.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There is a danger of suffering serious side effects if you are using these drugs, from heart attacks, and brain damage to long term mobility issues.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Cases like this show the danger of anabolic steroids, and people need to be aware of the consequences when they see people promoting the drugs on their social media feeds.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Wilkinson said he started taking steroids at 16 after struggling with body dysmorphia - a mental health condition where a person spends a lot of time worrying about perceived flaws in their appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'The drugs were very accessible and I was weighing everything - even down to the sugar-free syrups in my coffees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It started as a hobby and then it became body dysmorphia. I could barely look in the mirror, and I would put jumpers and hoodies on to avoid showing my body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And that explains the tattoos. I'm so body conscious. I've tried every diet out there, I've tried protein diet, meat and eggs diet, weight loss diets, the lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's because social media creates competition and you're constantly comparing yourself to others and looking at others trying to emulate them. It's a vicious circle.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts warn that steroid use is on the rise in young men fuelled by social media.

I was just striving for perfection in the bodybuilding game when everything around me was falling apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My family nearly lost someone who was important in their lives - it was a tough time for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's a real taboo around men and steroid use. There's AA for alcoholics, GA for gamblers, but not really a lot on steroid use and the gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I want to show people who are struggling what I've been through, that these muscles are not worth the comas, seizures, constant brain scans, tubes out your mouth, possibly losing a member of your family - all because you want to look good and compare yourself on social media.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gen Z has finally passed the avocado toast and pushed the dangerously low-calorie “Girl Dinner” trend to the sidelines. Protein is having a cultural moment, and macros matter most.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever opened TikTok, there’s a good chance you’ve encountered a fitness influencer filming a “&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/whatieatinaday?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;What I eat in a day&lt;/a&gt;” or attempting the somewhat more difficult “&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/100g-of-protein?lang=en"&gt;100 grams of protein daily&lt;/a&gt;” challenge. The new wellness routine seems to shift the focus from getting skinny to getting strong. But, it comes at a price — expensive meals and hours of meal-prepping.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Protein vloggers often break down their favorite smoothies, packed with &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/article/best-protein-powder-according-to-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;powders&lt;/a&gt;, Greek yogurt, and fiberous fruits and veggies. For lunch, they’ll opt for grilled chicken, ground turkey bowls, maybe some eggs for good measure. Vegetarians and vegans chime in with their versions, swapping the carnivorous assortment for beans, tofu, and chickpeas. For dessert? Maybe they’ll indulge in a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/article/best-protein-bars-according-to-dietitians/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;protein bar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, there was Patrick Schwarzenegger’s infamous “White Lotus” character obsessing over his protein intake and his brother’s &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/09/entertainment/coffee-mate-responds-to-being-roped-into-white-lotus-finale-death-plot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;near-fatal episode&lt;/a&gt; with his beloved &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/article/best-blenders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;blender&lt;/a&gt;. Protein, in a sense, has become a bonding ritual for health-conscious people, the spotlight being on young men looking to “make gains” and Gen Z women concerned about their iron levels. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;But, experts also suggest that there’s some real weight behind the push for more protein. The key is finding out how much protein you actually need.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

The answer… We still haven’t found the upper limit 🚀 For as long as gym bros have walked the earth, the myth that your body can only “use” 20–30g of protein in one meal has been by their side But over time, as researchers have actually tested this, that number has never held up👨🏼‍🔬 In one of the more recent studies done on this topic, 100g of protein in one sitting STILL increased muscle protein synthisis a LOT more than just 40g (study linked below📑) And a lot of the time when you compare groups of people who either eat all of their protein in one to two big meals vs. people who spead their protein out through the day—they both see nearly identical progress in terms of muscle Now—could there be a small benefit to spreading your protein out more evenly?  Yeah… but emphasis on *small*🤏🏼 If you’re really trying to squeeze an extra few percent out of the effect protein has on your body, are training twice a day, or eating a LOT of protein daily, it can give you a tiny boost  But for most people? Just hitting your total protein target each day will get you 95% of the way there So if you’re stressing about the “perfect” protein timing… don’t.  Just eat enough, consistently—and everything will work out 🤜🏼🤛🏼 Studies referenced: PMID: 38118410 PMID: 27511985 PMID: 19776143 PMID: 17413096 &lt;a title="protein" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/protein?refer=embed"&gt;#protein&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="fittok" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fittok?refer=embed"&gt;#fittok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="gymtok" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/gymtok?refer=embed"&gt;#gymtok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="gym" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/gym?refer=embed"&gt;#gym&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Tony" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7491302759002557230?refer=embed"&gt;♬ original sound – Tony&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;According to Katelyn Bedford, Holistic Nutritionist and founder of Wellness the Right Way, some social media theories on protein intake are backed by science, but others find themselves at the center of debate. She cites discussions on &lt;a href="https://visit.ws/g/b5dI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;clean protein&lt;/a&gt;, protein supplements, the whey versus plant protein debate, and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/health/best-collagen-supplements-per-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;collagen&lt;/a&gt;, of course. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Social media has evolved to more science-backed tips,” Bedford explained. “There’s an increased focus on longevity and aging well, and protein plays a central role in preserving lean mass.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bedford noted that the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/when-it-comes-to-protein-how-much-is-too-much#:~:text=The%20ideal%20amount%20of%20protein,of%20cereal%20with%20skim%20milk." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Recommended Dietary Allowance&lt;/a&gt; (RDA) for protein is 46 grams per day for women and 56 for men. However, these are only minimums to avoid deficiency, and not an optimal target for people who are working out frequently. For those looking to build muscle mass, Bedford suggests an optimal target of 0.8 to 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research seems to support what Bedford and other health influencers have recommended.  A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38118410/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;health study&lt;/a&gt; published in the National Library of Medicine in 2023 demonstrated how individuals who consumed 100 grams of protein achieved a greater anabolic response and better protein synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If building muscle is the ultimate goal, Bedford suggests supplementing a protein-packed whole food diet with some high-quality protein snacks, powders, or drinks, which can make it easier to up your intake. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;








&lt;p&gt;The protein market is flooded with all sorts of products, from &lt;a href="https://visit.ws/g/b5dI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;plant-based creamers&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a data-aps-asc-tag="nypost-20" data-aps-asin="B00K6JUG4K" data-wrapped-template="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url" href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB00K6JUG4K%3Ftag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2025%2F05%2F15%2Fhealth%2Fbest-products-you-can-use-to-achieve-your-daily-protein-goals%2F%26asc_source%3Dweb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;celebrity-backed powders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-aps-asc-tag="nypost-20" data-aps-asin="B0DP5JZ8RT" data-wrapped-template="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url" href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDavid-Protein-Variety-Calories-Sugar%2Fdp%2FB0DP5JZ8RT%3Ftag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2025%2F05%2F15%2Fhealth%2Fbest-products-you-can-use-to-achieve-your-daily-protein-goals%2F%26asc_source%3Dweb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;bars&lt;/a&gt; that claim to provide the most effective portable protein on this planet. The challenge is determining which ones are safe, healthy, and effective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bedford has a few recommendations for her clients focused on building muscle. She tells them to look for products that are third-party tested, use minimally processed sources of protein, and are made without additives or artificial ingredients like high fructose corn syrup. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s best to avoid protein powders packed with ingredients you can’t pronounce,” she suggested. “At the end of the day, protein is essential-but it’s not a magic bullet. It’s one piece of the nutrition puzzle, and quality, balance, and personalization matter most.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A formula backed by Jennifer Aniston and over 200,00 Amazon reviews&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Solid protein count per serving (18 grams)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Offers skin, hair, and nail support on top of protein benefits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not contain a scoop, so it’s important to measure out your dose carefully&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Backed by over 200,000 reviews on Amazon, Vital Protein’s new advanced Collagen Peptides powder does offer a solid dose of protein, sourced from grass-fed, pasture-raised bovine, making it a wonderful paleo-friendly option for those seeking benefits for skin, hair, nails, and muscle strength. The one downside to this brand is that you’re going to have to carefully measure it out yourself. The new packaging does not contain a scoop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grams of protein per &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;serving:&lt;/strong&gt; 18&lt;/span&gt; grams&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barebells quickly took off after hitting the shelves at Trader Joe’s, and their popularity continues to soar on TikTok. The creamy nougat top layer gives this bar a candy-like texture, and the chocolate is creamy without any semblance of some of the waxier coatings associated with protein bars. With 20 grams of protein, these bars are ideal for anyone who wants to up their intake while on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tasty, crunchy, and delicious for breakfast or a snack on the go&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Good source of fiber as well as protein&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Zero sugar and diabetic-friendly&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Different flavor options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher price-point, and each bag contains only seven servings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fuel up in the morning with a tasty cereal that packs in the protein. Catalina Crunch is loaded with 11 grams of protein, plenty of fiber, and wholesome ingredients like cinnamon, sea salt, and sunflower oil, which makes it a great option for people who need to kick their cravings while upping their intake. It’s also worth noting that the brand was founded by a diabetic, so the recipe is a great option for those following a lower-sugar diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grams of protein per serving:&lt;/strong&gt; 11 grams&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extra high dose of protein per two-scoop serving (25 grams)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Plant-based combination, also filled with fiber, veggies, adaptogens, and prebiotics&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Backed by thousands of reviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More expensive than some other lower-quality protein bars, but a great investment for those sticking to a plant-based diet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ka’Chava offers 25 grams of protein per two-scoop serving, all coming from a blend of pea protein, brown rice, sacha inchi, quinoa, and amaranth. This plant-based protein combination not only gives the necessary amino acids for muscle gains but is also filled with fiber, a host of B vitamins, veggies, and adaptogens like organic maca root and cordyceps mushroom mycelia. If that wasn’t enough, it also has pre- and probiotics to aid gut health. Best of all, it’s delicious and backed by thousands of reviews. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grams of protein per serving:&lt;/strong&gt; 25 grams&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An extra high dose of protein (28 grams) and all 20 amino acids&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Low-calorie and sugar-free&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;TikTok-famous and well-received&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Easy to take on the go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower-calorie, so not to be treated as a meal replacement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;David bars have been all over TikTok, and the ingredients seem to stack up — with such a high amount of protein (28 grams), all your daily amino acids, and a decadent flavor profile, they’re a fantastic choice for anyone looking to meet their protein goals efficiently. The bars are also formulated to provide a high protein-to-calorie ratio, and at just 150 calories per bar, you won’t bite much into your daily allowance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grams of protein per serving:&lt;/strong&gt; 28 grams&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Plant-based protein with a lower-carb count&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some reviewers mention they are a bit dry and can crumble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dubbed a plant-based protein powerhouse, these dry-roasted edanamae beans are a delicious, high-fiber, keto-friendly, protein-packed snack, without all the additives you find in processed powders or bars. They’re also incredibly convenient and come in a re-sealable bag, so you can throw them in the car or your bag in case you need a little afternoon pick-me-up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yummy, kid-friendly flavors&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Baked not fired&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Perfectly portioned pouches make snacking easy from anywhere&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Free from artificial flavors, high fructose corn syrup, etc. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower protein count than other protein snacks, but a good choice for kids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The kids need protein too, and Kindling Protein Pretzels happen to be the perfect way to get it. These crunchy pretzels are made with whole grain flour, wheat protein isolate, chickpea protein, plus sunflower oil, and sea salt to taste. They’re served in perfectly portioned punches and offered in a number of bold flavors suited for tiny tastebuds. Baked, not fried, and low in sugar, they’re a solid protein snack and still picky-easter approved. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grams of protein per serving:&lt;/strong&gt; 8-9 grams&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pull pack comes with a supply of different flavors (they also make a good classroom snack)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sourced from 100% lean cuts of beef&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Made with a blend of spices and slow-cooked over hardwood smoke for a classic taste&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bit high on the sodium (690 mg)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Texture can be on the chewy side, per reviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lean meat is a wonderful source of protein, and Jack Links 100% beef jerky strives to deliver just that. These portable packs offer 13 grams per serving and are bursting with flavor, according to some of the thousands of reviews. It’s worth noting that they’re a bit high on the sodium side, but don’t let that deter you from trying them out — they’re delicious and nutritious.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grams of protein per serving:&lt;/strong&gt; 13 grams&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Protein FAQS&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Post consulted Katelyn Bedford, a Holistic Nutritionist and founder of &lt;a href="https://wellnesstherightway.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Wellness the Right Way,&lt;/a&gt; for insight on protein consumption and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why do you need high-quality protein?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Consuming an adequate amount of protein is essential for many reasons, as it supports virtually every system in the body,” Bedford suggested. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Protein supports muscle maintenance and growth, is essential for enzyme and hormonal production, supports immune function, is needed for tissue repair and wound healing, regulates Fluid and pH balance, is a secondary energy source, and prevents malnutrition and muscle wasting.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What should you look for in protein snacks?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bedford has outlined a few things to look for in protein snacks, powders, and shakes:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for Ingredients you recognize (whey, pea protein, cocoa, dates, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Avoid artificial sweeteners like sucralose or aspartame, hydrogenated oils, or high-fructose corn syrup.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Aim for at least 10 to 20 grams of protein per serving.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Check to ensure the product has been third-party tested for quality and purity (NSF, Informed Sport, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Avoid long lists of unpronounceable additives, artificial dyes, or “proprietary blends.”&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How does age impact our protein needs?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As we age, we naturally lose muscle mass,” Bedfrod explained. “Starting around age 40, our bodies become less efficient at using protein to rebuild tissue.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bedford added that older adults may benefit from increasing their protein intake to around 1-1.2 grams per pound of ideal bodyweight, which should help them maintain their strength and mobility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Should you eat protein before or after a workout to maximize the benefits?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bedford believes that protein is beneficial when consumed before or after a workout. But, for most people, post-workout protein matters more. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“After strength training, your muscles are primed to absorb amino acids for repair and growth,” she explained. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She suggests aiming to get 15 to 30 grams of protein within an hour post-workout, ideally with some carbohydrates to replenish glycogen levels. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can you eat too much protein?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Bedford, more isn’t always better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While high-protein diets are generally safe for healthy individuals, excessive protein intake-especially when paired with low hydration-can strain kidneys, cause digestive discomfort, and lead to nutrient imbalances if you’re neglecting carbs or fats.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you are over-eating protein and not balancing it out, you may experience dehydration, constipation, bad breath, and potential kidney stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the researchers noted a “statistically significant reduction” in assessment scores across all measures of these common &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;symptoms of MS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[Ellagic acid] appears to significantly alleviate fatigue, depression, and anxiety in MS patients,” the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although larger studies are needed to confirm these findings, an &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2023.1238846/full"&gt;earlier analysis&lt;/a&gt; of this same triple-blind study showed that ellagic acid may reduce the levels of molecules that signal inflammation in MS, while increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory molecules. This would be expected to ease symptoms and slow progression of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20552173251331524"&gt;Ellagic acid favorable effects on fatigue, depression and anxiety in patients with multiple sclerosis and moderate disability: A randomized clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published in the &lt;em&gt;Multiple Sclerosis Journal — Experimental, Translational and Clinical&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Investigating ellagic acid supplements for use in MS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MS, the immune system mistakenly attacks &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/myelin-sheath/"&gt;myelin&lt;/a&gt;, a protective covering that surrounds nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. These inflammatory attacks cause a gradual buildup of damage, leading to worsening disability that typically affects a patient’s ability to function in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While mobility-related symptoms, such as stiffness and problems with balance and walking, are the most common, people with MS also can experience other issues — often fatigue and mental health problems. Such symptoms can be bothersome and take a toll on a patient’s quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In humans, the effects of … the demyelination process … in MS patients are known to cause the onset of psychological consequences of the disease, including depression, anxiety and fatigue,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many individuals with MS consider holistic management strategies that combine a &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/living-with-ms/ms-diet-nutrition/healthy-eating-ms/"&gt;healthy diet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-and-exercise/"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/expert-voices/2022/01/12/expert-voices-complementary-alternative-medicine-ms/"&gt;complementary treatments&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the use of &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/approved-treatments-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;approved medication&lt;/a&gt;. One &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2021/12/30/vitamin-d-supplements-may-improve-ms-quality-life/"&gt;supplement&lt;/a&gt; that’s sometimes considered is vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the team of researchers sought to learn more about the effects of ellagic acid, or EA, supplements. Ellagic acid is found in certain fruits and seeds, like raspberries, strawberries, red grapes, pomegranates, almonds, and walnuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“On the basis of animal models and laboratory studies, EA has been identified as an effective substance for treating chronic diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies in mouse models of MS showed that ellagic acid may help reduce inflammation and ease symptoms of the disease. However, no studies have examined the effects of ellagic acid supplements in people with MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this study, the team recruited 58 adults, ages 18 to 55, who had been &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis/"&gt;diagnosed with MS&lt;/a&gt; for at least six months. Their scores on the &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-prognosis-life-expectancy/#MS_Progression"&gt;Expanded Disability Status Scale&lt;/a&gt; (EDSS), a commonly used measure, ranged from 4.5 to 5.5 points, indicating significant disability with minor limitations in daily activities to disability severe enough to prevent some daily activities from being done independently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Disability levels seen to decrease significantly with one dose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants were randomly assigned to receive either ellagic acid — two capsules taken with meals, totaling 180 mg daily — or a placebo, while maintaining their usual diet and physical activity patterns. The researchers called or texted participants to help them stick to the schedule. At the end of the study, leftover capsules were counted to determine compliance with the treatment protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After three months, the EDSS scores of patients on ellagic acid had decreased significantly, by an average of 1.01 points, indicating a lower disability level. For those on the placebo, there was no significant change in their EDSS score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;We found a statistically significant reduction in [assessment] scores compared to the control group. … The changes achieved are also clinically significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, patients on ellagic acid showed a significant reduction in anxiety, depression, and fatigue after three months, while these symptoms remained virtually unchanged in the placebo group. Similar results were observed for physical, psychosocial, and cognitive fatigue scores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We found a statistically significant reduction in [assessment] scores compared to the control group,” the researchers wrote, adding that “the changes achieved are also clinically significant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that their study “is the first to investigate the effects of EA … on psychological impairments such as anxiety, fatigue and depression in MS patients.” As a study limitation, however, team noted that only a single dose of the supplement was given. Further, the trial was very small in size. I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Although additional investigations are needed to determine how to [ease] psychological symptoms in MS patients, mechanisms such as the anti-inflammatory properties of [ellagic acid] can be considered,” the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Multiple Sclerosis News Today</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 13:12:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxOY0QxbTc4cGlWVlhVLV9FZmgwdjllR2phSlNJVUo2c0hWM2dqY29xTkgzZTZCNW9NMGdGa2ktSTdHcHhpaXJwR2JKdU9WNncyZDVWbUVpczJ6dXRHZ0lydk1XczJTYzFoSlpEOEtFaE12QTFVX3I4TEFNN0txZjNMNlJpV3dNUmRTdDJPdGdsNmJFc2dNRG9EeFJCMmJtbHplVS0wRl9QeWZQZ2pSMjlPNHZvWmRsVkFNb09pSg</guid></item><item><title>即使您锻炼身体，每天坐上几个小时也会缩小您的大脑- Earth.com | Sitting for hours daily shrinks your brain, even if you exercise - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQVDRIY0ZQellWb3RkXzZ3NTJRd2FpT2VRcVU2WkluYXNfVmlUTjgzczR3MG5qMDQxSGtyY25fQXF3OFlWcGsyOGFFeG5jNF82RHJ6TC01cDJ5cHF2VWtaNjdtbmlqNUZVR3Z2Zy1TR3JqcXc0QlZYcjZOUGgxS0s4V1owZDdMTG9Nd3hZSkFrbnhDRUJzOHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine spending hours on the couch, feeling good about the morning’s workout. You ran, you lifted, you stretched. You believe you’ve done enough to protect your health. But new research says that may not be true. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting for extended periods, regardless of exercise, can harm the brain. Even the most active older adults face the risk of faster brain shrinkage if they sit too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by researchers from &lt;a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/a&gt;’s Memory and Alzheimer’s Center, tracked older adults for seven years. They examined how long participants sat, how often they moved, and how much their brains shrank over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were troubling. Exercise didn’t fully counteract the effects of prolonged &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sedentary-behavior-sitting-for-hours-health-risk-early-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sitting&lt;/a&gt;. The more hours spent sitting, the greater the brain decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sitting-for-hours-shrinks-the-brain"&gt;Sitting for hours shrinks the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed that even those who exercised for 150 minutes a week still experienced brain shrinkage if they sat for long hours. Memory declined, and the hippocampus lost volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants wore wrist monitors that tracked every move. On average, they sat for 13 hours a day. That’s a lot of time spent sitting – at the desk, on the couch, in the car. And it took a toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who sat more had thinner brains in areas linked to memory and Alzheimer’s disease. Reducing &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sitting-too-much-can-cause-premature-aging-even-if-you-exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sitting&lt;/a&gt; time might help protect brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genetic-risk-and-sitting"&gt;Genetic risk and sitting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sitting-too-much-can-raise-blood-pressure-even-in-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sitting&lt;/a&gt; is bad enough. But for those carrying the APOE-ε4 gene, it’s worse. This gene already raises the risk of Alzheimer’s. The researchers found that it also amplifies the impact of sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who carry the APOE-ε4 gene lost more gray matter in specific parts of the brain. These areas include the frontal and parietal lobes, which are important for making decisions and remembering information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because these brain regions became smaller, APOE-ε4 carriers had more trouble with memory tasks. They couldn’t remember words as easily as others. They also found it harder to name objects quickly. The damage in these brain areas made simple memory tasks more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-sitting-hurts-the-brain"&gt;Why sitting hurts the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you sit for a long time, blood flow to the brain slows down. This means the brain gets less oxygen and fewer nutrients, which are essential for keeping brain cells healthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With less blood flow, the brain struggles to maintain strong connections between its cells. Over time, this can cause the hippocampus – the part of the brain that manages memory – to shrink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/walking-can-counteract-the-health-risks-of-sitting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sitting&lt;/a&gt; can also lead to more inflammation in the body. Inflammation involves chemicals that can harm brain cells. For people with the APOE-ε4 gene, which is linked to Alzheimer’s, this inflammation could cause even more damage to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sitting-and-brain-decline"&gt;Sitting and brain decline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study didn’t just look at brain volume once. It tracked changes over seven years. The findings were clear. More sitting meant faster brain shrinkage, especially in those with genetic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants sat for an average of 13 hours a day. Even those who exercised regularly couldn’t escape the damage. They still lost brain volume in areas tied to memory, language, and processing speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exercise-can-t-erase-the-damage"&gt;Exercise can’t erase the damage &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can’t undo hours of sitting with a morning run – the study made that clear. Exercise helps, but it doesn’t erase the damage from hours of inactivity. Movement throughout the day matters more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers suggest breaking up sitting time with frequent walks, stretches, or standing breaks. Stand during phone calls. Walk around while reading emails. The brain needs regular movement to stay healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sitting-brain-size-and-health"&gt;Sitting, brain size, and health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also used wrist monitors to measure real movement – not self-reported activity. Participants wore them for seven days, 24 hours a day. The data was precise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MRI scans provided another layer of insight. The experts measured cortical thickness in regions linked to Alzheimer’s. They tracked changes in brain volume over time, focusing on the hippocampus, frontal lobe, and parietal lobe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-memory-loss-and-language-decline"&gt;Memory loss and language decline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings weren’t just about brain volume. They were about memory too. Those who sat more performed worse on naming tasks. They couldn’t recall names or objects as quickly. They struggled to remember words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For APOE-ε4 carriers, the decline was steeper. As discussed above, they lost brain volume faster and showed more severe memory loss. The researchers believe sitting speeds up age-related brain changes in those already at genetic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sitting-less-protects-the-brain"&gt;Sitting less protects the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting for long hours can damage the brain, especially in older adults. Even if you exercise, the harm from sitting too much doesn’t go away. You need to keep moving throughout the day to protect your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people sit for around nine hours a day. In the study, people sat for 13 hours daily. Cutting down on sitting time can help prevent brain damage.

By pairing a neutral sound and image, then associating the image with an unpleasant experience, researchers showed that rats later feared the sound alone—demonstrating inferred emotional learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) played a key role in this process by tagging neurons during sensory pairing and activating them during emotional learning. Blocking mPFC activity disrupted this inference, while direct memory associations remained intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher-Order Emotion:&lt;/strong&gt; Rats can infer fear from indirect associations, not just direct experiences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mPFC Role:&lt;/strong&gt; The medial prefrontal cortex enables inference by linking neutral stimuli to aversive outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may help unravel mechanisms behind human anxiety and trauma-related disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;RIKEN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xiaowei Gu and Joshua Johansen at the RIKEN Center for Brain Science in Japan have discovered key circuitry in the rat brain that allows the learning of inferred emotions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study reveals how the frontal part of the brain coordinates with the amygdala—a brain region important for simple forms of emotional learning—to make this higher-order emotional ability possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109938"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce.jpg" alt="This shows a woman's head and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/fear-inference-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Blocking the output from the mPFC to the amygdala during the test phase also prevented rats from responding to the noise with fear. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the scientific journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; on May 14, this breakthrough study is the first to show how the brain codes human-like internal models of emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are inferred emotions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider a child who often watches a wasp fly in and out of its nest in the woods near her house. One day the child is stung by the wasp for the first time, a frightening experience that changes her emotional response to this creature but also to the nest itself. Afterward, seeing the wasp’s nest alone makes the child feel anxious and become alert and cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, the child has built an internal model that links the negative experience with the visual representation of the nest – even though the nest was not there at the time of the fearful event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johansen and Gu were interested in understanding the neural mechanisms that allow this type of higher-order emotional processing through inference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do so, they created a similar situation in animals; rats learned a neutral association between a noise and an image, then later experienced unpleasantness while seeing the image—a process called aversive conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, they were tested to see if they could infer from hearing the noise alone that something unpleasant might happen. Under these conditions, rats did indeed freeze when they heard the noise, indicating their fear and showing that they too can learn inferred emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once they had a successful animal model, the researchers used a combination of calcium imaging and optogenetics to examine changes in neuron activity within a part of the brain called the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). As hypothesized, experiments indicated that the mPFC is the basis of emotional inference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before undergoing aversive conditioning, neurons in the mPFC responded similarly to both the image and the noise, whether the stimuli had been paired or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after aversive learning, calcium imaging showed that the number of noise-responsive and noise/image co-responsive neurons went way up— provided the noise and image had been initially paired together when presented to the animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further testing showed that this phenomenon was possible because the initial sensory pairing “tagged” co-responsive neurons, making them primed to activate during aversive conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optogenetically blocking the mPFC during the aversive learning stage prevented rats from being able to make the later inference. In this case because the image and the unpleasant experience, and indirectly the noise, could not properly become linked in the rats’ minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking the output from the mPFC to the amygdala during the test phase also prevented rats from responding to the noise with fear. However, in this case it was because they could not properly recall the inferred memory, even though the association had been made the day before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the rats had no problem freezing in response to the image, indicating that only the higher-order ability of inference is rooted in the physical changes that take place in mPFC neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Johansen explains, “decades of studying aversive learning in rodents has revealed that the amygdala is a critical site for storing simple emotional memories involving directly experienced associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, our new findings indicate that the mPFC is a central brain region for higher order human-like emotions, which involve internal models and inference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The value of our study,” says Johansen, “is that it opens the door for researchers everywhere to examine the neural mechanisms that mediate higher order emotions, which are more relevant to human psychiatric conditions like anxiety or trauma-related disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this fear and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d8b9bcb9b5f6a8b0b1b4b4b1a8ab98aab1b3bdb6f6b2a8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Adam Phillips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://riken.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RIKEN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Adam Phillips – RIKEN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09001-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prefrontal encoding of an internal model for emotional inference&lt;/a&gt;” by Joshua Johansen et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prefrontal encoding of an internal model for emotional inference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key function of brain systems mediating emotion is to learn to anticipate unpleasant experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although organisms readily associate sensory stimuli with aversive outcomes, higher-order forms of emotional learning and memory require inference to extrapolate the circumstances surrounding directly experienced aversive events to other indirectly related sensory patterns that were not part of the original experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of learning requires internal models of emotion, which flexibly track directly experienced and inferred aversive associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the brain mechanisms of simple forms of aversive learning have been well studied in areas such as the amygdala, whether and how the brain forms and represents internal models of emotionally relevant associations are not known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we report that neurons in the rodent dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) encode a flexible internal model of emotion by linking sensory stimuli in the environment with aversive events, whether they were directly or indirectly associated with that experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These representations form through a multi-step encoding mechanism involving recruitment and stabilization of dmPFC cells that support inference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although dmPFC population activity encodes all salient associations, dmPFC neurons projecting to the amygdala specifically represent and are required to express inferred associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings reveal how internal models of emotion are encoded in the dmPFC to regulate subcortical systems for recall of inferred emotional memories.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 12:57:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE53NmlKdzlNaWszNGNwMXItNzJIcDZJQ2w4VnhPQkJwcnZCRjZOaDd2SFBmZEsyazAxYXB3NDJ1TVFOcGo2ZEFjUWJiM0dnTDFvZmFWclowcEVWMFlSajZaTW9sUWl1cEViZ3ZQMDJKVXg</guid></item><item><title>一直都累吗？你可能患有鲜为人知的营养不足，警告专家-每日邮报 | Tired all the time?

However, animal sources tend to have much more, she warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One recent YouGov study found that one in eight people in the UK report feeling tired ‘all the time’ and a quarter of us are tired ‘most of the time’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There’s even a medical acronym for it: TATT or ‘tired all the time’. While it is estimated more than 400,000 people in the UK suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include waking up exhausted despite sleeping well, headaches, mood swings and lack of motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common causes can include iron deficiency, vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, diabetes and hypothyroidism, which is when the thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough hormones leading to slow metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another common cause may also be depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It is thought to be a reaction to a surge of stress hormones that can be caused by an emotionally or physically stressful event, such as the death of a loved one or a divorce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109934"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne.jpg" alt="This shows a heart with a crack in it." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Deaths were more than double in men at 11.2% compared to the rate of 5.5% among women. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can lead to severe, short-term failure of the heart muscle and can be fatal. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may be misdiagnosed as a heart attack because the symptoms and test results are similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is one of the largest to assess in-hospital death rates and complications of the condition, as well as differences by sex, age and race over five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find that the death rate from Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was relatively high without significant changes over the five-year study, and the rate of in-hospital complications also was elevated,” said study author M. Reza Movahed, M.D., Ph.D., an interventional cardiologist and clinical professor of medicine at the University of Arizona’s Sarver Heart Center in Tucson, Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The continued high death rate is alarming, suggesting that more research be done for better treatment and finding new therapeutic approaches to this condition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers reviewed health records in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database to identify people diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy from 2016 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The death rate was considered high at 6.5%, with no improvement over period.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deaths were more than double in men at 11.2% compared to the rate of 5.5% among women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Major complications included congestive heart failure (35.9%), atrial fibrillation (20.7%), cardiogenic shock (6.6%), stroke (5.3%) and cardiac arrest (3.4%).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People older than age 61 had the highest incidence rates of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. However, there was a 2.6 to 3.25 times higher incidence of this condition among adults ages 46-60 compared to those ages 31-45 during the study period.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;White adults had the highest rate of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (0.16%), followed by Native American adults (0.13%) and Black adults (0.07%).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In addition, socioeconomic factors, including median household income, hospital size and health insurance status, varied significantly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a serious condition with a substantial risk of death and severe complications,” Movahed said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The health care team needs to carefully review coronary angiograms that show no significant coronary disease with classic appearance of left ventricular motion, suggesting any subtypes of stress-induced cardiomyopathy. These patients should be monitored for serious complications and treated promptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some complications, such as embolic stroke, may be preventable with an early initiation of anti-clotting medications in patients with a substantially weakened heart muscle or with an irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation that increases the risk of stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also noted that age-related findings could serve as a useful diagnostic tool in discriminating between heart attack/chest pain and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which may prompt earlier diagnosis of the condition and could also remove assumptions that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy only occurs in the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the study’s limitations is that it relied on data from hospital codes, which could have errors or overcount patients hospitalized more than once or transferred to another hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, there was no information on outpatient data, different types of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or other conditions that may have contributed to patients’ deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Movahed said further research is needed about the management of patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and the reason behind differences in death rates between men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study details, background and design:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The analysis included 199,890 U.S. adults from across the nation (average age 67; 83% of cases were among women). White adults comprised 80% of the Takotsubo cardiomyopathy patients, while 8% were Black adults, 6% were Hispanic adults, 2% were Asian/Pacific Islander adults, 0.64% were Native American adults and 2.2% were reported as Other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database is the largest publicly available source detailing publicly and privately paid hospital care in the U.S.  It produces estimates of inpatient utilization, access, cost, quality and outcomes for about 35 million hospitalizations nationally annually.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-authors, disclosures and funding sources are listed in the manuscript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this cardiovascular disease and mortality research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3b7949525f5c5e4f4f5e157658755e5257577b535e5a494f1554495c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bridgette McNeill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://heart.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Bridgette McNeill – American Heart Association&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.037219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;High Mortality and Complications in Patients Admitted With Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy With More Than Double Mortality in Men Without Improvement in Outcome Over the Years&lt;/a&gt;” by M.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the outcome data of patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy using a large inpatient database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods and Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database for our study. We evaluated trends, mortality, and complications of patients admitted with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy from available years 2016 to 2020 in adults &amp;gt;18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 199 890 patients with Takotsubo were found in our database with 83% being female and higher prevalence with age, White race, and highest income. Mortality was high at 6.5% with no significant improvement over the years studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, major complications were substantial. Cardiogenic shock occurred in 6.6%, atrial fibrillation in 20.7%, cardiac arrest in 3.4%, congestive heart failure in 35.9%, and stroke in 5.3%. Mortality was more than double in men in comparison to women (11.2% versus 5.5%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is associated with high mortality and complications with no improvement in outcome over the 5‐year study with higher mortality in men. Further improvement in care is needed to improve outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 12:26:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1WbVZ2M283dm9HX1pXMjF1WEFYdVZhMm9IS1IydzVHVmtCcjJmT3NRei13b1lRN0xidm1PRGZDSzV2TTM0MTIzeUc4aXRNWVlxcnJld3dmSlJjVENCSmZUUDdMVXNnMW14NlBuSHhHcHNXUE5Ba0E</guid></item><item><title>代数不仅仅是字母汤–它是算法和关系的语言-对话 | Algebra is more than alphabet soup – it’s the language of algorithms and relationships - The Conversation</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxNRlhUNHNIYlpEQ3YtT1lTemczWkNaQjRONU0xQk1yWllKaWp4b3JPTThZdXJ3cmVVVlU1TnFoSV94bW9wcjRodlVVN2NvZUxUZE1zbUhoV2oxeFhmTklCajMzVmU0YjI4ajN4RjloSEhuMDdleWhTX1pZR1NYREU0RzFRLU9nekFkVkVENHUyUU1YLXpyOFJqODQ3ZzBsT0tfZWE0ZmNfWDdVbXViNl81WUJaX0c5U2hvOXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You scrambled up a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW2Hvs5WaRY&amp;amp;ab_channel=TED-Ed"&gt;Rubik’s cube&lt;/a&gt;, and now you want to put it back in order. What sequence of moves should you make?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprise: You can answer this question with &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/modern-algebra"&gt;modern algebra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most folks who have been through high school mathematics courses will have taken a class called algebra – maybe even a sequence of classes called algebra I and algebra II that asked you to &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/x-marks-the-unknown-in-algebra-but-xs-origins-are-a-math-mystery-210440"&gt;solve for &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The word “algebra” may evoke memories of complicated-looking polynomial equations like &lt;em&gt;ax²&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;bx&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; = 0 or plots of polynomial functions like &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;ax²&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;bx&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might remember learning about the quadratic formula to figure out the solutions to these equations and find where the plot crosses the &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;-axis, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/668020/original/file-20250514-62-ogszr5.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Graph of a quadratic equation and its roots via the quadratic formula.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Roots_of_a_quadratic_function_via_the_quadratic_formula.png"&gt;Jacob Rus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equations and plots like these are part of algebra, but they’re not the whole story. What unifies algebra is the practice of studying things – like the moves you can make on a Rubik’s cube or the numbers on a clock face you use to tell time – and the way they behave when you put them together in different ways. What happens when you string together the Rubik’s cube moves or add up numbers on a clock? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my work &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=mfTZ8K4AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;as a mathematician&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve learned that many algebra questions come down to classifying objects by their similarities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sets and groups&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did equations like &lt;em&gt;ax²&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;bx&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; = 0 and their solutions lead to abstract algebra?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short version of the story is that mathematicians found formulas that looked a lot like the quadratic formula for polynomial equations where the highest power of &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; was three or four. But they couldn’t do it for five. It took mathematician &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Evariste-Galois"&gt;Évariste Galois&lt;/a&gt; and techniques he developed – now called &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/%7Eucahmto/0007/_book/4-groups.html"&gt;group theory&lt;/a&gt; – to make a convincing argument that no such formula could exist for polynomials with a highest power of five or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is a group, anyway? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It starts with &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/set-mathematics-and-logic"&gt;a set&lt;/a&gt;, which is a collection of things. The fruit bowl in my kitchen is a set, and the collection of things in it are pieces of fruit. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 also form a set. Sets on their own don’t have too many properties – that is, characteristics – but if we start doing things to the numbers 1 through 12, or the fruit in the fruit bowl, it gets more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-left zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/667696/original/file-20250513-56-f2gv1j.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;In clock addition, 3 + 12 = 3.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://openstax.org/books/contemporary-mathematics/pages/3-7-clock-arithmetic"&gt;OpenStax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s call this set of numbers 1 through 12 “clock numbers.” Then, we can define an addition function for the clock numbers using the way we tell time. That is, to say “3 + 11 = 2” is the way we would add 3 and 11. It feels weird, but if you think about it, 11 hours past 3 o'clock is 2 o'clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clock addition has some nice properties. It satisfies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;closure&lt;/em&gt;, where adding things in the set gives you something else in the set,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt;, where there’s an element that doesn’t change the value of other elements in the set when added – adding 12 to any number will equal that same number,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;associativity&lt;/em&gt;, where you can add wherever you want in the set,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;inverses&lt;/em&gt;, where you can undo whatever an element does, and &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;commutativity&lt;/em&gt;, where you can change the order of which clock numbers you add up without changing the outcome: &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By satisfying all these properties, mathematicians can consider clock numbers with clock addition &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/group-theory"&gt;a group&lt;/a&gt;. In short, a group is a set with some way of combining the elements layered on top. The set of fruit in my fruit bowl probably can’t be made into a group easily – what’s a banana plus an apple? But we can make a set of clock numbers into a group by showing that clock addition is a way of taking two clock numbers and getting to a new one that satisfies the rules outlined above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rings and fields&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with groups, the two other &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/modern-algebra"&gt;fundamental types of algebraic objects&lt;/a&gt; you would study in an introduction to modern algebra are rings and fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could introduce a second operation for the clock numbers: clock multiplication, where 2 times 7 is 2, because 14 o'clock is the same as 2 o'clock. With clock addition and clock multiplication, the clock numbers meet the criteria for what mathematicians call &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ring-mathematics#ref894211"&gt;a ring&lt;/a&gt;. This is primarily because clock multiplication and clock addition together satisfy a key component that defines a ring: the distributive property, where &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;) = &lt;em&gt;ab&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;ac&lt;/em&gt;. Lastly, &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/modern-algebra#ref790511"&gt;fields&lt;/a&gt; are rings that satisfy even more conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the turn of the 20th century, mathematicians &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/David-Hilbert"&gt;David Hilbert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/emmy-noether-faced-sexism-and-nazism-over-100-years-later-her-contributions-to-ring-theory-still-influence-modern-math-163245"&gt;Emmy Noether&lt;/a&gt; – who were interested in understanding how the principles in Einstein’s &lt;a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/how-mathematician-emmy-noethers-theorem-changed-physics"&gt;relativity worked mathematically&lt;/a&gt; – unified algebra and showed the utility of studying groups, rings and fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;It’s all fun and games until you do the math&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Groups, rings and fields are abstract, but they have many useful applications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the symmetries of molecular structures are categorized by different &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/point-group"&gt;point groups&lt;/a&gt;. A point group describes ways to move a molecule in space so that even if you move the individual atoms, the end result is indistinguishable from the molecule you started with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/668016/original/file-20250514-56-uhpqp0.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The water molecule H₂O can be flipped horizontally and the end result is indistinguishable from the original position.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;Courtney Gibbons&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let’s take a different example that uses rings instead of groups. You can set up a pretty complicated set of equations to &lt;a href="https://mathvoices.ams.org/featurecolumn/2022/08/01/applied-algebra-a-variety-show/"&gt;describe a Sudoku puzzle&lt;/a&gt;: You need 81 variables to represent each place you can put a number in the grid, polynomial expressions to encode the rules of the game, and polynomial expressions that take into account the clues already on the board. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the spaces on the game board and the 81 variables to correspond nicely, you can use two subscripts to associate the variable with a specific place on the board, like using &lt;em&gt;x₃₅&lt;/em&gt; to represent the cell in the third row and fifth column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first entry must be one of the numbers 1 through 9, and we represent that relationship with (&lt;em&gt;x₁₁&lt;/em&gt; - 1)(&lt;em&gt;x₁₁&lt;/em&gt; - 2)(&lt;em&gt;x₁₁&lt;/em&gt; - 3) ⋅⋅⋅ (&lt;em&gt;x₁₁&lt;/em&gt; - 9). This expression is equal to zero if and only if you followed the rules of the game. Since every space on the board follows this rule, that’s already 81 equations just to say, “Don’t plug in anything other than 1 through 9.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule “1 through 9 each appear exactly once in the top row” can be captured with some sneaky pieces of algebraic thinking. The sum of the top row is going to add up to 45, which is to say &lt;em&gt;x₁₁&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;x₁₂&lt;/em&gt; + ⋅⋅⋅ + &lt;em&gt;x₁₉&lt;/em&gt; - 45 will be zero, and the product of the top row is going to be the product of 1 through 9, which is to say &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;₁₁ &lt;em&gt;x₁₂&lt;/em&gt; ⋅⋅⋅ &lt;em&gt;x₁₉&lt;/em&gt; - 9⋅8⋅7⋅6⋅5⋅4⋅3⋅2⋅1 will be zero. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking that it takes more time to set up all these rules than it does to solve the puzzle, you’re not wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Turning Sudoku into algebra takes a fair bit of work.&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do we get by doing this complicated translation into algebra? Well, we get to use &lt;a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/200510/what-is.pdf"&gt;late-20th century algorithms&lt;/a&gt; to figure out what numbers you can plug into the board that satisfy all the rules and all the clues. These algorithms are based on describing the structure of the special ring – called &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ideal-mathematics"&gt;an ideal&lt;/a&gt; – these game board clues make within the larger ring. The algorithms will tell you if there’s no solution to the puzzle. If there are multiple solutions, the algorithms will find them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a small example where setting up the algebra is harder than just doing the puzzle. But the techniques generalize widely. You can use algebra to tackle &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2301.13105"&gt;problems in artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, robotics, cryptography, quantum computing and so much more – all with the same bag of tricks you’d use to solve the Sudoku puzzle or Rubik’s cube.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers found that women with inattentive ADHD symptoms reported lower orgasmic consistency than those without ADHD symptoms or with other subtypes. These findings provide new insight into the challenges women with ADHD may face in their sexual experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects about 2–6% of adults. It is typically characterized by patterns of inattention, impulsivity, and/or hyperactivity. While ADHD has traditionally been studied more in men, there is growing recognition that women often experience different symptoms. Women are more likely to show signs of inattention, which are internal and less disruptive than hyperactivity, making them more prone to being overlooked or misdiagnosed. This difference in presentation can have far-reaching consequences, including in areas not often discussed—such as sexual functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past research has consistently shown that women experience lower rates of orgasm during partnered sex than men, a phenomenon often referred to as the “orgasm gap.” Although orgasm is not required for sexual satisfaction, persistent difficulty achieving orgasm—sometimes called anorgasmia—can lead to emotional distress and reduced relationship satisfaction. Some studies have linked problems with orgasm to cognitive distraction, such as intrusive thoughts or difficulty focusing during sex. Since inattention is a hallmark of one form of ADHD, the researchers wanted to know whether this might explain why some women experience less consistent orgasms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe that furthering research and education on women’s sexual health and well-being is essential in the pursuit of equality and to support their overall health,” explained study author Tina Jensen-Fogt of Kwantlen Polytechnic University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Discovering that the research on sexual pleasure for women with ADHD is very limited, we were inspired to expand on this topic to better understand how ADHD symptoms may affect women’s sexual experiences during partnered sex. Our primary goals were to explore how orgasmic consistency rates vary across the three subtypes of ADHD symptomatology, and to confirm whether women with inattentive ADHD subtype symptoms reported the lowest rate of orgasmic consistency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this question, researchers conducted a large online survey involving 815 cisgender women who were sexually active with at least one partner in the past six months. The participants ranged in age from 18 to 84 and represented a wide range of backgrounds. They were recruited through social media, online forums, and a university research platform. Importantly, participants did not need a formal ADHD diagnosis to be included in the study. Instead, they completed a widely used ADHD self-report scale that allowed the researchers to categorize them based on their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants also completed validated questionnaires that measured their orgasmic consistency during partnered sex, their level of sexual assertiveness, and their overall attitudes toward sex. This allowed the researchers to account for variables that are known to influence sexual experiences, such as the ability to communicate sexual needs or personal comfort with sexual activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that ADHD symptomatology in general was associated with slightly lower orgasmic consistency. However, this effect was small on its own. When researchers examined the data by ADHD subtype, the picture became clearer. Women with predominantly inattentive symptoms—those who reported frequent difficulty sustaining attention or being easily distracted—had the lowest rates of orgasmic consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Women who experience predominantly inattentive symptoms of ADHD experienced lower rates of orgasmic consistency compared to controls and women who experienced predominantly hyperactive-impulsive or combined subtype symptoms,” Jensen-Fogt told PsyPost. “This puts women with inattentive ADHD at greater risk for the negative outcomes associated with difficulties in achieving orgasm, such as reduced sexual satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, and self-esteem, as well as to increased rates of emotional distress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, women with predominantly hyperactive-impulsive symptoms actually reported higher orgasmic consistency compared to both women with predominantly inattentive symptoms and those without ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One somewhat surprising finding was that participants who met the study’s criteria for the hyperactive-impulsive subtype of ADHD had greater orgasmic consistency rates than those in the control group, who did not meet the criteria for ADHD,” Jensen-Fogt said. “This suggests that the hyperactive-impulsive features of ADHD may provide some benefit to achieving orgasm, though additional research is necessary to confirm this finding and explore why this might be the case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at how medication use influenced orgasmic consistency. Interestingly, women who did not currently meet the threshold for ADHD symptoms—but who reported taking medication typically prescribed for ADHD—had higher orgasm consistency than non-medicated women without ADHD symptoms. This suggests that medication may help manage symptoms that interfere with sexual functioning, although more research is needed to understand the role of specific medications and doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another factor the researchers explored was sexual orientation. Among women without ADHD symptoms, those who identified as sexual minorities—such as lesbian, bisexual, or pansexual—reported higher orgasmic consistency than heterosexual women. However, this difference was not found among women with ADHD symptoms. This raises interesting questions about how sexual behavior, partner dynamics, and neurodiversity intersect to shape sexual experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has several strengths, including a large and diverse sample, with participants from a range of ethnic backgrounds, education levels, and sexual orientations. The study was also pre-registered, meaning the researchers made their analysis plan public before collecting data. This improves the credibility of the findings by reducing the risk of biased or post-hoc interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as with all research, there are limitations. ADHD was identified through self-reported symptoms, not clinical diagnoses, and medication details were not collected. The study focused only on partnered sex involving clitoral stimulation, excluding solo sexual activity. Importantly, the findings are correlational, meaning they show associations but cannot establish cause-and-effect relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our finding of increased orgasmic functioning among women who report using medication for ADHD symptom management need to be interpreted cautiously,” Jensen-Fogt said. “The types of medications participants used were not recorded; so while there may be some indication that medication for ADHD symptom management potentially ameliorates orgasmic difficulties, much further research is needed to examine the effects of specific types of medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The long-term goals for this research include informing educational interventions for women with ADHD and for those struggling with anorgasmia. Further, we hope to engage in further research examining potential differences across other sexual functioning domains based on ADHD subtype. Our hope is to better understand what sexual difficulties are more commonly experienced by women with ADHD so that we may better support them in living sexually healthy and fulfilling lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2025.2489771" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Exploring Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Symptomatology in Relation to Women’s Orgasmic Consistency&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Tina Jensen-Fogt and &lt;a href="https://www.orgasmresearchlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cory L.

Even people who had not suffered a stroke but had plaque were living with 16 times more plastic in their arteries, &lt;a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/health/study-finds-50-times-higher-levels-of-micro-and-nanoplastics-in-stroke-patients-arteries" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to Down to Earth;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to Down to Earth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Clark's findings suggest that microplastics and smaller nanoplastics can find their way into our bloodstreams and plaque blockages. Since the carotid artery supplies blood to the brain, anything that gets in the way can have life-changing and potentially fatal health impacts, such as strokes and heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The full findings were presented at the American Heart Association's Vascular Discovery 2025 Scientific Sessions in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is plastic in our bodies important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The presence of microscopic bits of plastic flowing through our veins is alarming, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Karen L.

"But we did not know that micronanoparticles of plastic might be associated with atheromas [plaques]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Beyond the normal dangers of plaque buildups, Clark and his team suspect the plastic particles may mess with the immune responses of certain anti-inflammatory genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The findings also showcase the extent of the world's plastic problem, which wreaks havoc on all kinds of ecosystems.

Like, maybe you tell yourself you can only eat brown rice and can never make exceptions for white rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It winds up becoming less about healthy eating, which is usually what it starts out as, and more about an unhealthy obsession with food purity or ‘clean eating,’ or ‘proper eating,’” Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It messes with your social life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it crosses the line is when it starts to interfere with your activities of daily living,” Auguste said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your stress about food interferes with your social engagements, like you turn down plans because you aren’t sure of the food situation, it could be cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it impacts your ability to live socially in the world, comfortably, then it’s a problem that you should address,” Auguste added.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It winds up being less about the average person concerned about healthy food, and more just really obsessing about it where it’s almost your personality,” Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: skynesher via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;skynesher via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Orthorexia, or a preoccupation with healthy eating, is becoming more common in society.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You spend lots of time analyzing ingredient lists.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s normal to check the ingredient lists and nutrition labels on food from time to time, especially if you have an allergy or a specific nutrition goal you’re trying to hit. But, for someone with orthorexia, they may find that they’re “compulsively, all the time, analyzing all the ingredients,” Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may turn into hours and hours spent meal planning or researching the nutrition of every ingredient that’s going into your food, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you break your food rules, you feel anxious or guilty.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the line comes when you start to feel like you’re thinking about [healthy eating] all the time,” Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you feel like you &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/anxiety" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="have anxiety" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68220270e4b01f1185018854" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/life/topic/anxiety" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;have anxiety&lt;/a&gt; ... you’re nervous about eating something ... and you feel like that more often than not, then that could be a sign that maybe you’re thinking about it too much,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for if you feel guilty after breaking any of your food rules, Heise added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auguste added that if your thoughts about food are disrupting your mental health at all, you should consider talking to someone. Auguste also said if it interferes with your physical health, it’s absolutely a red flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what to do if this sounds like you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With support from either a dietitian or mental health professional, you can determine whether your healthy eating is simply that — or something more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really important to talk to somebody like a dietitian who specializes in disordered eating, a therapist who specializes in it, who can help you figure out [if this is a problem for you],” Auguste said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietitians generally take insurance, noted Auguste, and they can help you make sure you’re on the right track with your eating, whether or not you have specific concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can definitely recover from orthorexia if you have the right support,” said Heise, “so, as soon as you feel those feelings, address it as early as possible so that it doesn’t turn into something that rules your life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthy eating is a lifelong process and isn’t meant to be perfect.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to what you eat, your nutrition needs likely differ from your partner’s, your neighbor’s and your favorite social media influencer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, don’t put too much stock in social media nutrition trends or what diet a friend is raving about, Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of obsessing over the latest food trend, focus on realistic goals — “so, not focusing on whether or not a food is clean, but focusing on whether or not you have variety in your meals,” Heise said. “Are you getting a variety of different foods? Are you getting a variety of different nutrients? Because that’s where true nutrition comes in.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auguste said it’s important to let go of all-or-nothing thinking when it comes to eating, which includes rules around following one specific diet or a rigid plan to lose weight. “I have so many patients that do that, and then it’s not sustainable to be 100% all of the time,” Auguste added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, when they fall off of the diet, they feel like a failure and give up, she noted. “I feel like that is a downside for somebody with orthorexia, is that you are afraid of letting go of the 100%, and you’re afraid that if you let go, that you fall back into that nothing,” Auguste said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to find the middle ground and remind yourself that you don’t have to be perfect, added Auguste. “You can say to yourself, ‘I usually eat healthy.’ You don’t have to say, ‘I always eat healthy,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you use “always” language, you “introduce that concept of failure and judging yourself,” Auguste noted. And it’s perfectly OK, and not a failure, to have that salty snack or sweet treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more practice you can get of letting yourself find the middle, where you’re not ‘always,’ you’re just ‘usually’ doing something, I think the better,” Auguste said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you work on all of this, have compassion for yourself.

This from a person who always has clean laundry and can’t sleep unless there are chia seeds soaking in the fridge for breakfast. His assessment of depression was meaningless to me.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m “built different.” But I do love easy, acquisition-based routes to self-improvement, so I did what any slightly crunchy-granola zillennial with a skin-care routine and four-plus hours of daily screen time might and Googled “depression supplements.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon19ih000n3b77rcqpqdy2@published" data-word-count="186"&gt;I was aware of the available pharmaceutical treatments, but I was wary, nearly phobic, of psychiatric drugs. Everyone in my immediate family has been highly medicated on a cocktail of ADHD, depression, and anxiety medication for as long as I can remember. I’ve watched the agonizing process of my parents switching medication enough times to see that managing them can be as much of a job as being not depressed. For a while, my dad was on an Elvis-like cocktail of Ritalin for focus and clonazepam to take the edge off. Over the years, as his dosage of one crept up, the other rose to meet it. At their peak, my father, usually a quick-talking latter-day Groucho Marx, started speaking slowly, losing his train of thought. When he decided to taper off his behemoth dose of benzos, it took almost a year of agonizing weaning, exiled from the artificial benzo bliss and sent into an anxious state far worse than whatever the drugs were meant to mask. There’s a reason when you Google “benzo withdrawal” the first result is a large banner for the suicide-prevention hotline.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon19jz000o3b77vxsp7lkb@published" data-word-count="104"&gt;To be clear, I do believe in &lt;em&gt;mental health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;When I started looking for “depression supplements,” I had been in psychoanalytic therapy for about two years. She was the Platonic ideal of a therapist: an older Jewish woman who wore big wooden beads and worked from an office in the West Village. She pushed me to, as she said, “detangle a web of contradicting and harmful associations I’d made to cope with being a living person.” Also, she worked on a sliding scale and was covered by insurance. She never suggested I go on medication for depression. Actually, she didn’t think I was depressed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon19ls000p3b77bkn0mcim@published" data-word-count="107"&gt;Still, I figured the supplements could only help&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; And if they did nothing, then I’d at least enjoy the positive placebo effect of participating in &lt;em&gt;self-care&lt;/em&gt;. Like all the times I’d taken zinc to stop a cold, ingested probiotics for my “biome,” or any other tiny sugar pills found in the homeopathic aisle — I figured losing 20-ish dollars was the worst thing that might happen.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;I consulted websites of varying levels of credibility, including Healthline, Goop, and the blog of RFK Jr.’s consigliere, Dr. Mark Hyman, who seems to believe that frequent trips to the sauna and a diet of nuts and berries makes you age backward.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon19n7000q3b770skdmv5j@published" data-word-count="88"&gt;Some sites suggested classic supplements like vitamin D and fish oil. Others hawked more New Wave “adaptogens” like ashwagandha and “Reishi mushrooms,” powdered panaceas I’d seen for sale at Los Angeles crystal-and-smoothie emporiums like Moon Juice and Erewhon. My favorite skin-care–slash–woo-woo store, CAP Beauty, recommended a $2,000 “BioMat” that “uses a combination of heat and amethyst to drive far infrared rays and negative ions deep into our cells and tissues.” But man cannot persist on vibrations alone, and I was looking for something cheap and expressly &lt;em&gt;mood boosting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon19ol000r3b77mukudxsz@published" data-word-count="109"&gt;All of the sites mentioned St. John’s wort, which was apparently amazing for “a positive mood.” None said it would cure colds, banish brain fog, or make my joints feel better. I liked that it was specifically&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a supplement helpful for aiding in the treatment of &lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/st-johns-wort#:~:text=What%20Have%20We%20Learned?,ADHD%2C%20and%20seasonal%20affective%20disorder"&gt;mild&lt;/a&gt; to moderate depression. My depression, if anything, was mild to moderate. I just wanted to be in a positive mood all the time. Plus I’d once taken a bath using Susanne Kaufmann’s $65 St. John’s wort bath powder and it made my skin feel slippery-smooth. So I went to Duane Reade and bought a bottle of Nature’s Way St. John’s wort supplements.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon19ru000s3b77mqdjckl1@published" data-word-count="155"&gt;All recommendations for supplements, including classics like vitamin C, include a disclaimer: Speak to your doctor if you’re taking other medication. Well, I wasn’t. A website I consulted said St. John’s wort could make hormonal birth control less effective, but I had a copper IUD. Also I’d never even heard of anyone getting sick from vitamins. So I started taking the dose the bottle suggested. Three caplets, twice a day. I took those dark green pills for five months. Was I in a better mood than usual? I don’t know. Honestly, I tend to have a pretty cheery disposition except for when I have to do things that are irritating, like commuting two hours in the dark. But those five months were spread across the summer, meaning I had access to the healing powers of the sun and the Atlantic Ocean. So when my fourth bottle ran out in early November, I didn’t buy any more.&lt;/p&gt;

I got home around 4 a.m., feeling full of energy. The next morning, I woke up early and cleaned my room while listening to Ethel Merman and Barbra Streisand, singing along to “There’s No Business Like Show Business.” After, I met on Zoom with my psychoanalyst, who was spending extra time upstate for the holiday. We talked about how amazing I felt; our sessions, I said, were definitely working. Then I went down to the small grocery store on my corner to get some lunch. It was lightly snowing, and I felt buoyant in my large goose-down parka. I picked up some chicken noodle soup and a box of chocolate-covered biscuits named after a German philosopher who believed we live in the best of all possible worlds. In the checkout line, I felt a stabbing pain in my lower right abdomen, a sort of one-second period cramp. The woman at the checkout beckoned me over, and I put the soup on the counter. My vision blurred. I felt as if I were in a scene in a war movie when the sound gets cut in the middle of a battle to convey that the soldiers are overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1a3g000v3b7725cluz3j@published" data-word-count="143"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aha!&lt;/em&gt; I thought, still feeling in control of everything.&lt;em&gt; I know this feeling.&lt;/em&gt; I’d fainted before, once from dehydration and basically every time I’ve smoked pot. With my vision going, I crouched down into a ball to lessen the impact to my head from the impending fall, then toppled over. A few seconds later, I woke up with five people crowded over me. I live on the Upper West Side, so there were multiple elderly women offering to call me an ambulance. I was fine, I told them, I’d only fainted. The store manager brought me a bottle of water and a small bar of some of the very bad Turkish chocolate I’d always wondered if anyone actually bought on purpose. I sat on a stool, eating the waxy chocolate, feeling better by the second as the blood came back to my head.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1a4v000w3b77f3wh45zo@published" data-word-count="137"&gt;But at home, eating my soup, the pain in my lower abdomen started worrying me. Its sharpness earlier was strange, and the fact that it was now totally gone was equally unsettling. I called my doctor’s office, a large practice in Midtown East that typically schedules appointments six months in advance. They said they could fit me in the next day if it was urgent, so I decided to try to relax until then. Except instead I had a full-blown panic attack. My friend who lives nearby came over and decided the best thing to do was have me do some kind of physical exercise so I could “be more in my body.” We put on the Tracy Anderson arm-exercise video and flapped our arms like inelegant birds, a move credited with sculpting the arms of Gwyneth.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1a6e000x3b77jrtvra9i@published" data-word-count="184"&gt;The next day, now afraid of leaving the house by myself lest I faint again, I asked my dad to accompany me to my appointment in the Midtown East hospital district. At the doctor’s office, they said my appointment was actually one month from now. That was impossible, but they refused to believe me or let me see anybody. So my dad called his &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; cardiologist, whose office happened to be upstairs, and, through the same charm, winning personality, and ability to &lt;em&gt;work the system&lt;/em&gt; that has always made him a favorite with strangers, the cardiologist eventually met us outside on the sidewalk, where he gave me an evaluation. He said that I should have gone to the emergency room after I’d fainted, but that now, since I no longer had the abdominal symptoms, there was nothing really to test. He bet it was an “ovarian torsion,” in which my ovaries twisted around each other and then quickly righted themselves, which was extremely serious, and that if it were to happen again, which he &lt;em&gt;bet it would, &lt;/em&gt;I should go straight to the ER.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1a7n000y3b77c1y2x4vj@published" data-word-count="88"&gt;Of course, that wasn’t the most calming thing to hear, but I white-knuckled myself into submission that evening by listening to a calming podcast by Tara Brach, the Buddhist meditation coach who said my anxious thoughts should be but waves on the ocean. “By not resisting, by letting the waves wash through us, we began to relax,” she said. The thoughts &lt;em&gt;Am I dizzy? Am I about to faint?&lt;/em&gt; flooded in nonetheless, leaving me frantic as I attempted to grade 27 undergraduate papers about what makes comedy funny.&lt;/p&gt;

But with the cardiologist’s &lt;em&gt;gentle words &lt;/em&gt;ringing in my ears, I decided to visit the CityMD on my block. The doctor there informed me that I needed to go to the hospital immediately. He said that fainting when accompanied by pain is often a “limb-threatening” illness and that I absolutely needed to be checked by an MRI machine ASAP. Somehow this information put me in a better mood than a medical emergency should have. That there might be a real medical reason for my fainting meant that it could soon come to an end. By the time I got to Mount Sinai, I felt amazing. If I fainted here, I thought cheerfully, they could probe my insides and get down to the bottom of what was going on. But after they ran myriad tests, they told me that the CityMD doctor had no idea what he was talking about. From their tone, I could tell they thought &lt;em&gt;And that’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;why he’s stuck working at CityMD&lt;/em&gt;. The doctor said the only possible emergency she’d have imagined was the small chance I had a life-threatening blood clot in my stomach. I’d have to wait four hours to get scanned. I would be kind of crazy to wait for that, the doctor told me, and if it were her, she’d go home. I felt a bit like Tony Soprano when he screams at the doctors for telling him there’s nothing medically wrong with him. But I had plans in two hours to see my friend Caroline’s concert at Terminal 5, and I was relieved to be able to leave the emergency room, where I saw a lot of people way more fucked up than I was.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1afn00113b77jkxiu6oe@published" data-word-count="190"&gt;At Terminal 5, I was in the VIP section, right next to the speakers. My best friend, who had no idea what was happening to me, bought me a $27 tequila-soda. Everything was right as rain. At the after-party, I celebrated my internal secret victory with a few more drinks. I was outside and normal. Except the next morning, a growing sense of unease crept back in, accompanied by a brand-new ringing in my ears courtesy of the speakers, and a fear that I did, in fact, have the blood clot the doctor at the hospital had warned me about. The fear of fainting had morphed: Suddenly, I had no idea where I was. Actually, I had no idea &lt;em&gt;who &lt;/em&gt;I was. I felt certain I had to escape the room, the apartment, and my body. Whipped into a frenzy, I FaceTimed my boyfriend, who was Britishly on “holiday” in “Wales” with his “school friends.” Seeing his face somehow reinforced my dissociation. He looked like a stranger, an impostor. I felt locked behind my own face, which I could see in the phone reflection was contorted into a rictus of a smile.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1amm00123b77by1romd7@published" data-word-count="110"&gt;He could sense that something was amiss, and when he asked what was wrong, my response was a terrifying cackle. “What’s &lt;em&gt;wrong? &lt;/em&gt;How can you even ask that?” He gently recommended I go see my parents who lived only a mile away. It was getting dark outside, and various inanimate objects in the sublet apartment had started to appear menacing: the beaded curtain that blocked off the kitchen, the Calder-inspired mobile, the wall clock covered in rainbow plastic spikes. The psychiatrist I would eventually meet with, a panic specialist, explained I had been experiencing the “three D’s of panic disorder,” dissociation, depersonalization, and derealization, and for an unusually long duration.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1aor00133b77zr3l3lwo@published" data-word-count="191"&gt;After I had been on the “three D’s” for five hours, crying and screaming, I took my boyfriend’s suggestion and called my parents. My mom was visiting her brother in Pennsylvania, and my dad was at dinner in midtown with his childhood friend, but he left when he heard the urgency in my voice. I lived then on the tenth floor of a prewar building with an elevator that broke at least twice a month, so my dad got stuck inside the elevator for a half-hour on the second floor. Of course, an elevator is a Faraday cage, so I experienced those 30 minutes as the complete disappearance of my dad from the Earth. When he eventually got out, he climbed eight flights of stairs with his wooden walking stick. He found me shivering and crying and was calm. Having a family history of anxiety and depression, I suppose, means that the family comes equipped with skills to manage anxiety and depression. He sat next to the bed, his thick, knobbled wooden walking stick leaving the soothing impression that he was a Gandalf-like protector. Then he gave me my first-ever Valium.&lt;/p&gt;

No, better. It’s like clean socks and a hot bowl of chili by the campfire after a long day backpacking through mud. It’s like your grandmother brushing your hair after a hot bath. I probably don’t have to explain this particular feeling of well-being, as tens of millions of Americans are legally prescribed benzos every year. Xanax cozy is our hygge&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;an American gemütlichkeit&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt; In the words of Future, I was “welcome[d] to the Xanny family.”&lt;/p&gt;

This seemed to be the right kind of exception. “Hi, I’m sorry to bother you,” I wrote her, “but wanted to tell you I fainted right after our last meeting. Have been in sort of a state of nervousness and occasional panic / crying / freak out since. Went to the doctor who said nothing was wrong with me. But still feel very anxious and tired and freaked out.” We met on Zoom, where my therapist informed me she thought that through our sessions I had dissolved so many of my frameworks and coping mechanisms I’d been left destabilized and was in the process of rebuilding on steadier footing. Though I believe in Dr. Freud and his theories, I was not convinced.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1ay700173b774qe1yx7i@published" data-word-count="136"&gt;In any case, I told her, I had to return to teaching the following week and was sure that, in this state, I couldn’t make it to Newark via train. The under-construction Penn Station had become a homeless shelter guarded by military police with AK-47s, in which I was often tapped on the shoulder by some very severely mentally ill people. If I fainted there, what would happen? What if I started hysterically crying in front of my students? So my psychoanalyst referred me to a psychiatrist and said she’d have her call me that day. This psychiatrist was no Dr. Pill-pusher. Instead, she was a gentle Swedish American woman, also a boomer, with long white braids and reading glasses that hung from beaded Croakies. The Western Massachusetts–ness of her array put me immediately at ease.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1azm00183b77cugx04z1@published" data-word-count="95"&gt;She was also an expert in panic disorders and said I looked like I was in severe physical pain. She asked me about anything that could have triggered the panic attacks. Any major life changes? No. Any medical issues? No, aside from the new, imaginary ones. Any changes in medication? This wasn’t adding up for her, she said. She asked me to seriously think about if anything traumatic or different had happened to me. Just as we were giving up, she asked if I’d been taking any vitamins. “Oh, yes,” I said, “St. John’s wort.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1b0p00193b7734z5unyo@published" data-word-count="288"&gt;She sported a grave face. “Well, there’s your problem,” she said&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Apparently, St. John’s wort is metabolized similarly to an SSRI like Zoloft or Lexapro. When I’d gone off of it abruptly, it was as if I’d quit a high dose of an SSRIs cold turkey. The mystery had been solved, but the misery was nowhere near over. She said that because I was taking an unregulated substance without proper studies or trials regarding cessation, it was impossible to know how long it would take to get back to normal. To feel better, she said, I would absolutely need to take a psychiatric drug. After I refused Zoloft, she decided on a course of Xanax to be taken every four hours to “hold me”; after three months, I’d wean off. One of the things I remember about those first few days, when the worst of the panic attacks had been shut down by the Xanax, but when all I could do was stare blankly at &lt;em&gt;30 Rock&lt;/em&gt;, was my deification of Dr. Leo Sternbach, the Polish scientist who had discovered benzodiazepine in a Roche lab in New Jersey in 1956. &lt;em&gt;Thank you, Dr. Sternbach, &lt;/em&gt;I thought as I read his Wikipedia page in the dark. &lt;em&gt;What a miracle you escaped the Nazis in 1941, what a clever doctor you were to accept a fellowship in Zurich so that you were saved and could invent medicine to save me. &lt;/em&gt;I couldn’t stop imagining what it would have been like if I’d had this psychotic break in, say, ancient Greece. Would I have been stuck like this forever? Would everyone have thought I was a seer in contact with Athena or something while really I was having a mental breakdown?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1b1y001a3b77q7pz5qyn@published" data-word-count="146"&gt;Even while on the Xanax, during those first few months I had a small panic attack at least once a week, which felt like charging rivers forcing their way over the dam of the drugs. The triggers were always different. A single bite of chicken once sent currents of panic to my brain at a birthday dinner, leading me to hide in the bathroom of a restaurant. At a crowded weekend matinee of a Norwegian indie film, realizing it might be difficult to leave my central seat to get to the bathroom in case I had a panic attack, I ended up having a panic attack. In these cases, I would then take &lt;em&gt;still more&lt;/em&gt; Xanax, which would take about half an hour to kick in, time I usually spent in some bathroom stall sweating through my shirt like a loser kid in a teen movie.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1b36001b3b77kgsdlwu7@published" data-word-count="116"&gt;Eventually, I figured out that if I just simply held the bottle of Xanax — if I just touched the bottle and felt it in my hands — I would remember that I could cancel out any panic attack that was coming. The pill bottle became talismanic, and its contents were crumbled and powdery from being shaken around like a magical maraca. After three months, under the psychiatrist’s supervision, I began to taper down my dosage by a quarter milligram every two weeks. I started the Xanax regimen in late November. Nine months later, in August, I was finally off the daily dosage, and only taking the pills “As Needed,” as it read on the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

RFK Jr. and his MAHA friends peddle “Peptides” and intermittent fasting”; Trump’s nominee for surgeon general wrote a book with a chapter called “Trust Yourself, Not Your Doctor.” Still, recently, I was served some ads by a mommy-earthy fashion designer for a mushroom-adaptogen coffee. Drinking this would supposedly give me more energy and tackle “brain fog,” that eternal bogeyman. And I really considered buying some. Her life looked amazing. I told my therapist about it. She forbade me in the clearest terms from messing around with supplements and seemed genuinely bewildered by my desire to experiment further after what had happened the last time. “Don’t you already feel good?”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;she asked. “And if you don’t, why don’t you want something that’ll actually work?”&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Rage, fatigue, mood swings, memory loss, hot flashes, itchy ears, inability to sleep, loss of libido, hair thinning, depression, weight gain, sore knees, night sweats, incontinence.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These are all symptoms of perimenopause — or possibly just occupational hazards of midlife.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As Generation X and millennials ease into their 40s and 50s, they are ready to shake off the stigma around menopause and the time leading up to it — called perimenopause — in favor of embracing treatment. An army of &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/menopause-tiktok-1.6861886" target="_blank"&gt;influencers&lt;/a&gt; are pushing diet supplements and &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/11/21/2985347/0/en/Menopause-Market-Size-to-Hit-USD-27-63-Billion-by-2033-Straits-Research.html" target="_blank"&gt;other products&lt;/a&gt; promising to help women through this phase.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But how do you know if you are even in perimenopause?&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Unlike menopause — defined by the cessation of menstruation — perimenopause can be sneaky and hard to pinpoint. There's no one definitive test for it, and disentangling the symptoms from other factors can make it hard to treat. Here's how to sort out your symptoms and consider your treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Be persistent in seeking care, and consider a specialist &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When Michelle Rockwell started struggling with sleep, perimenopause was not the first thing her primary care doctor suspected. " They said, 'You're too young," says Rockwell, who is now 40, and started seeking medical care a year ago. "It's easy to discount the symptoms. Doctors will say 'It's just stress or whatever,'" she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rockwell did not dispute that her life was stressful — she was working full time as a forensic scientist, raising a daughter, and competed in powerlifting. But she says something felt drastically wrong.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I literally had this feeling of like, I don't know who I am anymore," she says. "I was like, I don't recognize myself. I've since come to figure out that we have these levels of hormones and they affect your brain."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rockwell saw two different providers — a primary care doctor and a holistic practitioner — before she found a doctor online who specializes in menopause care. The Menopause Society provides &lt;a href="https://portal.menopause.org/NAMS/NAMS/Directory/Menopause-Practitioner.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;this online database&lt;/a&gt; of doctors who are trained and certified in treating menopause and perimenopause.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;After much course correction and fine tuning with a specialist, Rockwell is now using hormone therapy, which she says has helped significantly. " I feel better now than in a long time," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;General practitioners often aren't afforded the time to thoroughly evaluate their patients for perimenopause, says Dr. Monica Christmas, associate medical director of &lt;a href="https://menopause.org/" target="_blank"&gt;the Menopause Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Specialists, she says, not only have more knowledge about this condition but are also not subject to the same time constraints.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Accept the uncertainty of it all &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Perimenopause is often thought to be a problem of a deficit of estrogen, but that is not necessarily the case, says Christmas. The transition into menopause, she explains, is characterized by fluctuations in hormones, which is why many people's experiences can be inconsistent and rocky.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;" Perimenopause is the most tumultuous time for many people," says Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Once people get through this phase and into menopause, when their ovaries aren't making any estrogen anymore, says Christmas, "many actually feel better."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Moreover, she points out, it's impossible to disentangle perimenopause from the overall process of aging, which can be a time of significant physiological change. Add to that the pressures of career, family, caretaking responsibilities, financial stress — and midlife can be a roller coaster of uncertainty and stress.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Christmas cautions that a certain amount of acceptance of this chaos is necessary for getting through it. She says some of her patients tell her: "The fact that you told me that these mood swings and this brain fog is real, that I'm not imagining it, that's actually enough for me.'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Others will go on to pursue treatment options. "Some people have very few symptoms, if any at all," says Christmas, while others "might have every possible symptom that you could think of. Most of us are somewhere in between."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Get tested for other conditions &lt;/h3&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Some clinicians suggest a strategy of first testing for a range of other conditions before considering whether perimenopause is the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The 40s are a time in life when a lot of different autoimmune diseases can begin to show up," says Nanette Santoro, a gynecologist in Colorado who treats menopause. Often, she says, other conditions can have similar symptoms to perimenopause — many of them easier to diagnose.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Quite often I'll do a miniature workup to make sure there's no signs of early diabetes, which happens in this age group," says Santoro. Thyroid problems, she says, can also make an appearance during this time, as can rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, hypertension and fibromyalgia. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/01/16/796682276/for-some-women-nearing-menopause-depression-and-anxiety-can-spike" target="_blank"&gt;Mental health concerns&lt;/a&gt; like anxiety and depression are also worth considering as well.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Santoro says she's often more inclined to test for and treat these conditions than she is to measure hormone levels, which isn't necessarily that helpful. " If it's not well timed to the menstrual cycle, you may get misleading tests," she says, "and even then, you still may get misleading tests because they vary from month to month."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Understand treatment options &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hormone therapy to treat especially troubling symptoms like severe hot flashes and crippling mood swings has been a subject of &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061559" target="_blank"&gt;much debate&lt;/a&gt; in recent decades. While many providers who treat menopause say it can be helpful or even &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/05/01/1248525256/hormones-menopause-hormone-therapy-hot-flashes" target="_blank"&gt;life changing&lt;/a&gt; for some patients, many stress that more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;" I would love to be able to say that hormone therapy reduces cardiovascular risk or cognitive decline later on in life," says the Menopause Society's Christmas, "or all the miraculous anti-aging properties that people are claiming."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some evidence suggests hormone therapy could have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25754617/" target="_blank"&gt;long-term benefits&lt;/a&gt;, she says, but research is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38484309/" target="_blank"&gt;not definitive&lt;/a&gt; enough to recommend it for all women in perimenopause.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In 2002, the &lt;a href="https://www.whi.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Women's Health Initiative&lt;/a&gt; study halted hormone therapy among its participants due to concerns about increased cancer risk and stroke. But since then, scientists have reassessed the data and new types of hormone therapy have become available.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As a result, many experts now say past concerns about these elevated risks &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/05/01/1248525256/hormones-menopause-hormone-therapy-hot-flashes" target="_blank"&gt;were overblown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, says Christmas " it's a low risk, but it's not zero." Clinicians warn that people need to take into account things like family history and other factors for cancer when considering hormone therapy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hormone therapy also does not work for everyone.  "I have patients who try hormones for a couple of months and come back and say — we're doing something else," says gynecologist Santoro. Some patients, she says, complain of weight gain, breast tenderness or "all kinds of annoying PMS symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hormone therapy may be especially beneficial for those who reach perimenopause earlier in life. "It has been helping tremendously," said Krista Russell-Adams, who hit perimenopause at the age of 37 and experienced anxiety, brain fog, persistently itchy ears and darkening of skin, called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10092853/" target="_blank"&gt;melasma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Christmas says there are other pharmaceutical options that she prescribes patients to address specific symptoms. Frequent, heavy bleeding during periods for example — which can &lt;a href="https://menopause.org/press-releases/are-you-just-tired-or-are-you-menopause-tired" target="_blank"&gt;lead to anemia and fatigue&lt;/a&gt; — can be addressed with birth control or an IUD, which may even stop their periods.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think of it as a really nice way of cheating the menopause transition," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Embrace healthy aging habits&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some symptoms associated with perimenopause may have more to do with the aging process.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00692-2" target="_blank"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that in both men and women, there are jumps in aging that happen around the ages of 45 and 60. "A lot of women will notice a change in metabolism," says Santoro. "It's not all menopause."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Because of these changes, says Santoro, it's especially important to double down on healthy habits including diet, exercise — especially resistance training, for &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/02/18/1231552773/protein-diet-muscle-strength-training-muscle-loss-women" target="_blank"&gt;maintaining muscle&lt;/a&gt; — and healthy sleep. " Pretty much what your mother told you — just do more of it," says Santoro.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Christmas advises her patients to "be very meticulous about what we're fueling our bodies with. As we age, we're not getting another one."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People who may have been able to "get away with not exercising as much or eating whatever we wanted in our younger years" may have to make some significant changes to maintain health, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Those kinds of behavioral adjustments, she says, can have profound impacts "that just giving somebody a pill" can't match.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

What about faster or longer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/cardiologist-heart-healthy-habits-rcna138372" target="_blank"&gt;TODAY.com previously spoke with cardiologists&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Marc Eisenberg, associate professor of medicine at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York, and Dr. Nieca Goldberg, clinical associate professor at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, about their go-to habits to maintain their heart health, and they shared that walking is an important part of their routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Cardiologist tip of the day: Walk at least 5 days a week&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cardio exercises tend to have the most benefits for heart health, so your goal on your walks should be to move quickly, according to the cardiologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I get my heart rate up when I walk because I walk pretty fast,” Goldberg says. “It’s important for people to do exercises that are natural to them and easy for them to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Eisenberg advises walking fast 40-50 minutes a day for at least five days a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Heart disease can creep up on you.
