But the cures often come with severe effects on quality of life. That can include removal of the stomach or bladder, a permanent colostomy bag, radiation that makes patients infertile and lasting damage from chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So a research group at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, using a drug from the pharmaceutical company GSK, tried something different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The researchers started with a group of 103 people. The trial participants were among the 2 to 3 percent of cancer patients with tumors that should respond to immunotherapy, a drug that overcomes barriers that prevent the immune system from attacking cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But in clinical trials, immunotherapy is not supposed to replace the standard treatments. The researchers, led by Dr. Luis A. Diaz Jr. and Dr. Andrea Cercek, decided to give &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.jemperlihcp.com/?cc=ps_URB1EFKZME2461058&amp;amp;mtrc=240012&amp;amp;mcm=240012&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=21607606479&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAACUY6raNQGmtKNPqxUXD9_68gN_zt&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw5azABhD1ARIsAA0WFUEsfdtoNrkFWkDRZPh_q43pIIPf3LuDXkN3l44zhqM1ZzZSazPpEOcaAgF9EALw_wcB&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;dostarlimab&lt;/a&gt;, an immunotherapy drug, on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The result was stunning, and could bring hope to the limited cohort of patients contending with these cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In 49 of the patients, who had rectal cancer, the tumors disappeared and, after five years, have not recurred.

It was August 2022. The tumor, she said, blocked off a portion of her esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach, making it difficult to swallow food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The standard treatment approach for &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-patients-often-better-less-intensive-treatment-study-shows-rcna155158" target="_blank"&gt;esophageal cancer&lt;/a&gt; — chemotherapy and radiation, followed by surgery to remove part of the esophagus and stomach  — “is quite devastating,” said Dr. Luis Diaz, the head of solid tumor oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. “One can overcome that, and there’s a new normal after that, but it’s not like what it was before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Going through all of those treatments, Sideris said, “would have been horrendous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Instead, she received just one treatment — &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/jimmy-carter-drug-immunotherapy-melanoma-rcna153166" target="_blank"&gt;immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt; — as part of a clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering. It’s been two years since she completed her treatment and she’s in remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/250425-Maureen-Sideris-se-116p-0d7813.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250425-Maureen-Sideris-se-116p-0d7813.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/250425-Maureen-Sideris-se-116p-0d7813.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250425-Maureen-Sideris-se-116p-0d7813.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250425-Maureen-Sideris-se-116p-0d7813.jpg" alt="Maureen Sideris"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Maureen Sideris, of Duchess County, New York, has been in remission for two years.

You don’t need chemotherapy, radiation or surgery,’” Diaz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The approach won’t work for everyone. The Phase 2 trial focused on people whose tumors had what’s known as mismatch repair deficiency, a mutation that means mistakes in the DNA aren’t fixed when cancer cells replicate. This leads to even more mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For the treatment to work, “the tumors need to have this mutation,” said Dr. Andrea Cercek of Memorial Sloan Kettering. Cercek led the clinical trial and presented the findings at the &lt;a href="https://www.aacr.org/meeting/aacr-annual-meeting-2025/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=21152382950&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAADrBdMT_RFsPg0d8_6DW1lRKXNZdn&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwwqfABhBcEiwAZJjC3p8iqS1RGj8bumvKzKrO5ALMys4qwvrswsSucJZ3DDWPTIT3dMRURhoCvVIQAvD_BwE" target="_blank"&gt;American Association for Cancer Research’s&lt;/a&gt; annual meeting on Sunday in Chicago. The research was simultaneously published in &lt;a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2404512" target="_blank"&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Mismatch repair deficiency occurs &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9582475/" target="_blank"&gt;more frequently&lt;/a&gt; in some cancers than in others. About 16% of ovarian cancers and as much as 30% of endometrial cancers have the mutation, compared to 10%-20% of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959804922004464#:~:text=Microsatellite%20unstable%20(MSI)%20colorectal%20cancers,MMR%20system%20(Lynch%20syndrome)." target="_blank"&gt;colorectal cancers&lt;/a&gt;. Between 8% and 22% of nonmetastatic &lt;a href="https://jnccn.org/view/journals/jnccn/22/3/article-e237103.xml" target="_blank"&gt;gastroesophageal cancers&lt;/a&gt; are mismatch repair deficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Immunotherapy drugs work by teaching a person’s immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. The drugs have been found to work particularly well against tumors with mismatch repair deficiencies, because the many mutations provide more targets for immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, the drugs typically aren’t used as a first-line treatment for these cancers. Instead, they’re brought in if approaches like chemotherapy and radiation don’t work, or if a cancer returns or has already spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The new trial expanded on a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2201445" target="_blank"&gt;smaller study&lt;/a&gt; from Cercek that used the immunotherapy drug dostarlimab as the first treatment in 12 people with rectal cancers that were advanced but had not spread elsewhere in the body. All of the people’s tumors had mismatch repair deficiencies. Everyone underwent immunotherapy treatment for at least six months. At the end of that time, all 12 had a complete response, meaning there was no evidence of the tumor remaining. None of them had to undergo other cancer treatments that would usually be used to treat these types of cancer, including surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The researchers started with rectal cancers because the treatments, and in particular the surgery, can be life-changing. Surgery may involve removing the rectum — the final portion of the large intestine before the anus. Patients who undergo this surgery must have &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/colon-cancer-young-people-describe-signs-ignored-rcna129838" target="_blank"&gt;a colostomy&lt;/a&gt;, an operation where the intestine is rerouted to a hole made in the abdomen for stool to pass out of the body into what’s known as an ostomy bag. “This will have a significant impact on your quality of life,” Diaz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The second part of the trial expanded the treatment to more people, including patients with other cancers known to have mismatch repair deficiencies, including cancers of the esophagus; endometrium; kidney and ureters; and liver, gallbladder and bile ducts. Everyone enrolled in the trial had early-stage cancer, meaning it hadn’t spread to other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Sideris was one of the first people with a noncolorectal cancer to be cleared for the treatment in the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;During her first appointment, Sideris was hooked up to an IV that dripped the immunotherapy into her bloodstream. “Within 45 minutes, it’s done,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Sideris repeated the process every three weeks over the next six months as Cercek and her team enrolled other people who had recently been diagnosed with cancer. They were divided into two categories: those with &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/colon-cancer-young-people-dna-damage-gut-toxin-antibiotics-rcna202572" target="_blank"&gt;colorectal cancers&lt;/a&gt;, and those with the other types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The first group, rectal cancers, included 49 patients who completed six months of immunotherapy. All of them responded to the therapy and didn’t need surgery, chemotherapy or radiation. About 75% of them were still cancer-free a year or more after completing the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In the second group, 54 people completed the six-month treatment, and 35 — about 61% — had complete responses and didn’t need to undergo further treatment. The researchers didn't look at data on the patients’ 12-month results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Sideris said she’s grateful she didn’t have to endure the side effects of chemotherapy, but the immunotherapy did cause kidney failure, a known side effect of the drug. She’s now taking medication to manage the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Still, Sideris said, “it was like winning the lottery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Suneel Kamath, a gastrointestinal medical oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic, cautioned that mismatch repair deficiencies only account for “1%-2% of cancers at most.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Unfortunately, this is not going to be something that is a cure-all,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But for people who do have this type of cancer, the findings offer substantial hope: Cancer surgery can often be “life-altering,” Kamath said. “A huge number might not need surgery at all and can be cured from the immunotherapy alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Diaz said that for patients with mismatch repair deficiency, it may be possible to avoid 80% of surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Being able to preserve people’s organs by avoiding surgery can have a huge effect on quality of life. Depending on the surgery, patients could experience sexual dysfunction, loss of bowel control, acid reflux and infertility. Chemotherapy and radiation can also hurt fertility.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Navigating the endless advice on what to eat for better brain and blood vessel health can leave you feeling dizzy. One day, you’re reading that a specific food contains compounds that can increase your stroke risk, and the next, you’re told that it’s actually packed with beneficial nutrients. This constant back-and-forth is not only exhausting, but it also leaves you feeling confused about what truly belongs on your plate. We asked dietitians to break down the science and share the top six misunderstood foods that may lower your chances of having a stroke.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Nuts&lt;/a&gt; are often tossed aside for their high calorie content. But crack open the truth, and you’ll find those calories come from healthy fats that support your heart and may reduce stroke risk. “The unsaturated fats in nuts are actually very good for cardiovascular health,” says &lt;a href="https://www.meghanpendleton.com/about-us" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Meghan Pendleton, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, of Meghan Pendleton Nutrition, a private practice based in Metro Detroit.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research suggests that munching on nuts at least five times a week may help reduce stroke risk by 19%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But that’s not all. Pendleton shares that nuts are also rich in antioxidants like vitamin E and polyphenols, which help reduce inflammation. “Inflammation is a key process in atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), which can lead to stroke,” she explains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To incorporate more nuts into your diet, try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7881665/everything-seasoned-almonds/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Everything-Seasoned Almonds&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-bananas"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Bananas &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thanks to their higher sugar content, biting into a banana is often put on the “don’t” list when it comes to weight loss and overall health. However, this sweet fruit &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009266/benefits-of-bananas/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;brings much more to the table&lt;/a&gt; than carbohydrates. “They’re actually a great source of potassium, a mineral that can help lower blood pressure,” says &lt;a href="https://theheartdietitian.com/the-heart-dietitian-meet-veronica-rouse/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Veronica Rouse, RD, CDE&lt;/a&gt;, founder of The Heart Dietitian. “Since high blood pressure is one of the leading risk factors for stroke, getting enough potassium each day is an important step in reducing your risk,” she emphasizes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Many Americans &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290730/signs-youre-not-getting-enough-potassium-and-what-to-do-about-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;fall short&lt;/a&gt; of the recommended intake of 4,700 milligrams of potassium each day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fortunately, you can easily boost your intake by adding banana slices to a parfait or tossing frozen bananas into the blender for a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/251254/almond-butter-banana-protein-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;creamy smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-coffee"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Coffee &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For many, coffee is a daily pick-me-up, but its impact on stroke risk often brews debate. “Good news: You don’t need to give up your morning coffee. While caffeine can cause a temporary rise in blood pressure, it doesn’t appear to contribute to sustained high blood pressure over time. In fact, moderate [filtered] coffee consumption (2 to 3 cups per day) has been linked to a lower risk of stroke in long-term studies,” says Rouse.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; is best known for its caffeine content, this beloved beverage is also brimming with antioxidants, such as chlorogenic acid and flavonoids, that contribute to its stroke-protective properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But there’s a catch: Rouse warns that higher intake could increase stroke risk, so it’s best to cap your cup of joe habit at no more than 3 cups a day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-oatmeal"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Oatmeal &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Long regarded as an artery-friendly grain, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7996442/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-oatmeal-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;oatmeal&lt;/a&gt; has faced some undeserved skepticism for its impact on blood sugar. “Some people are afraid to eat oatmeal due to concerns about it spiking blood sugar. However, you can build a bowl of oatmeal in a smart way, while still gaining the heart-healthy benefits of beta-glucan, a type of soluble fiber known for its cholesterol-lowering effects,” says Pendleton.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Oats also contain phenolic compounds that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and are linked to reduced stroke risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To reap these benefits, Pendleton recommends choosing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7989862/steel-cut-rolled-or-instant-oats-which-is-the-healthiest/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;steel-cut or rolled oats&lt;/a&gt; over instant oats, which are more processed and may be more rapidly digested. She also advises pairing your oatmeal with a source of protein, healthy fat and extra fiber, like in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/251317/oatmeal-with-fruit-nuts/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Oatmeal with Fruit &amp;amp; Nuts&lt;/a&gt;, to make your breakfast a more well-rounded meal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-beans"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Beans &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Beans are an excellent, affordable food to help improve cardiovascular health, despite getting a bad rap about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7827647/what-is-the-lectin-free-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lectins&lt;/a&gt; through misinformation on social media,” says Pendleton. Lectins are proteins associated with symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The reality is that properly soaking and cooking beans helps to neutralize lectins, making them not only safe but incredibly nutritious.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pendleton highlights that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053850/are-beans-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;beans&lt;/a&gt; are rich in artery-protective soluble fiber. This fiber binds to cholesterol in the intestines and removes it through the stool. Studies suggest that this effect plays a major role in reducing stroke mortality.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Beans are also rich in potassium and magnesium, making them a powerhouse for heart and brain health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If beans aren’t already a staple in your diet, check out our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sweet-potato-black-bean-tostadas-8769923" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Sweet Potato-Black Bean Tostadas&lt;/a&gt; for a hearty dish that is flavorful and satisfying.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-tofu"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Tofu &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tofu often gets dismissed as a “fake” food that disrupts your hormones, but there’s no evidence that this plant-powered protein is harmful—in fact, it can be &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291534/is-tofu-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;incredibly beneficial&lt;/a&gt;. Made from soybeans through a natural curdling process (similar to cheese), tofu has been a staple ingredient in Asian cuisine for centuries. “Tofu is rich in isoflavones, a type of antioxidant that can support healthy blood pressure. A meta-analysis found that higher consumption of soy products like tofu was linked to a lower risk of stroke,” says Rouse.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Along with enjoying the foods and drinks mentioned above, both dietitians suggest embracing these lifestyle and dietary habits to further reduce your risk of stroke:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow the Mediterranean or DASH diet: &lt;/strong&gt;These diets are rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, with moderate amounts of fish, lean protein and low-fat dairy. They also emphasize limiting processed foods and added sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get moving: &lt;/strong&gt;Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise, like walking or biking, per week. In addition, dedicate two days a week to muscle-strengthening exercises like lifting weights.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quit smoking: &lt;/strong&gt;When you give up smoking, your risk of having a stroke goes down significantly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Try making a list of reasons why you want to quit, setting a date and outlining a plan to combat nicotine cravings. A health care professional can also help navigate you through this process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure you’re getting seven to nine hours of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2060332/what-happens-to-your-body-if-you-dont-get-enough-sleep/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; each night. It’s also important to get treatment if you have sleep apnea, which is linked to increased stroke risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are many misconceptions about what you should and shouldn’t eat to lower your stroke risk. Unfortunately, many foods are labeled as “bad” based on half-truths that are not firmly rooted in science. The full truth is that many of these foods—like nuts, bananas, coffee, oatmeal, tofu and beans—contain beneficial compounds that can reduce stroke risk. So, the next time you come across a post that dismisses a food based on one component of its nutritional profile, reach out to a dietitian or a health care professional to clear up the confusion. After all, eating to improve your brain and heart health should be enjoyable, and plenty of foods can fit seamlessly into a balanced diet.&lt;br&gt;

However, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ct-scans-radiation-cancer-diagnoses-study/"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; reports there could be a troubling side effect: a potential long-term cancer risk linked to radiation exposure. In a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778?guestAccessKey=afde7c2e-df6b-4e7b-9ced-7a15ed74dc1d&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=041425"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; at &lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;, researchers estimate that CT scans performed in 2023 alone could ultimately lead to around 103,000 cases of radiation-induced cancer over the lifetimes of the patients exposed. The study's authors wrote, "If current practices persist, CT-related cancer could eventually account for 5% of all new cancer diagnoses annually."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        And the projected cancer risks aren't distributed evenly. While children and adolescents are more vulnerable to radiation, adults undergo CT scans more frequently, so they account for the majority of the projected cases. The scans most commonly linked to future cancers were abdominal and pelvic CTs, followed by chest scans. The most frequent resulting cancers included lung, colon, leukemia, and bladder cancers, with breast cancer ranking second among female patients. And the study stresses that CT technology is essential, but that it must be used judiciously—with a growing need to weigh the benefits of fast, accurate imaging against potential long-term harm.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        This isn't the first time radiation from CT scans has been scrutinized. A &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/01/the-surprising-dangers-of-ct-sans-and-x-rays/index.htm"&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/a&gt; investigation in 2015 found that up to a third of all CT scans could be medically unnecessary, while experts warn it could be difficult to limit CT imaging because its speed and relative affordability have made it ubiquitous. Still, the study's editors say the new projections should be taken seriously, likening CT-induced cancer risk to other established risk factors like alcohol consumption and obesity. As part of the solution, they recommend using radiation-free imaging alternatives when possible, lowering radiation doses in CT protocols, and educating clinicians to avoid unnecessary scans.

Someone weighing 185lbs would burn 56 calories per hour, totaling 392 to 504 calories burned per night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not everyone will burn the same calories at the same rate, Dr Cassidy Jenkins, a psychology expert at Welltech, explained - saying it all depends on &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-9887363/Metabolism-Rate-calorie-burning-stays-stable-decades-doesnt-decline-youre-SIXTY.html"&gt;a person's basal metabolic rate (BMR)&lt;/a&gt;, the number of calories your body burns at rest to maintain basic bodily functions like breathing and circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And each person's BMR is influenced by factors such as weight, age, sex, and overall health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, the ability to burn any number of calories without hitting the gym is appealing to even the laziest of couch potatoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Getting a full night’s sleep burns hundreds of calories. While the body rests every night, it undergoes a range of processes to repair tissues, consolidate memories, conserve energy, and regulate hormone levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anyone can check their nightly calorie burn by calculating their BMR. For men, the formula is as follows: 66 + (6.2 multiplied by weight in pounds) + (12.7 multiplied by height in inches) – (6.76 multiplied by age in years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women can calculate their BMR using the formula: 655.1 + (4.35 multiplied by weight in pounds) + (4.7 multiplied by height in inches) – (4.7 multiplied by age in years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Online calculators can also easily determine your BMR. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Once you’ve calculated your BMR, divide that number by 24 [to get your hourly calorie burn], then multiply it by the number of hours you typically sleep,’ Dr Jenkin explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to BMR, the number of calories burned at night also depends on a person’s body mass and composition, age, sex, sleep quality, and underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recommended number of hours of sleep to aim for per night are seven to nine. During this time, the body undergoes approximately four to six sleep cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When falling asleep, the body transitions from light sleep to deep sleep, and then to REM sleep, where dreaming occurs most frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;REM burns the most calories. During this phase, the brain is highly active, processing emotions and consolidating memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heart rate and breathing become irregular and sometimes faster, while the body’s normal ability to regulate temperature becomes less efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This raises the body’s demand for energy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the dreaming that occurs in the brain in this stage also requires fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A majority of U.S. adults, 57 percent, say they would feel better if they got more sleep, while 42 percent say they get as much sleep as they need&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While burning up to 500 calories doing nothing sounds nice, sleeping shouldn't be a substitute for regular exercise, Dr Jenkins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘While these totals are surprisingly significant, about the same calorie burn as a 30 to 45-minute walk, that doesn’t mean you should skip regular physical activity.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: ‘Instead, it highlights the important role rest and recovery play in your overall wellness and weight management.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly 84million Americans struggle to get the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep every night and a&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/642704/americans-sleeping-less-stressed.aspx"&gt; survey&lt;/a&gt; by Gallup reported approximately 57 percent of Americans would feel better if they could get more sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 20 percent of Americans &lt;a target="_self" href="/wellness-us/article-13092389/Sleeping-fewer-seven-hours-heart-disease.html"&gt;sleep five hours or fewer every night, a habit that deprives the brain of crucial nightly rejuvenation and the body of necessary hormone and energy regulation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sleep deprivation also raises cortisol levels, which can encourage fat storage and disrupts hunger hormones, such as ghrelin and leptin, thereby increasing appetite and cravings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, sleep deprivation can slow down metabolism and impair decision-making, often leading to unhealthy food choices and late-night snacking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Together, these effects are linked to a higher risk of metabolic disorders and obesity - which impacts about 42 percent of Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Routinely sleeping less than six or seven hours a night demolishes your immune system and significantly raises your risk of developing numerous forms of cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To get the most out of those seven to nine hours of sleep, Dr Jenkins recommends establishing a consistent sleep schedule. Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day will help strengthen your body's natural sleep cycle, also known as your circadian rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Creating a sleep environment that encourages restful sleep is also crucial, Dr Jenkins said: ‘You should avoid going to sleep in a room that’s too hot or too cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘A cool space (around 65 degrees) that’s dark and quiet promotes a deeper, more restorative sleep, which is essential for metabolic recovery.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, she said, prioritize physical exercise during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Regular exercise, in particular resistance training, boosts muscle mass and raises your BMR, increasing the number of calories you’re likely to burn during your sleep,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise also helps regulate the body’s circadian rhythm, reduces stress, and boosts the production of melatonin, a sleep hormone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

So they turned to the Autistic Translator, an AI tool where you type in a situation you’re trying to understand, and it gives the unspoken nuances of social situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3WRWI4A7MBCJDBXKDXQR5MJSJU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After describing their situation,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the translator generated a response: In bullet points, the AI told Pierce how their persistent questions and search for feedback was interpreted by their supervisors as incompetence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XENAH4SARFFKXBF6NL6RWIXY7E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It was kind of eye opening for me,” Pierce said.

Some autism researchers have found reasons to be optimistic about AI’s value, saying it can be a great companion to other therapeutic tools.

The tools can help users confirm their comprehension of an interaction or event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5SXKT4OFMNAE3EJMILZTOJFQIE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But Laugeson remains cautious about AI’s use beyond general yes or no prompts.

Its founder, Michael Daniel, who is autistic and has attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), says its instant responses make the AI chatbot helpful and popular among users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GKVQHLHBH5GYLIW7NLEH6YAADM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I found it really took the emotional sting out of the situation and helped process through those things much faster than I normally would’ve,” Daniel said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GPHGRXJO7FF2VGILU3WZ3PJ7TI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The 34-year-old created Autistic Translator from his home in Newcastle, Australia, after losing his job in August. Daniel, who also&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;has a daughter with autism and a son with ADHD, said living in a home with different neurotypes made communicating hard. If he could use AI to communicate at work, he could use it to do the same at home, he thought. Daniel released the AI tool to the public via a Reddit post, garnering thousands of positive interactions overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5NFIIB64LJAM5O5FJG7GRJB7GY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Using his background as a data analyst, Daniel built the translator using OpenAI’s ChatGPT models.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; Today, he says it has more than 3,000 downloads, and it costs $4 to $12 a month depending on the tier. Since then, Daniel made the service into an app called NeuroTranslator and expanded its translation capabilities to users with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7KI5UTYJYRAU7LGQQXAS74E4XI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are other tools that claim to help neurodiverse people. Bram De Buyser created Goblin Tools, a website that offers eight different AI chatbot tools geared for all neurotypes. Users can ask questions or put down their scrambled thoughts into different AI tools to mitigate tasks such as creating to-do lists, mapping out tasks, and weighing pros and cons. While Goblin Tools doesn’t translate social situations, tools like “The Formalizer” help users convey their thoughts in the way they want it to come across to avoid miscommunication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FOGJCKCJ3JAZHL4RNCYD2YWEDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;AI tools are particularly popular among people on the autism spectrum because unlike humans, AI never gets tired of answering questions, De Buyser said in an interview. “They don’t tire, they don’t get frustrated, and they don’t judge the user for asking anything that a neurotypical might consider weird or out of place,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4C6C57GU6BEABNMIZTVGRISJBM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Lawrence Fung, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University, said the Autistic Translator can be a great tool to improve communication and articulate what is going on in their social settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UY4HVAG3QBEV3OUI7DAH4JX77M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I think that they can definitely learn from it,” Fung said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SEEAMNZW6NFR5NJOLSNREZ5DPE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However, autistic people don’t always get the whole picture and because the AI is reliant on the user’s understanding of the situation, it can result in inaccurate outputs, Fung said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VYBPQHL36ZCLJME62EKHMZY4CM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For 22-year-old Eva Dale,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;understanding the entire picture of certain social situations&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;can be a challenge. The bakery worker from Connecticut often finds that people say one thing when they really mean another. Deciphering what people mean isn’t intuitive for Dale, who has autism and relies on direct translations from her mom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZXEZPVMKO5HWZNNBDUUXTIHVBM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;During one instance, Dale’s grandmother mentioned multiple times that her dog needed to go out, meaning it needed to be walked, but Dale interpreted it literally to take the dog outside. Later, Dale’s mom explained that her grandmother was really asking her to walk the dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PBOMCKIALBHRDPV3RERO3S6ESE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“A lot of times, people say something like the dog has to go out, and it means a secret message like ‘Will you take the dog out?’ They won’t tell you the secret message and expect you to know it,” Dale said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HHYNSM6BW5A3JLJWKCV3DM3TKI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Skeptical, Dale entered the interaction into the Autistic Translator.

After coming across the Autistic Translator on Reddit, Phillip Lee, a 28-year-old from California, tested out the AI tool on multiple occasions but ultimately decided that he’d prefer to get feedback from the people around him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LDIFVVEYIZDG3EA62WML6BUCOQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Understanding tone, social cues and other nonverbal language has always been a challenge for Lee, who has autism and ADHD. He was reprimanded last year by his graduate program committee for delivering jokes at inappropriate times. He also heard from his peers and colleagues that his blunt tone and lack of eye contact came off as dismissive. Frustrated, Lee sought to better understand his cognitive difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BRUE512F2D3GV27Z9CNZY9F1Q8" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Asking the translator how people perceive his mannerisms helped Lee clarify some things, like when he asked the AI: “Why do people get mad when I don’t smile?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UJGPFF3WXZFI7LF4ZJ52IGLAEQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The translator responded, “Neurotypicals often rely on smiles as a nonverbal cue for friendliness, while this might not be a natural expression for autistics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5QVUM73DDBCBHNCAZVNNFQV4PE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This made sense to Lee. As he entered more specific scenarios from his personal life such as “Why do I get so angry?” the responses grew more vague and general, sometimes not even getting a response at all because of the complicated nature of the questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MZK5TPE4JJDD7FPBYE5ZNW5ZGA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Daniel says that users are given a disclaimer about the translator’s capabilities, and that people don’t have to agree with everything the AI tool says. The Autistic Translator is programmed to acknowledge and redirect any questions about complex topics like violence, drugs and medical advice and divert back to communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2IV26NHOW5CIFA3TOUG5ISUOWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Wary of the AI’s ability to factor in the context and dynamics of his life, Lee prefers to hear feedback directly from his colleagues and family now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RYWTEPPNV5ENTFS4UAIPORYWQQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s informational but not holistic enough to suffice as a solution for everything,” Lee said of the AI tool. “There is no road map nor a flowchart because the autistic experience is an individualized experience that requires so much time and patience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D3MLAXHDC5C57HVVZOO6JQTFTE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As for Pierce, the translator recently helped them navigate a tricky relationship question.

Drawing on a large sample of students in New York City public schools, the study found that each standard deviation increase in height was associated with modestly higher scores in both English Language Arts and math across grades 3 through 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted this study to better understand why taller individuals often earn higher wages in adulthood, a pattern well-documented in prior research. One possible explanation is that taller individuals may have had academic advantages earlier in life, which could partly explain their later success in the labor market. While previous studies hinted at a link between height and early academic performance, this research aimed to examine that relationship more directly using a large, recent dataset from a major urban school district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a well-known result in the social sciences that taller men and women have higher earnings than shorter ones in countries all over the world,” said Stephanie Coffey, an assistant professor of economics at Saint Anselm College, who conducted the research along with Amy Ellen Schwartz of the University of Delaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research has offered a few possible explanations for the phenomenon. One explanation is social channels (i.e. taller people may be more self-confident, or may be perceived more positively by others). Another is that height is positively associated with ability (taller individuals tend to score higher on tests of cognitive ability than shorter ones). So, maybe it’s ability that is rewarded on the labor market, rather than height &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since academic achievement is an important determinant of eventual earnings, we were curious whether taller children might similarly perform better on state standardized tests during school. A great dataset from the New York City Department of Education that has annual measures of height and test scores for students enrolled in NYC public schools facilitated the analysis. A huge plus of these data is that they allow us to compare students directly to their peers within the same school.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dataset included longitudinal data from nearly 500,000 students enrolled in New York City public schools between 2010 and 2017. It contained detailed records of student height measurements, standardized test scores in math and English Language Arts, demographic characteristics, and other information such as obesity status and school attendance. Height was standardized relative to same-sex, same-grade peers within each school to capture a student’s height standing among classmates. The researchers then used regression models to examine how differences in height related to differences in test performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings showed a consistent, though small, association between height and academic achievement. Among boys, each one standard deviation increase in height was associated with a 0.03 standard deviation increase in math scores and a 0.039 standard deviation increase in English scores. Among girls, the corresponding increases were 0.034 and 0.04 standard deviations. Although these numbers may seem small, they add up over time. For instance, the tallest 2.5% of boys and girls in their grade performed around 0.18 to 0.19 standard deviations better in English compared to the shortest 2.5%, a difference that can be meaningful in large-scale educational assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our primary finding is that boys and girls who are taller than their grade mates score higher in math and English Language Arts in every grade between 3-8 (the years in which tests are administered),” Coffey told PsyPost. “The size of the effect is small on average, but large enough to yield substantial disparities in achievement between the tallest and shortest kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, after we control for some basic demographic characteristics, the tallest 2.5% of boys and girls score about 20% of one standard deviation higher in English Language arts than the shortest 2.5% of boys and girls in the same grade and school. An educational intervention is typically viewed as having a meaningful impact if it improves test scores by 10% of one standard deviation, so we consider this to be a pretty large effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study found that height relative to classmates, not just absolute height, also appeared to matter. Students who ranked higher in height compared to their peers tended to do slightly better in English, even after accounting for their actual height. This suggests that social perceptions tied to being taller than one’s peers might play a small role in academic performance, at least in language-related subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something else our data allow us explore whether it is simply being &lt;em&gt;tall&lt;/em&gt; that explains the effect, or being &lt;em&gt;taller&lt;/em&gt; than peers specifically,” Coffey explained. “We can tease this out because the distribution of height varies between schools, so a student may be relatively tall or short for his grade depending on the heights of his peers. Essentially, our estimates show that if you compare two students of the same height in the same grade (but at different schools) the student who attends a school where he is relatively tall compared to peers will score slightly higher in English Language Arts than the same-height student who attends a school where he is relatively short. This suggests that social benefits of height are at least part of the story.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An important part of the study was testing whether health could explain the relationship between height and achievement. Taller students might be healthier, and healthier students might perform better in school. To examine this possibility, the researchers controlled for obesity status and found that the relationship between height and achievement actually grew stronger after accounting for obesity. They also tested whether taller students were less likely to miss school, finding very little evidence that absenteeism played a meaningful role. This suggests that the observed height-achievement link is unlikely to be explained by better health among taller students alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address the possibility that family background or early childhood conditions might explain both greater height and better academic performance, the researchers estimated models that controlled for each student’s fixed characteristics over time. Once they accounted for these unchanging traits, the relationship between height and test scores weakened considerably, but still remained statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think what surprised us most was how robust the height achievement relationship is,” Coffey told PsyPost. “We find it in both math and English Language Arts achievement in every grade between 3-8 and for every racial/ethnic group we look at. Given social norms around height, we thought the ‘height premium’ might be larger for boys, but we found very similar effects for boys and girls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings are robust across multiple statistical models, the study does have limitations. The researchers could not directly measure early childhood conditions, such as prenatal health or family socioeconomic status during infancy, which likely contribute to both height and academic performance. Nor could they fully separate the effects of social treatment based on height from the effects of innate ability or other factors. Although the fixed-effects models help address some of these concerns, they cannot completely rule out all potential sources of bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main caveat is that we’re limited in our ability to uncover the underlying mechanisms that drive the academic height premium,” Coffey noted. “We looked at attendance and found that shorter kids really aren’t absent more frequently than taller ones, so we don’t think it’s about health. However, it’s difficult to untangle how much of the effect might arise through early childhood advantage (that leads kids to be tall and to do well in school) vs. any social benefits of height &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re interested in exploring, more generally, how physical characteristics shape the way kids experience school. One way we could extend our research on height is by looking into the NYC School Climate Survey, which asks students about how they perceive the school environment, teachers and peers. We’ve also discussed the possibility of conducting similar analyses looking at childhood obesity rather than height. Something else we think might be very interesting is exploring how the switch to online schooling during Covid may have affected these relationships. Does your height matter if your peers only view you through Zoom?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ehb.2025.101488" target="_blank"&gt;Towering Intellects?

Using a patented immuno-infrared sensor (iRS) technology, they measured the misfolding of the alpha-synuclein (αSyn) protein, a key driver of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early diagnosis is crucial, as clinical symptoms usually appear only after severe and irreversible brain damage.

Moreover, diagnosis is difficult and often incorrect because the disease takes many forms and symptoms overlap with other disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109228"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Dopamine supplements can compensate for the loss and temporarily alleviate the symptoms. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the PRODI Center for Protein Diagnostics at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, and the biotech company betaSENSE have now discovered a biomarker in the spinal fluid that facilitates a reliable diagnosis at an early stage and can shed light on the progression of the disease and the effect of a therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They report their findings in the journal &lt;em&gt;EMBO Molecular Medicine on&lt;/em&gt; April 25, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parkinson’s disease – an unstoppable condition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic nerve cells in the brain, which usually leads to increasing motor impairments as the symptoms progress. Dopamine supplements can compensate for the loss and temporarily alleviate the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The misfolding of the key protein alpha-synuclein (αSyn) from α-helical structures to β-sheet-rich structures plays a crucial role in the development of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These misfoldings make the protein sticky, leading to the formation of larger complexes, so-called oligomers. The oligomers then produce long fibrillar filaments and cause the aggregation of these filaments into macroscopically large Lewy bodies in the brain,” explains Professor Klaus Gerwert, founding and managing director at PRODI and CEO of betaSENSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced platform technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In two independent clinical cohorts with a total of 134 participants, the Bochum-based researchers showed that, with a sensitivity and specificity of well over 90 percent, this misfolding of αSyn in body-fluids is a viable biomarker for the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted using cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients at the Parkinson’s centers in Bochum (St. Josef Hospital, Professor Lars Tönges, Professor Ralf Gold) and Kassel (Paracelsus-Elena-Klinik, Dr. Sandrina Weber, Professor Brit Mollenhauer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measurements were carried out using the patented iRS (immuno-infrared sensor) technology from betaSENSE GmbH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;betaSENSE has already successfully implemented the iRS technology for diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease. In this case, it was shown that the misfolding of the biomarker Aβ can indicate the risk of Alzheimer’s dementia at a later stage with high accuracy up to 17 years before clinical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have now transferred this approach to Parkinson’s for the misfolding of αSyn,” stresses Klaus Gerwert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development of Parkinson’s drugs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to diagnostic applications, the technology can also help to develop new active substances and prove their efficacy in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Parkinson’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b4dec1d8ddd59ac3d1ddd8d1c6f4c6c1d69ad0d1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Julia Weiler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://rub.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RUB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Julia Weiler – RUB&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s44321-025-00229-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alpha-synuclein Misfolding as Fluid Biomarker for Parkinson’s Disease Measured with the iRS Platform&lt;/a&gt;” by Klaus Gerwert et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;EMBO Molecular Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alpha-synuclein Misfolding as Fluid Biomarker for Parkinson’s Disease Measured with the iRS Platform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misfolding and aggregation of alpha-synuclein (αSyn) play a key role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Despite considerable advances in diagnostics, an early and differential diagnosis of PD still represents a major challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We innovated the immuno-infrared sensor (iRS) platform for measuring αSyn misfolding. We analyzed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from two cohorts comprising PD cases, atypical Parkinsonian disorders, and disease controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We obtained an AUC of 0.90 (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 134, 95% CI 0.85–0.96) for separating PD/MSA from controls by determination of the αSyn misfolding by iRS. Using two thresholds divided individuals as unaffected/affected by misfolding with an intermediate area in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing the affected/unaffected cases, controls versus PD/MSA cases were classified with 97% sensitivity and 92% specificity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spectral data revealed misfolding from an α-helical/random-coil αSyn in controls to β-sheet enriched αSyn in PD and MSA cases. Moreover, a first subgroup analysis implied the potential for patient stratification in clinically overlapping cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The iRS, directly measuring all αSyn conformers, is complementary to the αSyn seed-amplification assays (SAAs), which however only amplify seeding competent conformers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 14:10:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5SM2hUcGczYlFWQTM1aTNfNEtzVGJoc3FjeXFHWjZFQ0sxUmgxVHJNNW1OM3NNQjFYYmpuQUREWWNWcm12M20weGRMdlUycXE2bVU5bW8zSk90bEtJYjJlcEJCM3lodTRTN2lzZzhwUmlOZk14</guid></item><item><title>根据专家的说法，如果你不吃早餐，你的身体会发生什么。- Stewartville Star | Here’s what happens to your body if you skip breakfast, according to an expert. - Stewartville Star</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxPQzE2TVdwa3B2NUY5VjlXZmpJa2V0cnM2dXVOUk9NQTBOTS1LTlVYZlJlOVRPakJYZ3lqNmtqM0xmWGJjeXFMWmN2Ul9hX090X1FzYmNSano5aGt2Uy1Jb0N3eHotSmdEai1ZTGM1Sk1aU1llMDB4ZlQxQmlRN0tza0dYSDVDZXhoSHBWWHdLcEZuUl82aDVtNVBuSTRYQmsxSTlnRWhlazFSenV1Nnk3RFZBdzNaRXZmOGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking the overnight fast with a morning meal has long been considered a nutritional cornerstone. Yet, millions regularly skip breakfast, either through habit or deliberate intermittent fasting practices. A nutrition expert has recently revealed surprising effects this common habit has on your body, challenging conventional wisdom about the “most important meal of the day.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-1"&gt;The surprising metabolic impact of skipping breakfast&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you finish your evening meal around 8 PM, your body begins a natural fasting period. By midnight, your blood sugar typically returns to normal levels. By 6 AM, after approximately ten hours without food, your digestive system has essentially reset itself. If you then continue to delay your first meal, your metabolism enters an interesting state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-in-text" id="think-2761774683"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The twelve-hour mark is when your body transitions to fat-burning mode,” explains dietitian Wintertok7, who has studied breakfast habits extensively. “Around 10 AM, this fat-burning process accelerates significantly, especially if you’ve incorporated morning exercise into your routine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/04/25/heres-the-actual-distance-you-should-walk-every-day-to-get-back-in-shape/"&gt;
                        &lt;span class="label dynamic"&gt;Well being&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Here’s the actual distance you should walk every day to get back in shape.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This metabolic shift represents the core benefit many intermittent fasting enthusiasts seek. By extending the overnight fast until midday, your body maintains this fat-burning state for longer periods. Breaking your fast around noon with a protein-rich meal that includes healthy fats and fiber helps maintain stable blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-adsense-2" id="think-1422578327"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that this approach may help avoid insulin spikes that typically follow carbohydrate-heavy breakfast options. For those working toward &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/02/01/doctor-reveals-five-hidden-effects-of-stopping-alcohol-for-30-days-has-on-the-brain/"&gt;specific health goals&lt;/a&gt;, this metabolic advantage could complement other healthy habits like reducing alcohol consumption.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-2"&gt;Energy regulation and cognitive function without morning meals&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Morning fasting creates distinct energy patterns throughout the day. Without the immediate glucose influx from breakfast, your body maintains more stable energy levels by drawing from fat stores. This can prevent the mid-morning energy crashes many experience after consuming sugar-laden breakfast options.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, cognitive function responses vary significantly between individuals. Some report enhanced mental clarity during extended morning fasts, while others experience concentration difficulties, irritability, or decreased productivity. These variations often relate to metabolic flexibility—how efficiently your body switches between glucose and fat for fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/04/15/heres-what-to-do-if-you-wake-up-in-the-middle-of-the-night-and-cant-get-back-to-sleep-according-to-this-expert/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Here’s what to do if you wake up in the middle of the night and can’t get back to sleep, according to this expert&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nutrition expert Nicci Roscoe notes, “While intermittent fasting works beautifully for some, others genuinely need that morning metabolic kickstart to function optimally.” Individual factors like sleep quality, stress levels, and activity demands all influence your morning nutritional needs.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those seeking to improve their mental resilience, breakfast timing may be worth examining. The relationship between nutritional habits and psychological fortitude is complex, as demonstrated in studies of &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/11/30/people-who-recover-quickly-failure-tend-display-these-8-traits/"&gt;traits associated with resilience&lt;/a&gt;. Your breakfast choices—or decision to skip—may influence how effectively you handle daily challenges.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-3"&gt;Who should reconsider the breakfast-skipping trend&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite potential benefits for some, breakfast remains crucial for specific populations. Growing children and adolescents typically require regular morning nutrition to support development and academic performance. Athletes with high energy demands often benefit from early fueling to optimize training quality and recovery.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with blood sugar regulation issues, including diabetes or hypoglycemia, should approach breakfast skipping cautiously. Similarly, those taking certain medications requiring food or experiencing certain digestive conditions may need consistent morning meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/04/05/after-knee-surgery-a-17yo-teenager-forgets-his-native-language/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;After knee surgery, a 17yo teenager forgets his native language.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those juggling busy schedules, combining breakfast skipping with &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/05/is-walking-1-mile-per-day-enough-to-reap-health-benefits-experts-weigh-in/"&gt;simple exercise habits like daily walking&lt;/a&gt; may provide manageable health improvements. However, breakfast timing should complement rather than complicate your overall wellness approach.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People struggling with disordered eating patterns should be particularly mindful about meal timing strategies. What begins as intermittent fasting can sometimes reinforce problematic relationships with food. Working with nutrition professionals helps ensure fasting practices support rather than undermine health goals.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-4"&gt;Finding your optimal breakfast strategy&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than viewing breakfast habits through a rigid lens, nutrition experts increasingly recommend personalized approaches based on individual responses. Self-experimentation with different meal timing patterns—while tracking energy, hunger, mood, and performance metrics—can reveal your optimal strategy.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you decide breakfast benefits you, prioritize protein-rich options while minimizing sugar and caffeine. This approach provides sustained energy without dramatic blood sugar fluctuations. For those who thrive without breakfast, ensuring adequate nutrition during eating windows becomes especially important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/04/04/how-long-should-you-walk-per-day-for-effective-weight-loss-a-fitness-coach-explains/"&gt;

                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developing self-awareness around hunger signals represents a crucial skill regardless of your breakfast preference. Learning to distinguish between habitual eating, emotional hunger, and true physiological need helps create sustainable nutrition patterns that &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/12/20/if-you-want-boost-your-confidence-say-goodbye-these-8-self-doubting-behaviors/"&gt;boost confidence in your health decisions&lt;/a&gt;.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that nutritional needs evolve with life circumstances. During particularly demanding periods, you might benefit from adjusting your breakfast approach. Remaining flexible rather than dogmatic allows for adaptation to changing requirements.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, protect your dietary choices from unnecessary social pressure. Whether you’re a breakfast enthusiast or prefer extended morning fasts, learning &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/12/15/8-ways-protect-your-peace-when-dealing-toxic-people/"&gt;techniques to protect your peace&lt;/a&gt; when others challenge your well-considered habits helps maintain consistent nutrition practices.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breakfast debate highlights a broader nutritional truth: individualization matters more than universal rules. By understanding your unique metabolic responses, lifestyle demands, and personal preferences, you can develop morning nutrition habits that truly serve your health goals—whether that includes breakfast or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/04/03/this-little-known-leafy-vegetable-is-actually-the-secret-to-youth-among-the-japanese-and-koreans/"&gt;

More specifically, the study found that eating 150 grams or more of processed meat per week increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by 46% and the risk of early death by 50%, compared to eating no processed meat. The study authors also noted that processed meat consists of any type of meat that is “salted, cured, or treated with preservatives and/or food additives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While removing foods like processed meats from your diet (or limiting them) is a great way to stay healthy, keeping your heart health in check requires a multifaceted approach consisting of not only a healthy diet but also proper exercise and lifestyle choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for even more ways to protect your heart, try taking our &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a63743032/heart-health-quiz/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart health quiz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart health quiz&lt;/a&gt; to see how well you know the organ.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;SIBO is the result of an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Subtle signs of SIBO include nutritional deficiencies, rosacea, brain fog and fatigue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meet with a health care provider to discuss testing and treatment options.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diverse microbiome&lt;/a&gt; is essential for overall health. However, having an excessive amount of bacteria in the small intestine can cause serious problems.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) can cause a number of unpleasant digestive side effects and affect other areas of the body as well. “SIBO can be tricky to identify because its symptoms can mimic other digestive disorders,” says &lt;a href="https://kayteehadley.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kaytee Hadley, M.S., RDN, IFMCP,&lt;/a&gt; a functional medicine dietitian specializing in SIBO and founder of Holistic Health and Wellness in Richmond, Virginia. In fact, the only way to know whether you have SIBO is by getting tested. “The most accessible way to test for SIBO is through a breath test, which measures levels of hydrogen, methane and hydrogen sulfide gases produced by bacteria in the small intestine,” says Hadley. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to digestive symptoms, there are less-obvious signals that you may have SIBO and should make an appointment with a health care provider. “While the classic signs include bloating, gas and altered bowel habits, many people experience more subtle symptoms like fatigue, brain fog or nutrient deficiencies, such as low vitamin B12 or iron,” says &lt;a href="https://allieddigestivehealth.com/providers/ritu-nahar-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ritu Nahar, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; a gastroenterologist with Allied Digestive Health. Here’s a closer look at four sneaky signs to be aware of. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-nutrient-deficiencies"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Nutrient Deficiencies  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; SIBO can result in malabsorption of nutrients, including iron and vitamins A, D, E and B12.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The small intestine is where the majority of nutrient absorption occurs. However, because it interferes with bile acids, which are needed to break down and absorb fats, SIBO can make it harder for your body to absorb fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K. Bacterial overgrowth can also affect &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7676216/sneaky-signs-you-could-have-iron-deficiency/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;iron levels&lt;/a&gt;, as up to 20% of iron is absorbed in the small intestine. As for vitamin B12, SIBO can both reduce the absorption and increase the use of this essential vitamin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, because SIBO can cause nausea and loss of appetite, it may result in a more limited diet, which further increases the risk of nutritional inadequacies or deficiencies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Changes in mood, brittle nails, thinning hair and increased fatigue are common symptoms of vitamin and mineral deficiencies, though the only way to know for sure is by having blood work done by a health care provider.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-brain-fog"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Brain Fog &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The gut and brain &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8001367/poor-gut-health-increases-anxiety-depression-risk-what-to-eat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;are strongly connected&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s no surprise that SIBO can affect cognitive functioning. Brain fog is defined as periods of mental confusion, impaired judgment, poor short-term memory and difficulty concentrating that come and go.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; People with SIBO may experience these symptoms shortly after eating, or on and off throughout the day. A small study found that among people with unexplained gas, bloating and abdominal pain, those who also experienced brain fog were more likely to have SIBO and D-lactic acidosis—a condition caused by the accumulation of D-lactic acid due to an overgrowth of certain bacteria.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-fatigue-after-eating"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Fatigue After Eating &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to brain fog, SIBO can lead to extreme fatigue, which may be especially noticeable right after eating. While this fatigue may be linked to brain fog, it could also be caused by low &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-b12-benefits-8676211" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt; levels, resulting from impaired absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-rosacea-or-dry-skin"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Rosacea or Dry Skin &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Rosacea is a skin disorder that can cause flushing and persistent redness and dryness on the face. While &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7906387/best-worst-foods-for-rosacea/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;certain foods may exacerbate symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, the cause of rosacea is unknown. That said, research suggests that the condition may be tied to your gut.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Rosacea has been associated with SIBO and may improve once you get rid of the bacterial overgrowth,” says Hadley. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-strategies-to-manage-sibo"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Strategies to Manage SIBO &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once you’ve confirmed with your doctor that you have SIBO, what can you do? The experts we spoke with recommend a multifaceted approach that may include some combination of antibiotics, herbal antimicrobials and dietary changes. “Long-term success also depends on addressing the root cause, whether that’s impaired gut motility, previous surgeries or other contributing factors,” says Nahar. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are some potential strategies your doctor or dietitian may suggest: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Medications to Reduce the Bacterial Count&lt;/strong&gt;: “Managing SIBO starts with getting rid of the bacterial overgrowth itself,” says Hadley. Your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic or herbal antimicrobial to reduce the amount of bacteria in your small intestine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try a Short-Term Elemental Diet: &lt;/strong&gt;A short-term elemental diet, which includes packaged medical-grade food products, works by starving the bacteria in the small intestine. While shown to be effective, elemental diets should only be done under close medical supervision.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space Out Meals and Snacks:&lt;/strong&gt; “Activating the migrating motor complex allows bacteria and food to be swept through the small intestine and is helpful for symptom management and preventing SIBO from recurring once it’s gone,” says Hadley. This cycle can take anywhere from 113 to 230 minutes, so waiting at least four hours between eating can allow the cycle to complete.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow a Short-Term Elimination Diet: &lt;/strong&gt;Another dietary approach is an elimination diet. “Short-term elimination diets, including the low-FODMAP and low-fermentation diet, can significantly reduce bloating, gas and discomfort by limiting the types of carbohydrates that feed bacteria in the gut,” says Hadley. That said, research is limited on whether the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291572/what-to-eat-if-you-have-ibs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;low-FODMAP diet&lt;/a&gt; is effective for SIBO.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Because elimination diets can cause nutrient deficiencies when not done carefully, it’s best to work with a registered dietitian rather than implementing one on your own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; SIBO may start in the small intestine, but its effects don’t stay there. Digestive discomfort, bloating, diarrhea, constipation and gas are common side effects. However, you may also experience more subtle signs of SIBO, including nutritional deficiencies, rosacea, brain fog and fatigue. If you’re concerned that you may have SIBO, talk with your doctor about testing and treatment options to manage and resolve SIBO and its effects. After all, as Nahar says, “Early identification and a comprehensive approach can make a significant difference in symptom relief and quality of life."&lt;br&gt;

Focusing on healthy behaviors and things we already love to do can help boost dopamine, the neurotransmitter involved in the pleasure and rewards system in our brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From an evolutionary standpoint, dopamine rewards us when we do things we need to survive, leading you to want to do these activities more. “Dopamine benefits us because it rewards essential behaviors such as eating when hungry, drinking when thirsty or reproduction,” says &lt;a href="https://patientcare.rutgershealth.org/provider/emily-gordon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Emily Gordon, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Emily Gordon, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor of medicine at &lt;a href="https://njms.rutgers.edu" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rutgers New Jersey Medical School;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rutgers New Jersey Medical School&lt;/a&gt; and director of the &lt;a href="https://njms.rutgers.edu/departments/psychiatry/addiction_medicine_fellowship.php" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Addiction Medicine Fellowship Program;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Addiction Medicine Fellowship Program&lt;/a&gt;. “It gives you a sense of accomplishment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is dopamine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain has billions of neurons that transfer messages from one nerve cell to the next, directing all of our movements and emotions. “Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, or chemical in the brain, that is sometimes referred to as the ‘feel good neurotransmitter’ because it’s integral to the brain’s reward system, pleasure and motivation,” says &lt;a href="https://markey.camden.rutgers.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Charlotte Markey, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Charlotte Markey, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, professor of psychology at &lt;a href="https://psychology.camden.rutgers.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rutgers University;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rutgers University&lt;/a&gt; and author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Adultish-Body-Image-Book-Life-ebook/dp/B0CW1F16P5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Body Image Book;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Body Image Book&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series. “Dopamine also affects mood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it's natural to experience lower dopamine levels at times. “There are definitely ways you may run low on dopamine, such as when estrogen is on a downward slope when the menstrual cycle nears or during menopause,” says &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/wilfahrt-robert-p-m-d/bio-20208651" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bob Wilfahrt, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Bob Wilfahrt, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a family doctor who specializes in ADHD at &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Other times you might just be in a lousy mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our body has evolved to do what we think is useful for survival,” explains Dr. Wilfahrt. For instance, because there was a time when loading up on carbohydrate-rich foods was helpful to avoid perishing in a famine, it makes sense that we might reach for a donut when we want to feel better today. Sometimes a donut is exactly what you need, “but there are &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/g64328042/mood-boosting-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy ways to get a dopamine boost;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthy ways to get a dopamine boost&lt;/a&gt;,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What activities boost dopamine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no one-size-fits all for what can make you feel good. “Different people have variations in dopamine metabolism, which is why some people get a ‘runner’s high,’” says Dr. Gordon. “The activities you enjoy and that give you a sense of accomplishment are individualized.” Try a few of these healthy, science-backed methods for boosting dopamine and see what makes you feel great:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Move your body.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8301978/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A large body of research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;A large body of research&lt;/a&gt; has found that exercise increases dopamine signaling. While there’s no specific recommendation or ideal “prescription” for how much you need,&lt;strong&gt; aim for 150 minutes of cardiovascular exercise every week,&lt;/strong&gt; says Dr. Gordon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do:&lt;/strong&gt; Choose an activity you love so you’ll actually stick with it. That may be playing pickleball, chasing the kids around the local children's gym or walking briskly at lunchtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/fitness/a64177188/i-tried-rucking-weighted-vest/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I Tried This Viral Walking Hack for Weeks — Here's Why I Think Everyone Should Do It;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;I Tried This Viral Walking Hack for Weeks — Here's Why I Think Everyone Should Do It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Halfpoint - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Listen to music.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10765015/#:~:text=The%20study%20registered%20a%20release%20of%20dopamine,one's%20preferred%20song%20(Salimpoor%20et%20al.%2C%202011).&amp;amp;text=In%20contrast%2C%20listening%20to%20unpleasant%20music%20correlated,increased%20release%20of%20serotonin%20upon%20unpleasant%20music." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has found that hearing music &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1811878116" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stimulates dopamine release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;stimulates dopamine release&lt;/a&gt; and engages a network of brain circuits, including cognitive, memory and emotional components, says Dr. Gordon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do:&lt;/strong&gt; Listen to what you love, but experiment with new music, too —maybe what your kids are into? — because &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article-abstract/34/4/bhae177/7658637?login=false" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies show;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt; it can challenge your brain in a way old music doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;RunPhoto - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Meditate.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is also released during meditation, says Dr. Gordon. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10355843/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has found that meditation can influence positive brain changes and improved brain functions, including emotions that help address anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do:&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re new to the practice, check out simple meditation activities through sites like &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/uclamindful/health-and-wellness-meditations" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UCLA Mindful;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UCLA Mindful&lt;/a&gt; for free guided meditations or download &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/wellness/g31945544/best-meditation-apps/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a meditation app;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a meditation app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Mavocado - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Try something new.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ignite your reward system by trying something new.

Basically, you step away from a chore to stimulate dopamine by doing a pleasurable activity that gives you a sense of reward so you can go back to the task a little refreshed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do:&lt;/strong&gt; Make a list or “dopamine menu” of activities you enjoy. Choose activities that allow a quick break, but that won’t take up the whole afternoon, says Dr. Wilfahrt. Your list can include anything you love — petting your cat, calling a friend, stepping outside or munching on a handful of veggies or fruits.

Here’s what two top doctors and a dietitian want you to know about the sweetener and the potential risks it poses to your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: Scott Keatley, RD, co-owner of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/christopher-e-yi" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Christopher Yi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Christopher Yi&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a vascular surgeon at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA; Auburn Berry, lead study author and a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder; &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cheng-Han Chen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers treated cells from the tiny blood vessels in the brain (known as cerebral microvascular endothelial cells) with erythritol. They discovered that cells that were exposed to the amount of sweetener in one drink serving had higher levels of oxidative stress. (In case you’re not familiar with it, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/oxidative-stress" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:oxidative stress;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; is an imbalance in the body that can damage cells, lead to aging, and raise the risk of cancer and other diseases.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also discovered that cells exposed to erythritol produced less nitric oxide, which is a compound that helps blood vessels dilate. Lower levels of nitric oxide can mess with blood flow, make it hard for blood vessels to widen, and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We decided to study erythritol because it is widely marketed and consumed as a ‘safe’ sugar alternative,” says Auburn Berry, lead study author and a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder. “However, emerging evidence has linked erythritol intake to an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, particularly ischemic stroke. Despite these associations, the direct biological effects of erythritol on brain endothelial cell function, which is critical for maintaining cerebrovascular health, are poorly understood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is erythritol?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol is a low-calorie sugar substitute, explains Scott Keatley, RD, co-owner of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s popular because it doesn’t impact blood glucose and levels of insulin (a hormone that helps escort glucose to your cells to be used for energy) as much as table sugar does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's often marketed as a ‘natural’ sugar substitute due to its lower glycemic index and minimal calorie content,” Keatley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it's widely considered safe in moderation, Keatley says that there's a growing body of research suggesting that it may not be entirely without risk, especially when consumed in larger quantities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What foods contain erythritol?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol is found in a lot of sugar-free products, like energy drinks, some snack foods, and protein bars. It’s also used as a sweetener in &lt;a href="https://halotop.com/pints/chocolate" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Halo Top ice cream;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Halo Top ice cream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.questnutrition.com%2Fproducts%2Fchocolate-chip-cookie-dough-protein-bar&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa64589165%2Ferythritol-brain-heart-health-study%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Quest bars;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Quest bars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.coca-cola.com/ca/en/about-us/faq/is-there-sugar-in-vitaminwater-products" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vitaminwater Zero;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Vitaminwater Zero&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s even found in some toothpastes and mouthwashes, says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/christopher-e-yi" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Christopher Yi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Christopher Yi&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a vascular surgeon at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;erythritol interfere with your brain and heart health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol may cause oxidative stress in brain cells by disrupting how they produce energy and “by overwhelming their natural antioxidant defenses,” Dr. Yi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sweetener also seems to lower levels of nitric oxide, which helps protect cells and blood vessels, per Dr. Yi. “This imbalance leads to the buildup of harmful molecules—reactive oxygen species—which can damage cells and contribute to heart and blood vessel problems,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more research is needed to understand why the sweetener causes these changes, says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cheng-Han Chen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it okay to consume erythritol?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol is approved by the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/aspartame-and-other-sweeteners-food#:~:text=The%20FDA%20permits%20the%20use,mannitol%2C%20erythritol%2C%20and%20maltitol." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Food and Drug Administration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; (FDA) as a sweetener and is classified as “generally recognized as safe” or GRAS, meaning it’s considered safe to have in the amounts that are often found in foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Keatley says it’s best to consume it sparingly. “I advise caution, particularly for those at higher risk for cardiovascular conditions,” he says. “Like any sweetener, moderation is key. It’s important to be aware of how much erythritol is consumed, especially considering its potential effects on vascular health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chen also recommends being mindful of how much erythritol you have on a regular basis. “Until we learn more about the negative health effects of erythritol, we should try to understand how much erythritol we are consuming from our food products, and attempt to limit our intake of erythritol as much as possible,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 12:27:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE1VcEN6ZTJrdm9GdnAwSUdpVU80MS15UGpwMjdKX2lIOHVfcl9NYzE5Z24tcWZFX1J1N3NCS3RJOTVLUC12dHVleHJqZHV2ZTJnVGpvWDJCYVNBR1NxeTlZMEwzbHQyUHhfVGsyX2VYaHdGM005RWJTakU0YUxHZw</guid></item><item><title>追溯听觉的起源-神经科学新闻 | Tracing the Origins of Hearing - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE1XcTA4NEgxbmROU055dzJXTF9GTTQ0WEpFUFUzV0lTMG1xU2NmRWdlaHFZVlRuZlRoRnN5eGdlcmdQUkJsOXhVdHZmbHNaNG1VcDVyTmxoVWg4Tll3NEZLZWVnTkU5NkxMRW1v?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have developed a genetic “barcoding” method to trace how stem cells in embryos become neurons and inner ear cells. By labeling early stem cells in mice, the team followed their development and mapped the formation of the inner ear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that hearing-critical cells arise from two main types of stem cells, offering clues for future hearing loss therapies. This approach provides a detailed “family tree” of nervous system development and could eventually reduce the need for animal testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Barcoding:&lt;/strong&gt; A virus-based barcode allowed researchers to trace stem cell development into neurons and inner ear cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hearing Insights:&lt;/strong&gt; Two main stem cell types give rise to critical inner ear structures involved in hearing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Applications:&lt;/strong&gt; The method could aid treatments for hearing loss and help study other parts of the nervous system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Karolinska Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at Karolinska Institutet have developed a method that shows how the nervous system and sensory organs are formed in an embryo. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By labelling stem cells with a genetic ‘barcode’, they have been able to follow the cells’ developmental journey and discover how the inner ear is formed in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery, published in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, could provide important insights for future treatment of hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109211"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/genetics-hearing-development-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/genetics-hearing-development-neuroscience-300x178.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/genetics-hearing-development-neuroscience-770x456.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/genetics-hearing-development-neuroscience-293x174.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/genetics-hearing-development-neuroscience-150x89.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/genetics-hearing-development-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows cells in the inner ear." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/genetics-hearing-development-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/genetics-hearing-development-neuroscience-300x178.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/genetics-hearing-development-neuroscience-770x456.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/genetics-hearing-development-neuroscience-293x174.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/genetics-hearing-development-neuroscience-150x89.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Image of the inner ear.

The virus contained a genetic ‘barcode’ that was integrated into the DNA of the stem cells and then inherited as the cells divided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By following this code, the researchers could track how the cells developed into different types of neurons and cells in the inner ear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that cells in the inner ear, which are crucial for hearing, develop from two main types of stem cells. This knowledge could lead to new treatments for hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Tracing the origin and development of cells gives us a unique opportunity to understand the basic mechanisms behind hearing loss,” says Emma Andersson. “It can help us find new ways to repair or replace damaged cells in the inner ear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring the nervous system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team now plans to use the method to study other parts of the nervous system, but also how the rest of the body develops. They hope their work will lead to new insights and treatments for various genetic and developmental diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are only at the beginning of understanding the complex processes behind nervous system development,” says Emma Andersson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our method opens up many exciting opportunities to explore how the nervous system and the rest of the body are formed during embryonic development. In addition, the technique can reduce the number of mice used in research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She led the study with Jingyan He, a postdoctoral fellow, and Sandra de Haan, a former PhD student in Emma Andersson’s research group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was funded by Karolinska Institutet, the European Union, the Erling-Persson Foundation, the Swedish Research Council, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, the Hearing Research Fund, Horizon Europe and Wallenberg Bioinformatics Support.

So are limiting screen time, being creative and reading, and having friends and social connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know which one is the most important,” Rao said. “But in aggregate fashion, diet, sleep, making sure they’re actively engaged with other individuals and things that make them curious to learn more, those are extremely important as the brain is growing and developing.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Teenage years&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people, the teenage years are when depression and other mental health conditions can become more prominent, with more recognizable symptoms, Rao said. Some mental health disorders can mimic dementia and cognitive issues. And pressure from academics or sports may trigger stress and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you can mitigate some of those things as early as possible with recognition, getting help, avoiding inactivity, avoiding substances of abuse like tobacco, alcohol and nicotine, and encouraging teenagers to get out and minimize screen time, continue to learn and engage with their education, those are things we’d recommend,” Rao said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies have shown that people with higher levels of formal education may be less likely to develop dementia later in life. It’s not clear exactly why, but it could be that progressing in education “pushes” your brain and helps build a buffer or cognitive reserve that can protect against — or delay — changes in your brain that manifest as dementia years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Higher education has been linked to the idea of ‘cognitive resilience,’ making it likely to keep promoting brain health from a young age throughout our lifetime,” Sha said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Young adulthood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain development starts to slow down as we transition from the teenage years into the 20s, Rao said, but the 20s are a time when many young adults engage in risky behavior. So it’s important to try to minimize the risk of head injury by wearing a helmet, for instance, when skiing, biking and playing football. Head trauma, especially repeated trauma, raises the risk of brain damage and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And start to develop good habits regarding diet and sleep if they haven’t already,” Rao said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may be more feasible once you’re out of college and have a more regular work and sleep schedule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After 20, 25-ish, I look at it as holding on to what you have because the amount of brain development thereafter is pretty minimal,” Rao said. “It’s really about maintenance and … keeping it active as much as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="S300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Midlife&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you enter your 30s, Rao recommends seeing your doctor regularly if you’re not already. Start monitoring your blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is to try to reduce your risk of vascular dementia, the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer’s. Vascular dementia is caused not just by acute events like a stroke, which disrupts blood flow to the brain, but also by chronic, progressive small blockages in the smallest blood vessels in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;High cholesterol, diabetes and high blood pressure (hypertension) can slowly damage these blood vessels over time, especially if the conditions are not well controlled and occur over years or decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our vascular health is hugely important to our brain health,” Kotwal said. “As those build up over time, that can cause dementia. So, anything we can do to preserve our cardiovascular health, particularly our vascular health, that can help to reduce our dementia risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Alzheimer’s, which is related to age, genetics and other factors that aren’t totally well understood, vascular dementia “is fairly preventable by being aggressive with risk factor modification,” Rao said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some clinical trials have found that managing blood pressure and cholesterol not only helps people live longer, but also helps preserve people’s cognition longer, Kotwal said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep, hobbies, social connection and moderating alcohol consumption are also important, experts say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people in their 30s start having children and may not be sleeping well, or are more stressed at work — which can potentially inhibit good brain health, Rao said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have to make sure you save time for yourself,” he said. “That could be reading a book, taking a class, going on a run regularly. Whatever is your thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that getting consistent sleep may feel unrealistic with young children, but urges people to try to keep up their hobbies and friendships, as this will help set the tone for the next few decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That will build your habits for your 40s, 50s and 60s,” Rao said. “You’ll keep going with them, which is extremely important in the subsequent decades.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While diet is important at every age, it’s often in the 40s and 50s that many people start to pay more attention to it because midlife is when high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes become more common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As you enter your 50s, it’s even more important to stay active,” Rao said. “It’s even more important to focus on your medical issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies show the MIND diet — which combines the Mediterranean diet and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, emphasizing leafy greens, berries, legumes, fish and chicken while minimizing alcohol, cheese and fried foods — may slow cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The thing I like about the MIND diet is it’s more practical than going vegan, which is hard for people to do and stick with,” Rao said. “The most important thing is compliance with what you can do, and eventually slowly moving toward the MIND diet. Don’t take it all on at once. Some progress is better than giving up completely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If people are interested in the MIND diet, Rao said, it has “low downside and potentially upside not just on cognitive health but for hypertension, diabetes, controlling cholesterol and mood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Later life/seniors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s common for patients in their 70s and 80s to be isolated, lonely and extremely introverted, Rao said. Researchers aren’t sure whether cognitive decline causes people to become less social and thus more lonely and isolated, or whether being less social and more isolated causes or worsens cognitive decline; it could be that both are true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The 60s and beyond, it starts to change more toward some of the softer things, such as staying connected, really focusing on who’s your friend network, how do you engage with them,” Rao said. “How do you keep active with those connections, whether it’s an adult senior center or golf course or playing mahjong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Keep learning. Have a reason or purpose to get out of bed. Try to walk a little more than you did yesterday,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rao also emphasized it’s important at this age to be careful about falls, which can precipitate a brain bleed or broken hip and accelerate a downward spiral in cognitive and overall health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid- and late life, people who are socially active tend to have better cognitive outcomes, said UCSF’s Kotwal. Perhaps hearteningly, that’s one risk factor that people have more control over, compared to other risk factors like exposure to environmental toxins such as pollution and microplastics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Socializing “puts a lot of demand on our brains,” he said. “It requires coordination, engagement at an in-depth level. Sometimes you’re required to bridge multiple different social connections if you’re at a party and introducing people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s the ‘use it or lose it’ theory,” he said. “You have to use these skills. Staying socially engaged will help you maintain executive function, language abilities and memory to engage with people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being socially active also means you’re more likely to engage in physical activities that are good for your health, like hiking with a friend or going to a group exercise class, which has dual benefits — you can work out and socialize with friends.       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people don’t do these things, they can accumulate risk factors or disadvantages over time, Kotwal said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply engaging in activities you enjoy can help your brain stay active, even if you’re not consciously “using” your brain like you would with crossword puzzles or Sudoku. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you enjoy things, it reduces stress, and that reduces overall inflammation in your body and reduces the impact that general wear and tear that inflammation can take on our bodies over the years,” Kotwal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>San Francisco Chronicle</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 11:00:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNXzJwcVVkRDBrWGlVUjNISlU5TG81Z2U5Mm1EZ3lPc0ZsR1pLSVgtUVV5aWVBSXNBekVFdDhMMFJkdEd6ek1ZdlFOYlptbDJaZTBFYlJQY2YyWjZxbWkxNE9SS3E1NzAwdWhHaHRRd090WV9FVGpHalhyR19PREZLOE1XejdrbjZEakpOTHpnRnZ6bHZsTEE</guid></item><item><title>专家最担心的4种营养素短缺- HuffPost | The 4 Shortfall Nutrients Experts Worry Most About - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re eating the way most people in America do these days, you’re probably falling short of the vital nutrients you need.

One of the reasons it’s important to get enough of this nutrient, she said, is because potassium plays an important role in regulating blood pressure. “But the foods richest in potassium — fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and legumes — aren’t eaten enough as part of the standard American diet,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One reason for this imbalance, said registered dietician nutritionist &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corymygrant/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Cory Mygrant" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a68f8e4b0d1cc4a5a853c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corymygrant/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="16"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cory Mygrant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, is the high sodium content in our diets. “Many people consume too much sodium, often due to processed foods, and so they aren’t getting enough potassium to balance it out. Potassium is a crucial nutrient that works alongside sodium to help maintain the right balance of fluids and electrolytes in your body. This imbalance can lead to high blood pressure, which is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two top sources of potassium, potatoes and bananas, have been “demonized” in some circles, Hernandez said, but they’re great sources of a vital nutrient: “A medium baked potato has 164 calories and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170030/nutrients" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="952 milligrams of potassium" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a68f8e4b0d1cc4a5a853c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170030/nutrients" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="17"&gt;&lt;span&gt;952 milligrams of potassium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and a medium banana has just 105 calories, but &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/173944/nutrients" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="422 milligrams of potassium" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a68f8e4b0d1cc4a5a853c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/173944/nutrients" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="18"&gt;&lt;span&gt;422 milligrams of potassium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole Foods, Not Pills, Will Make A Difference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All this talk of shortfalls might leave you wondering if it’s at all possible to keep yourself well nourished these days.

It’s how the fat and fiber in the avocado slow down your gastric emptying and help keep you fuller longer. It’s also about how satisfying it tastes.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Staying well-nourished is much simpler than you might think, Walker said. “We don’t need extreme diets or supplements to fill these nutrient gaps, but simple, intentional dietary shifts that can make a significant impact. By increasing whole foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, dairy and lean proteins, you can improve your intake of these critical shortfall nutrients, leading to better long-term health and disease prevention.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 11:00:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxPZmV4Q0pFUndwOVlicktYeEdRQ0FuXzE2b2ozc1k4M19pSUY5R1FKOEFISG84XzdLNGZxOFlKRk1ZcjBqRXd2Z3Q3OXdXVVhwUWkyRWhFUmE2UzZoQTI0ZmgxTFFhYlJ2TGJSWU1UWEdiOVdGc1FkeG1zNlhyYVZuTl9rN3B4aWRXSmRXQWhDQktfMV9GMWpGZ1NaUThvLXdFZjV5WXBTLVR5NGxqbENSX2xMZ9IBuAFBVV95cUxPQ0NiYzNXTlh5LVB5dTJWSUxqY3pDNi00WGpmODVEc1c3S3hmVFJMVmtOTVV1YzFzVXh2eHp1ZUFZYXVSeDRvSWFkVkhRaktveXRSeFB5M0RGZnVvdzhkZ3JQVThZQ0xXbmc4TEY3R2dGbVMzcWVsVlZ5T3lBaHRjaDNma0pBZmZnY3RXRTJURU9OM3FLdGFLa1lBRHRWb0hZZ2daZlVlWjVtWEFBRXZrTmF6Uk9ROE1l</guid></item><item><title>医生希望你停止食用人造糖-一项新的研究显示了确切的原因-女性健康 | Doctors Want You To Stop Consuming Artificial Sugar—A New Study Shows Exactly Why - Women's Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxOdldjTFotVjF2OHhoeXl1a09kSGlwYUNGSUF6ZHhKZm9XbEp0RmxpVkIwM3JLbVd6WmZiWW51WENSV292bGM5WFU5emMzdmp4djNQSFkwT1RwOTFTbUVKR1hQOXlYUVNUcFdvNFZkQklucDBzdm4tNFlldFU5RERaR2U2N2VJbEQyRVZyRE93?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-j4k1z9 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;If a sugar-free soda or &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/g38820715/low-calorie-food/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/g38820715/low-calorie-food/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="low-calorie" data-node-id="0.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;low-calorie&lt;/a&gt; candy bar seem too good to be true, that's because sometimes, they are.

They discovered that cells that were exposed to the amount of sweetener in one drink serving had higher levels of oxidative stress. (In case you’re not familiar with it, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/oxidative-stress" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/oxidative-stress" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="oxidative stress" data-node-id="6.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; is an imbalance in the body that can damage cells, lead to aging, and raise the risk of cancer and other diseases.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The researchers also discovered that cells exposed to erythritol produced less nitric oxide, which is a compound that helps blood vessels dilate. Lower levels of nitric oxide can mess with blood flow, make it hard for blood vessels to widen, and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“We decided to study erythritol because it is widely marketed and consumed as a ‘safe’ sugar alternative,” says Auburn Berry, lead study author and a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder. “However, emerging evidence has linked erythritol intake to an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, particularly ischemic stroke. Despite these associations, the direct biological effects of erythritol on brain endothelial cell function, which is critical for maintaining cerebrovascular health, are poorly understood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-erythritol" data-node-id="10" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="10.0"&gt;What is erythritol?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Erythritol is a low-calorie sugar substitute, explains Scott Keatley, RD, co-owner of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://keatleymnt.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s popular because it doesn’t impact blood glucose and levels of insulin (a hormone that helps escort glucose to your cells to be used for energy) as much as table sugar does. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“It's often marketed as a ‘natural’ sugar substitute due to its lower glycemic index and minimal calorie content,” Keatley says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;While it's widely considered safe in moderation, Keatley says that there's a growing body of research suggesting that it may not be entirely without risk, especially when consumed in larger quantities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-foods-contain-erythritol" data-node-id="15" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;What foods contain erythritol?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Erythritol is found in a lot of sugar-free products, like energy drinks, some snack foods, and protein bars.

Not only does it keep us physically fit, but it can also have significant effects on our mental wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientist Dr Robert Love has revealed that incorporating a common &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/lifestyle/food-drink"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; into your daily meals could potentially lower the risk of &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/latest/alzheimers-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;. In a recent video, he discussed why current research suggests this simple dietary change could be beneficial for your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He referenced a study conducted by Dr Lei Feng and his team, which found that individuals who consume mushrooms at least three times a week experienced a "significant reduction" in their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The study even suggested that this habit could decrease the risk by as much as 40%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Love explained: "That is huge. Now, people are asking 'what kind of mushrooms?' Now the research did not specify, so that means pretty much most mushrooms. If not, all edible mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ovp-primis"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mce-linkchecker-status="valid"&gt;"Edible mushrooms are great for your brain. My favorite edible mushroom for the brain is something called lion's mane. Lion's mane is a mushroom that's great for memory, it reduces stress and anxiety, it improves mood, it's good for your gut bacteria and it even helps improve sleep."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Love emphasized that all types of mushrooms are beneficial for brain health, and he recommended a few others as well. While he admitted that white mushrooms are the "least beneficial", he still encourages everyone to incorporate this food into their diet as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there's no foolproof diet against Alzheimer's, a study suggests that mushrooms could play a role in risk reduction. A 2019 study by experts at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the National University of Singapore (NUS) found that elderly people consuming upwards of two standard portions of mushrooms weekly may cut their chances of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For clarity, a single portion amounts to about three-quarters of a cup of cooked mushrooms, averaging 150 grams. Roughly, this equates to half a plate for two portions. Standards aside, the research hinted that even a modest amount of mushrooms each week might significantly lower MCI risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor Lei Feng, from the NUS Department of Psychological Medicine, &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.j-alz.com/content/nus-study-eating-mushrooms-may-reduce-risk-cognitive-decline" rel="nofollow"&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt;: "This correlation is surprising and encouraging. It seems that a commonly available single ingredient could have a dramatic effect on cognitive decline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What you need to know about Alzheimer's disease&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the NHS in the UK: "Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the UK. Dementia is the name for a group of symptoms associated with an ongoing decline of brain functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It can affect memory, thinking skills and other mental abilities. The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not yet fully understood, although a number of things are thought to increase your risk of developing the condition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk factors include increasing age, a family history of the condition, untreated depression, lifestyle factors and conditions associated with cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease. It's a progressive condition, which means the symptoms develop gradually over time and become worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually the first signs include minor memory problems such as forgetting about recent conversations or events, or forgetting the names of places and objects. If you are concerned you, or a loved one, may have the illlness it's important to contact your GP for advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express US</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 08:55:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQcXdEMWw1WWNsN3dpZGEzaUxVNjktc0pla3o4dTA0OUxDRnJaOTRvblIyRm9kYWFQc2F2cXV6MEpaaGstdmJtZGt2WlZ5MUs2UmgyaWt5bE83R2hPWklMQ2RSSEFidWpEcEpvOEJ6XzF5WWVtVFZ2eE40a0FWQzQwanBuLUJkUzBobnRNVk01cE5FRktLM21nX9IBngFBVV95cUxNVTRZLVF2dHJsNTNfcnpGRUtqTksxWjhpcDBSOTcyT3AtNzduek5UN2JLNElMWlhwTnBqVDFSa2ctcXNPMm1wanVJTERFMTZKdUdmRlpNeWsxcVdLTUNjMGg0X0xQanJvNnY5cHZEdGVkci1IYW8wYVJpUlRQTUNCTFo1RkVGUXNEemZHQUpOcEx0dzA4bWFrYThBeTVIdw</guid></item><item><title>我开车去上大学，由于数百万人鲜为人知的状况，突然失明了10年-每日邮报 | I was driving to college and suddenly went BLIND for 10 years due to little-known condition millions have - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxNM0p4d1VlN0VTVTAxUVNHZlRkdjVrcHo3OFRPVGVUbVF0dElSX0RINlo1OWh0OXF4czBFTXpCdE9GTlR6Z3ItaVlwdEpVRllSZFhod1NxLUNKbHRiRW00VlNabWVaemNQeHlfZ0E5TWZKVl8zdjBSX1BnVi1jMUJSQUJYTUY5aUU3bUVFamkzOTZqTnU4MnfSAZsBQVVfeXFMT0tDdFgwTng0UjYtRXg4dlREbDA1aWQ3UkhsS2hVTmtsMVdHLTZRa2hfRi1CWjJFVFRHQmRPRnIzN29GeWhSM3ItZDZXcXlmaHB4NkcyMnNaQ2lwcXRJajN1aTZWek9JRHdZaDhkRFVwSEJiYXZZb2NSa2ZNdmJGWm8zdHdKNWoxVElESEltU2QxcDVvRDJkejRTWG8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sierra Domb was driving to college when suddenly her vision completely blacked out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She managed to swerve off the road and park despite physically shaking with fear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A few minutes later her &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14622833/experts-reveal-eye-mucus-bacteria-sleep-wake-up.html"&gt;eyesight gradually returned &lt;/a&gt;— but it has never been the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That moment, back in 2015, marked the beginning of her battle with an extremely rare neurological condition known as visual snow syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is often described by people as seeing flickering, tiny dots or 'snow' &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14555215/PROF-ROB-GALLOWAY-children-BLINDNESS-screens-myopia-treatment.html"&gt;across their entire field of vision.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shockingly, doctors say about 2 to 3 percent of people have it to varying degrees but it's challenging to get a precise number of officially diagnosed cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For most sufferers it's something they live with but, because of the lack of scientific research, it can be very difficult to get a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A decade on from her initial blackout, Domb, now 30, says it has left her feeling like she's 'seeing through a TV with a very bad reception'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She likens it to a snow globe that's been shaken up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sierra Domb was driving to college when suddenly her vision completely blacked out. That moment, back in 2015, marked the beginning of her battle with an extremely rare neurological condition known as visual snow syndrome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also has to contend with double vision, extreme sensitivity to light, ringing in her ears, and constant headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her symptoms became so debilitating that she could no longer drive and had to take an extended leave of absence from college. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because visual snow syndrome is so rare and difficult to diagnose, it took years before Domb finally understood what was happening to her body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, she's leading the charge to raise awareness for the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For years, I struggled to find answers, only to be misdiagnosed and constantly dismissed by medical professionals who claimed my symptoms "didn't exist" or told me I was "too young" to have serious health problems,' Domb told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Soon, even familiar faces and beautiful landscapes transformed into disorienting, nightmarish experiences.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Cleveland Clinic notes that visual snow syndrome is a relatively new diagnosis — the term was only coined in 2013 — and researchers still don't fully understand what causes it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some scientists believe it may be the result of overactivity in the parts of the brain responsible for processing images. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, experts have found the syndrome in people who also suffer from anxiety or migraines — conditions often preceded by 'auras,' or sensory disturbances that can include ringing in the ears, flashing lights, or even speech and language problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Auras associated with anxiety are often linked to heightened sensitivity and hyperstimulation, which can trigger visual or sensory distortions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Domb was desperately hunting for a diagnosis, she was prescribed medications that actually made her symptoms worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The doctors who took me seriously warned that I was likely going blind, but they couldn't confirm when or if it would happen, as my medical tests on my eyes consistently came back "normal",' she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is because visual snow syndrome is a neurological condition so standard eye tests will not work.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure for visual snow syndrome but, along with medication, treatment options include therapy to help reduce stress and specialized lenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The popular notion that my twenties would be the best years of my life quickly turned into a nightmarish medical odyssey I wouldn't wish on anyone,' Domb said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Because visual snow syndrome is so rare and difficult to diagnose, it took years before Domb finally understood what was happening to her body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After realizing she was suffering from visual snow syndrome, Domb founded the Visual Snow Initiative to raise awareness and support others who were 'suffering in silence.' She now travels the world talking about the condition and helping others &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was devastating to feel invisible and alone in my struggle.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite everything, Domb threw herself into research and eventually discovered that others were suffering from the same mysterious symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said realizing she wasn't alone was 'both comforting and heartbreaking.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Many shared their pain and frustration, and some, feeling desperate and without the resources or support they needed, even suggested suicide as a way out,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After realizing she was suffering from visual snow syndrome, Domb founded the Visual Snow Initiative to raise awareness and support others who were 'suffering in silence.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since she launched the organization in 2018 — three years after her symptoms first appeared — it has heard from patients in 93 countries and amassed more than 60,000 followers across social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Touching on some of the groundbreaking discoveries she's helped support, Domb says, 'Some individuals are born with symptoms, while others, like me, experience onset of the condition at any point in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Clinical cases show that people as young as 8 years old have developed visual snow syndrome, though onset most commonly occurs during the teenage or young adult years.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thanks to her efforts, the condition has now been recognized by the World Health Organization and included in its annual International Classification of Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to raising awareness, Domb's organization is helping to fund research into treatment and management options for the little-known condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The health advocate and entrepreneur concludes, 'I wasn't and am not a doctor – just a patient who had been disregarded, but I refused to let that silence me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My mission was never about proving others wrong, but about giving a voice to those who were overlooked, so no one would have to endure the medical odyssey that I did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Recognition from the WHO is historic and lives forever.

That moment, back in 2015, marked the beginning of her battle with an extremely rare neurological condition known as visual snow syndrome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also has to contend with double vision, extreme sensitivity to light, ringing in her ears, and constant headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her symptoms became so debilitating that she could no longer drive and had to take an extended leave of absence from college. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because visual snow syndrome is so rare and difficult to diagnose, it took years before Domb finally understood what was happening to her body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, she's leading the charge to raise awareness for the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For years, I struggled to find answers, only to be misdiagnosed and constantly dismissed by medical professionals who claimed my symptoms "didn't exist" or told me I was "too young" to have serious health problems,' Domb told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Soon, even familiar faces and beautiful landscapes transformed into disorienting, nightmarish experiences.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Cleveland Clinic notes that visual snow syndrome is a relatively new diagnosis — the term was only coined in 2013 — and researchers still don't fully understand what causes it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some scientists believe it may be the result of overactivity in the parts of the brain responsible for processing images. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, experts have found the syndrome in people who also suffer from anxiety or migraines — conditions often preceded by 'auras,' or sensory disturbances that can include ringing in the ears, flashing lights, or even speech and language problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Auras associated with anxiety are often linked to heightened sensitivity and hyperstimulation, which can trigger visual or sensory distortions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Domb was desperately hunting for a diagnosis, she was prescribed medications that actually made her symptoms worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The doctors who took me seriously warned that I was likely going blind, but they couldn't confirm when or if it would happen, as my medical tests on my eyes consistently came back "normal",' she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is because visual snow syndrome is a neurological condition so standard eye tests will not work.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure for visual snow syndrome but, along with medication, treatment options include therapy to help reduce stress and specialized lenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The popular notion that my twenties would be the best years of my life quickly turned into a nightmarish medical odyssey I wouldn't wish on anyone,' Domb said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Because visual snow syndrome is so rare and difficult to diagnose, it took years before Domb finally understood what was happening to her body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After realizing she was suffering from visual snow syndrome, Domb founded the Visual Snow Initiative to raise awareness and support others who were 'suffering in silence.' She now travels the world talking about the condition and helping others &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was devastating to feel invisible and alone in my struggle.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite everything, Domb threw herself into research and eventually discovered that others were suffering from the same mysterious symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said realizing she wasn't alone was 'both comforting and heartbreaking.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Many shared their pain and frustration, and some, feeling desperate and without the resources or support they needed, even suggested suicide as a way out,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After realizing she was suffering from visual snow syndrome, Domb founded the Visual Snow Initiative to raise awareness and support others who were 'suffering in silence.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since she launched the organization in 2018 — three years after her symptoms first appeared — it has heard from patients in 93 countries and amassed more than 60,000 followers across social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Touching on some of the groundbreaking discoveries she's helped support, Domb says, 'Some individuals are born with symptoms, while others, like me, experience onset of the condition at any point in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Clinical cases show that people as young as 8 years old have developed visual snow syndrome, though onset most commonly occurs during the teenage or young adult years.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thanks to her efforts, the condition has now been recognized by the World Health Organization and included in its annual International Classification of Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to raising awareness, Domb's organization is helping to fund research into treatment and management options for the little-known condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The health advocate and entrepreneur concludes, 'I wasn't and am not a doctor – just a patient who had been disregarded, but I refused to let that silence me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My mission was never about proving others wrong, but about giving a voice to those who were overlooked, so no one would have to endure the medical odyssey that I did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Recognition from the WHO is historic and lives forever. I am deeply grateful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But this is just the beginning. With continued support, I hope Visual Snow Initiative can continue pushing for further advancements in research, treatments, and patient care.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Well, sometimes, your body sends little clues that it’s running low on key nutrients. Our body signals us in various ways about the deficiencies of key nutrients which are essential for several bodily functions. We often overlook the signals until it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, Dr Saurabh Sethi posted on Instagram about the signs that indicate your body needs more nutrients. "Is your body trying to tell you something? In this video, Dr. Sethi breaks down key signs that may indicate you’re not getting enough essential nutrients. From unexpected fatigue to skin issues, discover how these common symptoms could be your body’s way of craving more vitamins and minerals," he has captioned a video giving details of the signs of nutrient deficiency. The five signs, which seem subtle, are brittle nails, twitching in the eyelids, joint clicking, premature graying of hair,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with brittle nails. If your nails are constantly cracking, peeling, or breaking, it’s not just because you washed your hands too much. Brittle nails are one of the earliest signs that your body might be running low on certain key nutrients. Iron is usually the first suspect here. Low iron levels mean your body can’t get enough oxygen to your nail cells, making them weak and flimsy. Biotin, a B-vitamin that often gets a lot of love in beauty supplements, is another major player. Without enough biotin, your nails lose their strength and flexibility. Zinc is also critical because it helps in cell repair and growth. Without sufficient zinc, your nails basically don’t stand a chance at being strong and healthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Have you noticed any changes in your hair color at an early age?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, about that annoying twitching in your eyelid that comes and goes without warning—it’s almost always harmless but super irritating, right? Well, believe it or not, that little muscle spasm could be your body begging for more magnesium. Magnesium plays a huge role in keeping your muscles relaxed and your nerves calm. When your levels dip too low, your nerves can start firing off tiny spasms, especially in delicate muscles like your eyelids. Potassium is another nutrient involved in muscle function, and a deficiency here can add to the twitching drama. Dehydration also worsens things because when your body is low on fluids, your electrolyte balance gets thrown off, making muscle spasms more likely. If you're living on coffee and forgetting water or skimping on magnesium-rich foods like greens and nuts, don't be surprised when your eyelid starts twitching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving on to joint clicking, you know, that sudden pop or crack you hear when you stand up, stretch, or even just move your neck? While a bit of joint noise can be normal, a sudden increase could signal your body is short on a few joint-supporting nutrients. Vitamin D is a big one here. Without enough vitamin D, your bones and joints can lose their strength and cushioning, leading to all sorts of noises and even discomfort. Calcium also plays a starring role in keeping joints smooth and bones strong. A shortage means your bones aren't as sturdy as they should be, and your joints may protest more loudly. Let’s not forget about collagen—nature’s glue that holds your joints, ligaments, and tendons together. As you age or if your diet is low in collagen-boosting nutrients like vitamin C, your joints can become a bit "creaky." So, if your joints have started sounding like an old rocking chair, it might be time to rethink your nutrient intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, there's the heartbreak of spotting gray hairs in your twenties or thirties. Sure, genetics have a lot to do with when you go gray, but if your hair seems to be losing pigment earlier than expected, it could be a sign of a few hidden deficiencies. Vitamin B12 is often the main suspect. It’s essential for healthy blood and nerve cells, and when you don't have enough B12, your hair follicles can suffer, losing the melanin that gives your hair its color. Another player is copper, a mineral that actually helps produce melanin itself. Without enough copper, the pigmentation process stalls, and gray hairs can start creeping in early. Iron deficiency can also mess with the oxygen supply to your hair roots, weakening your strands and robbing them of their vibrant color. So, if you’re finding silver strands in your early 20s, it’s definitely worth checking your B12, copper, and iron levels before blaming it all on "bad genes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re noticing random bruises popping up like little mysteries on your arms and legs, your body might be dropping a big hint. Easy bruising often points to low levels of vitamin C, which your body needs to keep blood vessels strong and healthy. Without enough vitamin C, even a slight bump can cause tiny blood vessels to break. Vitamin K is another important one because it helps your blood clot properly—without it, bruises linger and spread. Sometimes, low iron levels can also make your skin more fragile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your body doesn’t just wake up one morning and decide to act weird. It sends little messages when things aren’t quite right—through your nails, eyes, joints, and hair. Drink your water, get some sunlight, and maybe toss in a supplement if your doctor says it’s okay. It’s amazing how quickly your body can bounce back when you give it the fuel it’s quietly asking for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 03:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-gFBVV95cUxOV2NMZXFpb04xRlhUMVh5ZlZFaXJpZVozSW8zcDRtX21Oc0lrUlYzNW05b3d6d2dxQVBrcVV1UU5UNDBabV80dE9UcV93MEFYY1MzT2pPeDMzOU1qMl83eDA2TUlTM19zektyNkpIQ2pjUmVaT25ELTJUZ25id0hldV9WbTFrTGJlOFQ3QkZ6U3RRQ1AzM2lzWjhuNTBKVGlSS3l3N2RDcjZHRHdPTmduQ2FhTmF2MWJGc0N0UVZxVmpqSU0wd2I0Uk54M0R6bzMzaEdjU01JVTBWMFRKVjR4WUtSNEVlRHBwTXBVbThPdkxpNHFoblVpTk9n0gH_AUFVX3lxTE9mR2h2ZmdLcUVXeURQNU1jZGdiaF9aUGZYX1JUQjJPbGtEdE1JUnI3bF9KdTc0SGRCUGJBcHhmSUpSS3BmcmRJX3lGakpUTmlOU3NJRGR6Rm9xRXk1Q0Y0NUFDSmltVEJtcTNnZ3UtNUtGRGZTQnFUVjlnaWRpTkNyYTNaMDlvZm0zdHQ1MlVTUzY1T09UVzVuaXZkN0JkaGFRY3Q0Y1Zqa1RVTUZJTlN5VUJZbE1VcHJRSnJBTmdDVGF6VXU2MVRJQWFpdk9TWGRnRnZQS2luZ0VvTjNyRy16R3AzOFpYX2ZZTmJlaVp5aHV4THBOc29BbUJZQU9IRQ</guid></item><item><title>抗衰老突破：天然补充剂逆转生物年龄并改善健康- SciTechDaily | Anti-Aging Breakthrough: Natural Supplement Rewinds Biological Age and Improves Health - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxOS0hINEpSUWp4SHVhVkgzT09VWldTYURxNS1iWEZlZ2xKSjRtaUJFOUFxNXNoS3ROcnRDYjlMbHM1QkRHOU9DRDU5NWlrTl94VEk1NTdfM3Z1dnZOenJ2cEN3a0hZMlRpajBEdnd2WGFHeGZCeE1NNGM2aFBTUTNkNG5MdDJxeWQ2NmNxQmtMbzliRlV1STdnUEg0VG0tenFyel81WnJMU09fbmJUeU01Ug?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 03:12:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxOS0hINEpSUWp4SHVhVkgzT09VWldTYURxNS1iWEZlZ2xKSjRtaUJFOUFxNXNoS3ROcnRDYjlMbHM1QkRHOU9DRDU5NWlrTl94VEk1NTdfM3Z1dnZOenJ2cEN3a0hZMlRpajBEdnd2WGFHeGZCeE1NNGM2aFBTUTNkNG5MdDJxeWQ2NmNxQmtMbzliRlV1STdnUEg0VG0tenFyel81WnJMU09fbmJUeU01Ug</guid></item><item><title>家人说， Lake Grove婴儿在拙劣的包皮环切术后为自己的生命而战-新闻12 | Lake Grove infant fighting for his life following botched circumcision, family says - News 12</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxOVllPY3JvbktjbHRDN0R4cmFFWFFBeEEtLVJDLVJHeHBCQjRET3BPa2g3V18xYm5LSzRPN0pFYmN1WmE2SDNOS1ZYWEFCOUh1cUxVeW5UMjE3NXQ4UTdQSk5qcGhqZW1XWnY1TXhEcXVISi1yRG03S3FJam53MjNwdERhS3NtZ0FkN3JXS29vbTdHLUg2dXNlQmQzTDlnN2pqRjNOV3ladE9rWUoyS1BnbDFn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div alignitems="normal" justifycontent="normal" direction="column" gap="1rem,1.25rem" flexwrap="nowrap" class="sc-fsYfdN hQgjIe sc-e6358465-0 dxMubp"&gt;&lt;p class="block"&gt;A newborn baby from Lake Grove is fighting for his life after a circumcision that went wrong, according to the infant's family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Cole Groth nearly bled to death last week in the cardiac neonatal intensive care unit at Columbia Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Depending on who you follow on social media, you may have come across talk of a little-known herb called ashwagandha over the past year. Celebrities including Meghan Markle, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston are &lt;a href="https://uk.style.yahoo.com/anxiety-aid-meghan-markle-jennifer-063000616.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; to use ashwagandha for its calming effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apa.uk.com/herb-of-the-month/ashwagandha"&gt;Ashwagandha&lt;/a&gt; has been trending on social media with &lt;a href="https://opalbond.co.uk/blog/ashwagandha-trends-and-consumer-benefits#:%7E:text=Social%20Media%20Influence,new%20health%20and%20wellness%20trends"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; showing #ashwagandha had more than 670 million views on TikTok in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientifically known as &lt;em&gt;Withania somnifera&lt;/em&gt;, ashwagandha is a common herb used for thousands of years in Ayurvedic medicine – an ancient Indian system of healing based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a balance between the body, mind and spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayurveda emphasises a holistic approach to health using natural treatments, such as herbal remedies, dietary changes, physical therapy, meditation and yoga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But beyond the social media buzz, what does science say about this herb's benefits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashwagandha root has been used in traditional medicine as an &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33103257/"&gt;adaptogen&lt;/a&gt;. This means it could help people become more resilient to various types of stress, whether biological, physical, or chemical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strongest &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210803321000142"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; available for ashwagandha is as a stress and anxiety reliever. A &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210803321000142"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; looking at several small studies showed that ashwagandha can significantly reduce levels of perceived stress and anxiety in people. This may be partly due to its regulating effect on stress hormones such as cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Govl2FUGTUw?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashwagandha is also known for its ability to improve sleep quality. The "somnifera" part of its scientific name, meaning "sleep-inducing" hints at its effects. Some &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Ashwagandha-HealthProfessional/#en2"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; show it can help people fall asleep faster and enjoy deeper, more restful sleep, thus boosting energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be beneficial for people suffering from insomnia. But there is no evidence showing whether it is better than taking sleeping tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Possible benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, this herb has been associated with other benefits. The Sanskrit word "ashwagandha" means "the smell of a horse," symbolising its ability to give the strength and stamina of a horse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Athletes and fitness enthusiasts may benefit from ashwagandha's ability to enhance physical performance. Some &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210803321000142"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; indicates that ashwagandha can improve strength, muscle mass and oxygen use during exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For men, ashwagandha has been shown in some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30466985/"&gt;small studies&lt;/a&gt; to boost testosterone levels and improve fertility by increasing sperm count and motility. This may be linked to dehydroepiandrosterone (&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526128/"&gt;DHEA&lt;/a&gt;) – a sex hormone that your body naturally produces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DHEA is used to make other hormones such as testosterone. This means men with prostate  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="159248" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; sensitive to testosterone should avoid using this herb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_159253" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159253" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/ashwagandha-2-642x428.jpg" alt="Ashwagandha: This Ancient Herb Is Trending For Its Potential Health Benefits – But Also Comes With Risks" class="wp-image-159253 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/ashwagandha-2-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/ashwagandha-2-622x415.jpg 622w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/ashwagandha-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/ashwagandha-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/ashwagandha-2.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-159253" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(eskymaks/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashwagandha has been linked to improved cognitive function, such as better memory and focus. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31742775/"&gt;Small studies&lt;/a&gt;, involving older people who have some cognitive impairment, suggest that ashwagandha may help to reduce &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5551541/"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; – harmful molecules called free radicals that can damage cells in the body – and inflammation, which can negatively effect memory and thinking processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.isrctn.com/editorial/retrieveFile/1d0c866d-98bd-4fd2-937d-a21ca36c4d7a/42176"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; investigating whether ashwagandha may be effective in treating long COVID symptoms such as fatigue and cognitive dysfunction – having trouble with mental tasks such as thinking, remembering and making decisions – but there's no robust evidence yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashwagandha is rich in phytochemicals, including withanolides. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/withanolide"&gt;Withanolides are steroidal lactones&lt;/a&gt; – they are structurally similar to steroids, with a lactone ring in their chemical structure – that are thought to help cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can lower blood sugar in both healthy people and those with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="159248" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, although larger &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31975514/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; need to be done. In &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7696210/"&gt;animal studies&lt;/a&gt;, withanolides show anti-inflammatory activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Side effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ashwagandha may offer potential health benefits, it also has numerous &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Ashwagandha-HealthProfessional/"&gt;risks and side effects&lt;/a&gt;. The long-term safety of ashwagandha is not well-documented. Most studies have focused on short-term use, typically up to three months – but the benefits may take some weeks or months to appear. The most common side effects are mild stomach upsets and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rGVGMQno3QM?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its use is not advised in people with some pre-existing health conditions such as liver disease. Although rare, there have been &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Ashwagandha-HealthProfessional/#en8"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; of liver problems, including severe liver failure, associated with ashwagandha use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashwagandha may &lt;a href="https://www.rheumatologyadvisor.com/features/herbal-supplement-use-in-autoimmune-disease/"&gt;stimulate&lt;/a&gt; the immune system, potentially causing flare ups for people with autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also possible that ashwagandha may interact with some medications, such as immunosuppressants, sedatives and thyroid hormone medications. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25624699/"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that ashwagandha may influence thyroid function, particularly by increasing thyroid hormone levels. It may also interact with thyroid medications, such as levothyroxine, possibly leading to overmedication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pregnant and breastfeeding women are advised to avoid ashwagandha, especially at higher doses. The herb may be linked to miscarriages and, although there's conflicting &lt;a href="https://herbal-ahp.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Press-Release-Ashwagandha-Abortifacient-Assessment_06-24-2024.pdf"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt;, it's best to be cautious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashwagandha holds promise, then, as a stress reliever, sleep aid and even an energy booster. With growing interest and a large body of anecdotal evidence, it's no surprise that it's become a favourite among wellness enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, scientific research is still developing and more extensive  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="159248" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are needed to confirm the benefits, side effects and determine the safest, most effective doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're considering incorporating ashwagandha into your routine, especially for long-term use, do consult a healthcare professional first, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions or are taking other medications.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/253979/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

  "&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As Marmon hinted, crepey skin primarily results from sun exposure. “A frequent misunderstanding is that crepey skin develops solely from aging, but lifestyle factors like sun exposure and smoking are significant contributors,” she said. “While everyone is susceptible to crepey skin, people with lighter skin tones, who are more prone to sun damage, are particularly at risk.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun exposure causes the &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/best-products-for-sagging-skin_l_614b5430e4b0175a1839f2cc" target="_blank"&gt;skin to lose volume&lt;/a&gt; due to dehydration. “It doesn’t store water the same because the integrity of the skin is damaged,” board-certified dermatologist Dr. Shani Francis told HuffPost. That leads to degradation of &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/collagen" target="_blank"&gt;collagen&lt;/a&gt; and elastin, the proteins that hold water and therefore help the skin keep its structure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any ultraviolet exposure, even from tanning beds, can lead to the formation of crepey skin. “It’s really not the sun itself — it’s ultraviolet radiation,” Francis explained. “Any type of ultraviolet radiation exposure is going to damage and degrade the collagen and the elastin tissues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetics play a factor, too. “If you look at your parents, if they have crepey skin, you know you need to start the process of preventing a little bit earlier,” Francis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Marmon, many women begin to notice crepey skin around the time they hit &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/menopause" target="_blank"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt; because the drop in estrogen during that time speeds up the decrease in collagen and elastin, resulting in a thinning of the skin with a loss of moisture and fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It starts around middle age and gets worse as we age,” Francis reiterated. “The elastic fibers, they start off very strong. Twenty-something-, 30-something-year-olds, their skin snaps right back. Once you get to 40, it doesn’t quite work that way.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Board-certified dermatologist &lt;a href="https://www.sherberandrad.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Noëlle S. Sherber&lt;/a&gt; told HuffPost that crepey skin from UV damage usually shows up around the eyes, the chest and the backs of the hands. Some people also see it above the knees and on the inner arms.&lt;/p&gt;

Not so much. The term describes skin that, like crepe paper, appears thin and crinkled and typically lacks the elasticity, thickness, and firmness of youthful skin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Alexandr Zhenzhirov / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Crepey skin is primarily an &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/angelicaamartinez/soul-aesthetic-personality-quiz" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:aesthetic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;aesthetic&lt;/a&gt; concern but it can also be indicative of potential health issues,” board-certified dermatologist Dr. Shoshana Marmon told HuffPost. “Since it usually develops as a result of substantial sun damage, individuals with crepey skin may be at increased risk for the development of skin cancer. Additionally, since crepey skin is thinner and less elastic, it may be more susceptible to bruising and tearing, which could lead to infection if not properly cared for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plenty of creams and lotions claim to alleviate the appearance of crepey skin, and anyone who wants to take care of it quickly can seek doctor-administered treatments.

Sunscreen doesn’t last. It’s not permanent. Sun protection instead of sunscreen is much more comprehensive. I always tell people, think of sunscreen as your last line of defense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For the areas that clothing and accessories can’t cover, apply sunscreen. &lt;a href="https://www.aad.org/public/everyday-care/sun-protection/shade-clothing-sunscreen/is-sunscreen-safe" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The American Academy of Dermatology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The American Academy of Dermatology&lt;/a&gt; recommends a water-resistant one that offers broad-spectrum protection with SPF 30 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some over-the-counter options to try for crepey skin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Anna Frank / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Marmon wants to temper expectations of seeing results from over-the-counter treatments claiming to eliminate the appearance of crepey skin. “While creams, moisturizers, lotions and especially sunscreen are helpful in maintaining skin health, eliminating all &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/anti-aging-skin-care-body_l_62aa46fee4b0cf43c8520b45" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:signs of aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;signs of aging&lt;/a&gt; is pretty much impossible,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, with regular use, topical products with ingredients such as retinoids, alpha hydroxy acids, peptides, growth factors, hyaluronic acid and antioxidants can help to stimulate collagen production, therefore improving skin quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“These products generally take several months before you see their potential benefit,” Sherber warned, adding that a high price tag doesn’t equate to a higher likelihood for results. “A misconception is that only high-end skin care products can combat crepey skin, when in fact, consistent use is far more important than the price tag.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You want to make sure the moisturizer you pick also contains water to rehydrate the skin. “Water is the number one hydrator,” Francis said. “A big mistake people make is coating skin with oil when they’re already dehydrated because all that’s going to do is improve the barrier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Francis particularly loves &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-is-niacinimide_l_60d9d297e4b0b9db24990abe" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:products with niacinamide;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;products with niacinamide&lt;/a&gt;, a form of vitamin B3, as a way to help alleviate the appearance of crepey skin. It can also be taken as a supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sherber offered an easy way to test whether a moisturizer is thick enough to properly hydrate: “When you open the jar and flip it upside down, if it doesn’t drip, then it should be a good barrier support product.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctor-administered treatments to address crepey skin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Klaus Vedfelt / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On May 15, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first skin booster, Skinvive by Juvederm, to improve skin smoothness in adults over 21. The booster is an injectable hyaluronic acid with a serum texture that has been used for years overseas, where they refer to it as Volite. “Unlike fillers, which volumize, skin boosters replenish skin’s deep hydration and can give fantastic results for skin quality improvement, especially in thin-skinned areas that are prone to crepey texture,” Sherber explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other injectables, like Radiesse and Sculptra, stimulate the body to synthesize collagen. Options such as radio frequency skin tightening and fractional non-ablative lasers stimulate the body’s natural healing process, leading to the production of new collagen and elastin that promotes thicker and more elastic skin. “Both can significantly improve skin quality,” Sherber said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For certain anatomical areas, such as around the eyes, she suggested neuromodulators like Botox for reducing crinkling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, “while we can somewhat improve the appearance of crepey skin, the aging process is ongoing and inevitable,” Marmon said. “It is important to have realistic expectations in terms of what to expect from anti-aging products regardless of what they claim to do. Aging is a natural part of life and much better than the alternative.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This article originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/crepey-skin_l_648227d3e4b025003edc406e" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 01:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxPWC1wdmMwU0FtY21fb2tKZllROUVHeWlnQXNuZWF0ZDN4bTBDaHFudG9lMllEQ3g5aXZRTXJSNHpjT1pMbjlpX1hZY2N5akFhM2Rvano1a0p4QWdTUmhxUDZHbUxnN3FWWkFMaVEwYi1UV2lyOC1OTzNLakxMdERPRjZKa2xkQQ</guid></item><item><title>须知：美国有近900例麻疹病例， 10个州正在爆发疫情- KATU | What to know: US has nearly 900 measles cases, and 10 states have active outbreaks - KATU</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With one-fifth of states seeing active measles outbreaks, the U.S. is nearing 900 cases, according to figures posted Friday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC's confirmed measles cases count is 884, triple the amount seen in all of 2024. The vast majority — 646 — are in Texas, where an outbreak in the western part of the state that's approaching the three-month mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two unvaccinated elementary school-aged children died from measles-related illnesses in the epicenter in West Texas, and an adult in New Mexico who was not vaccinated died of a measles-related illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other states with active outbreaks — defined as three or more cases — include Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North America has two other ongoing outbreaks. One in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in 1,020 cases from mid-October through Wednesday. And as of Friday, the Mexican state of Chihuahua state had 605 measles cases, according to data from the state health ministry. The World Health Organization has said cases in Mexico are linked to the Texas outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that’s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines, and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the virus takes hold in other U.S. communities with low vaccination rates, health experts fear the virus that the spread could stretch on for a year. Here's what else you need to know about measles in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many measles cases are there in Texas and New Mexico?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas state health officials said Friday there were 22 new cases of measles since Tuesday, bringing the total to 646 across 26 counties — most of them in West Texas. Hospitalizations were steady Friday at 64 throughout the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials estimated about 1% of cases — fewer than 10 — are actively infectious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty-one percent of Texas' cases are in Gaines County, population 22,892, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has had 393 cases since late January — just over 1.5% of the county's residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The April 3 death in Texas was an 8-year-old child, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Health officials in Texas said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of “what the child's doctor described as measles pulmonary failure.” A unvaccinated child with no underlying conditions died of measles in Texas in late February — Kennedy said age 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Mexico announced one new case Friday, bringing the state’s total to 66. Seven people have been hospitalized since the outbreak started. Most of the state's cases are in Lea County. Three are in Eddy County and Chaves and Doña Ana counties have one each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials say the cases are linked to Texas’ outbreak based on genetic testing. New Mexico reported a measles-related death in an adult on March 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many cases are there in Indiana?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indiana confirmed two more cases Monday in an outbreak that has sickened eight in Allen County in the northeast part of the state — five are unvaccinated minors and three are adults whose vaccination status is unknown. The cases have no known link to other outbreaks, the Allen County Department of Health said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many cases are there in Kansas?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kansas was steady this week with 37 cases in eight counties in the southwest part of the state. Finney, Ford, Grant, Gray and Morton counties have fewer than five cases each. Haskell County has the most with eight cases, Stevens County has seven, Kiowa County has six.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state's first reported case, identified in Stevens County on March 13, is linked to the Texas outbreak based on genetic testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many cases are there in Michigan?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montcalm County, near Grand Rapids in western Michigan, has four linked measles cases. State health officials say the cases are tied to Canada’s large outbreak in Ontario. The state has nine confirmed measles cases as of Friday, but the remaining four are not part of the Montcalm County outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many cases are there in Montana?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montana state health officials announced five cases Thursday in unvaccinated children and adults who had traveled out of state, and confirmed it was an outbreak on Monday. All five are isolating at home in Gallatin County in the southwest part of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are Montana’s first measles cases in 35 years. Health officials didn’t say whether the cases are linked to other outbreaks in North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many cases are there in Ohio?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ohio Department of Health confirmed 32 measles cases in the state Thursday, and one hospitalization. The state count includes only Ohio residents. There are 16 cases in Ashtabula County near Cleveland, 14 in Knox County and one each in Allen and Holmes counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials in Knox County, in east-central Ohio, said there are a total of 20 people with measles, but seven of them do not live in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many cases are there in Oklahoma?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oklahoma was steady Friday with 13 cases: 10 confirmed and three probable. The first two probable cases were “associated” with the West Texas and New Mexico outbreaks, the state health department said. The state health department is not releasing which counties have cases, but Cleveland, Custer and Oklahoma counties have had public exposures in the past couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many cases are there in Pennsylvania?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are eight measles cases in Erie County in far northwest Pennsylvania, officials said Friday. The county declared an outbreak in mid-April. The state said Friday it has 13 cases overall in 2025, including international travel-related cases in Montgomery County and one in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many cases are there in Tennessee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tennessee has six measles cases as of Thursday. Health department spokesman Bill Christian said all cases are the middle part of the state, and that “at least three of these cases are linked to each other” but declined to specify further. The state also did not say whether the cases were linked to other outbreaks or when Tennessee's outbreak started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state health department announced the state's first measles case March 21, three more on April 1 and the last two on April 17, but none of the news releases declared an outbreak. Tennessee is on a list of outbreak states in a Thursday CDC report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where else is measles showing up in the U.S.?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been 884 cases in 2025 as of Friday, according to the CDC. Measles cases also have been reported in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases and outbreaks in the U.S. are frequently traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you need to know about the MMR vaccine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid measles is to get the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting another MMR shot is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don’t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective measles vaccine made from “killed” virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have documentation that they had measles are immune and those born before 1957 generally don’t need the shots because most children back then had measles and now have “presumptive immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called “herd immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots. The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the symptoms of measles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt; dangerous complications&lt;/a&gt; such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can you treat measles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KATU</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 00:51:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>小RFK的愿望成真：每个人都得了麻疹-《每日野兽》 | RFK Jr.’s Wish Is Coming True: Everybody’s Getting Measles - The Daily Beast</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxOeTlRUjloZVpoVTZWZnF0ZC1YUkJwaHRhUkUzNU9MeXBnMUpuZlJRUzJ0M2MzZ1pZcm9xZjdVVEVVbHlHdTR5Z293UnhYNDhTQ3djTXU1NFRqTU0yck02a184eVhhWF9TdGFXRE5lRThncC1OamJGcDlvMFdLbzdGWUNNV1NuNGtBUFcxR1BR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/robert-f-kennedy-jr/"&gt;RFK Jr.&lt;/a&gt;’s vision for America is rapidly becoming reality, with the number of measles cases skyrocketing across the country, bringing the number of confirmed cases to a total of 884.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; published by the CDC on Friday, there have been 884 cases of measles reported across 29 states, including Alaska, California, Hawaii, Illinois, New York and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Just last month, the Health and Human Services Secretary appeared to argue in an interview with Sean Hannity that natural immunity was the best defense against the highly infectious disease. In other words, Kennedy believes that it would be great if everyone got measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“It used to be, when I [was] a kid, that everybody got measles,” he told the Fox News host. “And the measles gave you lifetime protection against measles infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He continued, “The vaccine doesn’t do that. The vaccine is effective for some people for life, but for many people it wanes.” He went on to argue against the MMR vaccine, telling Hannity that the government shouldn’t force people to get the vaccine, because “There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year. It causes all the illnesses that measles itself cause, like encephalitis and blindness, etc., so people ought to be able to make that choice for themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In 2025 alone, measles cases have been reported in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;At least six of those states—Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio and Texas—have reported outbreaks, meaning three or more related cases. Texas, the epicenter of the outbreak, has seen 646 cases since late January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;There have been three confirmed deaths, two of whom were children: 8-year-old Daisy Hildebrand and 6-year-old Kayley Fehr. Those mark the first deaths from measles in the U.S. in more than a decade. The majority of cases have occurred in individuals under the age of 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Stanford University researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/24/measles-cases-deaths-vaccine-rates-rfk-jr/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/24/measles-cases-deaths-vaccine-rates-rfk-jr/"&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; that if vaccination rates remain steady, measles could become entrenched, resulting in hundreds of thousands of cases “where deaths are commonplace and hospitalizations are happening all the time,” according to Nathan Lo, a Stanford University physician and author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Only two percent of the 884 people infected in 2025 have received the recommended dose of the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Daily Beast</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 00:11:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOeTlRUjloZVpoVTZWZnF0ZC1YUkJwaHRhUkUzNU9MeXBnMUpuZlJRUzJ0M2MzZ1pZcm9xZjdVVEVVbHlHdTR5Z293UnhYNDhTQ3djTXU1NFRqTU0yck02a184eVhhWF9TdGFXRE5lRThncC1OamJGcDlvMFdLbzdGWUNNV1NuNGtBUFcxR1BR</guid></item><item><title>美国最有可能患上最致命癌症的国家……您的排名在哪里？ --《每日邮报》 | States most at risk of America's deadliest cancer... where does YOURS rank? - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOSHFSZkU0eTh1dUQxLVY0U1l3a3g1OU5FYjUxSjBRM1psaUZoSGpRNDg2MVQxTjY2UlZYMTRxUC1HbDNOMWVCc1RRNjBJWEszYTIySDMzaGE3X1o5RXNNemYzenUxeDZqczFjenJCQU81VnFQQUtrR1VnNXJqbnhrNGxPczdnSHhMVnQxbWhjTU9kOHNxa3hNeEJnS3LSAaIBQVVfeXFMT3laRFVRV0FfQ19mcWREbkxSTVNreDZZaTh1aThOdDh0LVAxN2tMdktUUDl2cDlMMUtlTWRJSzlfbGktWVktNHhSOFlsYjZUVktZVGJsNE5fQlZocF9zZmNOV3BLQzVQQUF6TG94cmFiWmNUcldPaWRDVFU0R054WFpaMW9PUWhIM0xkUUdKSjM3MXFxbUt3cWtIem5DLUo2Ykl3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People living in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/iowa/index.html" id="mol-baa475d0-2200-11f0-a330-01676fa8611e"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt; may be at the greatest risk of lung &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-baa0cc50-2200-11f0-a330-01676fa8611e"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the next decade, a new study suggests.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-baa400a0-2200-11f0-a330-01676fa8611e"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; San Diego surveyed 1.7million Americans in all 50 states to track rates of cigarette use from 1992 through 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also used that data to predict which states would have the most smokers in 2035.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found since the early 2000s, smoking rates have decreased by more than 60 percent nationwide, from 23 percent to 9.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Statewide, Utah recorded the lowest rate of smokers in 2022 with 4.4 percent. Maine, however, had the highest smoking rate in the country at 16.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And by 2035, even as nationwide smoking rates dip to just five percent on average, experts estimate Iowa's rate - which is about 16 percent - will remain unchanged, making it the highest in the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smoking and tobacco use is the number one cause of lung cancer, responsible for 80 to 90 percent of cases. The disease is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13490375/lung-cancer-rising-young-americans.html"&gt;America's deadliest and third-most common cancer&lt;/a&gt;, with 226,000 cases per year and 130,000 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while smoking is on the decline, lung cancer rates will take significantly longer to drop in areas with heavy smoking rates, researchers warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers at the University of California San Diego have revealed which states may be at the greatest risk of developing lung cancer (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows smoking rates per state in 2022. Darker colors are associated with higher smoking rates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also cautioned an increase in vaping among young people may further stall progress.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Matthew Stone, first study author and assistant professor at the UC San Diego Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health, said: 'The rapid decline in smoking among young adults is clear evidence that the smoking epidemic will come to an end in our lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Indeed, we project that the national smoking prevalence will be under five percent by 2035. However, the much slower decline in smokers over the age of 50, particularly in previously high smoking states, will mean that the high rates of lung cancer, heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that are caused by lifelong smoking will take longer to decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers analyzed US Census Bureau data on smoking and tobacco use from 1992 to 2022, which included responses from 1.7million Americans in 54,000 households.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vast majority (78 percent) were white, and the largest age group (30 percent) was 35 to 49-year-olds.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Respondents were asked 18 times whether they had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who responded 'yes' were asked if they currently smoked every day, some days or none at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers used the survey data to calculate a smoking rate for each state from 1992 to 2022 and a projected rate for 2035. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From 1992 to 2001, the national smoking rate was 23 percent. During that time, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/utah/index.html" id="mol-8d868150-21f2-11f0-a330-01676fa8611e"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; had the lowest rate of 15 percent while &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/kentucky/index.html" id="mol-8d84fab0-21f2-11f0-a330-01676fa8611e" class=""&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; had the highest at 31 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, by 2022, smoking dropped significantly down to nine percent nationwide. Utah again had the fewest smokers that year with a rate of just 4.4 percent, while &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/maine/index.html" id="mol-61d4b740-21f5-11f0-a330-01676fa8611e" class=""&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; had the highest at 16.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows smoking prevalence by state in 1992.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine which brain areas are necessary for a certain ability, researchers study patients with brain lesions (an area of damage in the brain) caused by stroke or brain tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach, known as ‘lesion-deficit mapping’, is the most powerful method for localising function in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studying brain injuries can be difficult and time-consuming because researchers need a large number of patients with specific brain damage. This kind of damage can affect how a person thinks, feels, or moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, very few research centres have access to enough patients to conduct these studies effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, previous studies have mainly relied on functional imaging (fMRI) techniques in healthy individuals. However, these results can sometimes be misleading as they provide correlational rather than causal evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study, led by researchers at the UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and Department of Neuropsychology at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCLH, used lesion-deficit mapping to investigate 247 patients with unilateral focal brain lesions in either the left or right frontal (front) or posterior (back) regions of the brain. An additional 81 healthy individuals served as controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess reasoning skills in these patients, the researchers developed two new tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These included a verbal deductive reasoning task (a type of puzzle where participants are asked to find relationships between words to solve problems), which included questions such as: &lt;em&gt;“If Sarah is smarter than Diana and Sarah is smarter than Heather, is Diane smarter than Heather?”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a nonverbal analogical reasoning task (a type of puzzle where participants are asked to use pictures, shapes or numbers to figure out logical patterns and solve problems), with questions like: &lt;em&gt;“Which set of numbers is 1,2,3 most similar to – 5,6,7 or 6,5,7?”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that people with damage to the right frontal lobe had a much harder time on both tests compared to those with damage in other areas. They made about 15% more mistakes than the other patients and healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author, Dr Joseph Mole (UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and Department of Neuropsychology, UCLH) said: “Our study explores how the front right part of the brain helps people think and solve new problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also shows that our two new tests can help detect reasoning problems in individuals with brain damage, improving diagnosis and treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior author, Professor Lisa Cipolotti (UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and Department of Neuropsychology, UCLH) added: “By combining a detailed cognitive investigation in a large sample of brain damaged patients with advanced lesion mapping techniques – developed by Professor Parashkev Nachev and his team at the UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology – we have deepened our understanding of the complex and, so far, poorly understood, neural structures underlying human reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show a close connection between the right frontal brain network involved in reasoning and the right frontal brain network essential for fluid intelligence (our ability to solve problems without prior experience).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that a common area of the brain plays a critical role in both reasoning and fluid intelligence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe that these findings have significant clinical implications, as the two new tests can help identify cognitive impairments that would otherwise go undetected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With further validation and implementation, the team aim to make their new reasoning tests widely available in the NHS, addressing an unmet need for tools specifically designed for assessing right frontal lobe dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by Wellcome and the National Institute for Health and Care Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre (NIHR UCLH BRC) funding scheme.

Yet, our understanding of the relationship between reasoning abilities and their neuroanatomical basis remains surprisingly limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aimed to conduct fine-grained anatomical mapping of performance on tests of AR, DR and fluid intelligence (Gf), in a large sample of patients with unilateral focal frontal or posterior lesions and healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We assessed 247 prospectively recruited patients using two new tests: the Analogical Reasoning Test (ART) and the Deductive Reasoning Test (DRT); and the best-established measure of Gf: Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-parametric Bayesian stochastic block modelling was used to reveal the community structure of lesion deficit networks, disentangling functional from confounding pathological distributed effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ART and DRT performance was significantly impaired in patients with frontal lesions [ART: &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;(2,238) = 18.93; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; Frontal group worse than Posterior group and healthy controls, both &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; DRT: &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;(2,387) = 18.491; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; Frontal group worse than healthy controls, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01]. Right frontal effects were evident on both tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, on the ART, right frontal patients were more impaired than left (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). On the DRT, right frontal patients were more impaired than left frontal patients on questions with indeterminate solutions (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) but not on questions with determinate ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-parametric Bayesian stochastic block modelling implicated a right frontal network in ART and DRT performance. Strikingly, we found that this network was also implicated in performance on RAPM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study represents the most robust investigation of AR and DR in the focally injured brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings imply that a right frontal network is critical. The ART and DRT appear to be promising new clinical tests, capable of evaluating reasoning abilities and identifying right frontal lobe dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 21:48:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTFBjR19QWGxlQUZkRVQydlE5X0xfZW9UdG9wN1pSSHNsNlZXSDFBWEpLazZmMUtIdmRrLWxIYzM2aWVqWWlGbDN1bGRJQkx0UDdEV0JTRE5yUGx6WXdKWGxvTG8zMlhxVENhN1lId1JIaEc4d21qdDhHYnFhel8</guid></item><item><title>脐带DNA可能预测未来的代谢健康风险-神经科学新闻 | Umbilical Cord DNA May Predict Future Metabolic Health Risks - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOTDUtSE9WbGJHYW1TeWVrWVdPOURSQl9vRmRoV3FkeURIN3c5VUc3WW9SR1RQQ3ZuQjhwVDlUd2NiSG9rSzJNVENHT3pRMG5CU2c4OVgxYjl3VUhNQmtvbzdEN1ZGcnlRYUM3ampxUEg3WjZkbWlWX29vOG5ic0h6RGROWEQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;DNA changes in umbilical cord blood may help predict which children are at higher risk for future health issues like diabetes, liver disease, and stroke.

They looked for changes in chemical tags — called methyl groups — on the infants’ DNA that switch genes on or off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When these switches occur in critical parts of the DNA, called imprint control regions, their effects can persist through fetal development and into later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team compared the DNA changes to health data collected when the children were 7 to 12 years old — including body mass index, liver fat, an indication of liver inflammation or damage known as alanine transaminase (ALT), triglyceride levels, blood pressure, and waist-to-hip ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They identified multiple regions of altered DNA associated with metabolic dysfunction later in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in a gene called &lt;em&gt;TNS3&lt;/em&gt; were linked to liver fat, ALT, and waist-to-hip ratio, while alterations in others, including &lt;em&gt;GNAS&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CSMD1&lt;/em&gt;, were connected to blood pressure, waist-to-hip ratio, and ALT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These epigenetic signals are laid down during embryonic development, potentially influenced by environmental factors such as nutrition or maternal health during pregnancy,” said co-author Cynthia Moylan, MD, associate professor of medicine, division of gastroenterology, at Duke University Health System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If validated in larger studies, this could open the door to new screening tools and early interventions for at-risk children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the sample size was small, the researchers say the findings are promising and warrant further investigation. A larger National Health Institute-funded follow-up study is underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current findings do not suggest a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the genetic changes and disease but highlight a potential biological pathway for further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just because you’re born with these markers doesn’t mean disease is inevitable,” Dr. Jowell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But knowing your risk earlier in life could help families and clinicians take proactive steps to support a child’s long-term health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6b050e1c18190404062b0c0a181f19044504190c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rachel Shubert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://gastro.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Digestive Disease Week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Rachel Shubert – Digestive Disease Week&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will be presented at the Digestive Disease Week 2025 conference.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 21:22:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOTDUtSE9WbGJHYW1TeWVrWVdPOURSQl9vRmRoV3FkeURIN3c5VUc3WW9SR1RQQ3ZuQjhwVDlUd2NiSG9rSzJNVENHT3pRMG5CU2c4OVgxYjl3VUhNQmtvbzdEN1ZGcnlRYUM3ampxUEg3WjZkbWlWX29vOG5ic0h6RGROWEQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
