  &lt;p&gt;As Brandes lay bleeding, Meiwes read a &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/michelelbird/funniest-star-trek-jokes"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; novel, periodically checking on him. Hours later, with Brandes drifting in and out of consciousness, Meiwes ended his life by stabbing him in the throat. Over the next 10 months, Meiwes consumed approximately 20 kilograms of Brandes's flesh, storing body parts in his freezer under pizza boxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meiwes was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/dec/04/germany.lukeharding" target="_blank"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; in December 2002 after an Austrian student alerted authorities to a new advertisement from Meiwes. Upon searching Meiwes's home, police found body parts and a videotape detailing the entire event. In court, Meiwes said the crime was something he had wanted to do for a long time, adding, "I always had the fantasy and in the end I fulfilled it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was convicted of manslaughter in 2004 and sentenced to eight and a half years, but given life in prison for murder after a 2006 retrial.&lt;/p&gt;

These are mathematical calculations, so they don’t necessarily represent what’s typical or healthy for you as an individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are so many factors that make our bodies unique — our size, our shape, our proportions — that comparing ourselves to others is rarely helpful. In fact, doing so often leads to negative self-talk and other harmful behaviors (thanks, social me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, it might be helpful to know you’re not the only one thinking about your weight. According to a nationally-representative survey conducted by Hims &amp;amp; Hers, 83 percent of Americans say they are not the weight they’d like to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average amount of weight folks are looking to lose? 42 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to learn more about the average weight for women in the United States, what women believe the ideal weight is, and the factors that influence your ability to hit your goal weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Drazen Zigic/Istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Ideal Weight, According to Women&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how Americans think about weight and weight loss, Hims &amp;amp; Hers conducted a nationally-representative &lt;a href="https://www.hims.com/forhims/image/upload/v1726056665/reports/The_Shape_of_America_Report_Final_2024.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 5,000 adults. We learned a lot about the often contradictory beliefs we hold about weight, including what we believe is normal for our own weight and the weight of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey found that women believe the ideal weight for women is 139 pounds. But when asked about their personal ideal weight, the answers changed. When speaking about themselves, the average goal weight for women reported by women in this study was 144 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's up with these discrepancies? According to Dr. Jessica Shepherd, chief medical officer at Hers, there are a few factors at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Body image is a multifaceted construct which includes positive and negative attitudes, thoughts, and behaviors," she says. "There can be discrepancies between actual and ideal weights due to gender, ethnicity, genetics, environment, and lifestyle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Rostislav_Sedlacek/Istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Average Weights Around the World&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;American women tend to weigh more than women in other parts of the world.

Your lifestyle habits are essential to achieving and maintaining a healthy weight and reducing your risk of weight-related health problems like &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/conditions/obesity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; and heart disease. So toss the weight chart in the trash and consider these tips instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a goal to aim for, a healthcare provider can let you know what a healthy weight range would be for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Focus on Nutrients&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutrition is one of the most important components of your overall health and wellness. Not only does a nutrient-rich diet provide the vitamins, minerals, fiber, antioxidants, and macronutrients (&lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/how-much-protein-eat-lose-weight" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, fats, and carbs) your body needs to thrive, but it also supports healthy weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few things to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eat mostly whole foods&lt;/b&gt;. These include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, and other lean proteins. This mix provides an array of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, and they’re rich in &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/fiber-for-weight-loss" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which helps you feel full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Minimize ultra-processed foods&lt;/b&gt;. Examples include soda, candy, and packaged snack foods. These tend to be high in saturated fat, sodium, and added sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Focus on nutrients versus calories&lt;/b&gt;. Rather than being laser-focused on counting calories, put nutrients first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Ladanifer/Istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Get Better Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not getting enough sleep will wreck anyone’s day, and things can go downhill fast if this is an ongoing problem. Sleep deprivation does more than just make you cranky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of sleep makes us more prone to sugar cravings and mindless eating.

Move Your Body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity is important for supporting your overall health and achieving your weight goals. Regular exercise helps you burn extra calories, lose weight, and put on muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For general health, experts recommend at least &lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:150 minutes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;150 minutes&lt;/a&gt; of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise weekly, plus strength training twice per week. For weight loss goals, this increases to 200 to 300 minutes per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/steps-a-day-lose-weight" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:getting your steps in;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;getting your steps in&lt;/a&gt;, here are a few things to try:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swimming&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jogging&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing martial arts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playing basketball&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining a group fitness class&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-intensity interval training (HIIT)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using resistance bands, dumbbells, or weight machines, or doing bodyweight exercises&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;KucherAV/ iStockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Consider Weight Loss Medications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When daily lifestyle habits alone aren’t enough to promote weight loss, many people find success with &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/weight-loss-medication" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weight loss medications;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;weight loss medications&lt;/a&gt;. Intended to be used alongside a healthy diet and exercise, some of the most popular and effective weight loss medications include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;GLP-1 receptor agonists&lt;/b&gt;. These work by mimicking the effects of the naturally occurring hormone GLP-1, which regulates appetite and food intake. By activating GLP-1 receptors in your brain, GLP-1s help promote fullness, slow digestion, and decrease cravings. Examples include liraglutide (Saxenda) and &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/weight-loss/compounded-semaglutide" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:semaglutide;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;semaglutide&lt;/a&gt; (Wegovy or Ozempic).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metformin&lt;/b&gt;. Metformin is primarily used to improve blood sugar regulation in those with type 2 diabetes, but it may also support weight loss by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6520185/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:decreasing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;decreasing&lt;/a&gt; appetite and reducing the absorption of glucose from food in the intestines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contrave&lt;/b&gt;. This is a combination of bupropion (an antidepressant and aid to quit smoking) and naltrexone (used for alcohol and opioid dependence). Bupropion helps reduce appetite and cravings, while naltrexone counteracts the effects of certain brain chemicals involved in food reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Topiramate&lt;/b&gt;. Topiramate is often used as an antiepileptic medication, but it can support weight loss by suppressing appetite and promoting feelings of fullness. It may also influence your brain's reward pathways, potentially reducing cravings for high-calorie foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Ridofranz/istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Nurture Social Connections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were never meant to do life alone, and this includes the journey to achieving a healthy weight. Social connections provide support, accountability, and encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37698801/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that people who have these types of networks experience better weight loss outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining a group fitness community or jogging with friends builds a sense of community and encouragement, making it easier to stay committed to &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/healthy-eating-habits" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy habits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthy habits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a strong social network can help provide outlets for healthier stress management. It’s also a place to share experiences, successes, and challenges with those on similar journeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Kateryna Onyshchuk/Istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Drink More Water&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay hydrated, primarily with plain water. &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/drinking-water-weight-loss" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; is essential for health, but it also helps keep you fuller for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to sip on water throughout the day to keep cravings at bay. If your goal is weight loss, drink water right before or during meals to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4901052/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:help promote fullness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;help promote fullness&lt;/a&gt; and prevent overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get tired of plain water, try:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Ridofranz/istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Finding the Healthiest Weight for You&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summing it up, the average weight for women in the U.S. is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:170.8 pounds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;170.8 pounds&lt;/a&gt;, but that doesn’t mean this is the ideal weight for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, there’s no “ideal” weight calculation that considers every woman’s body type or health requirements. And at the end of the day, health is more than a number on the scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While unrealistic beauty standards and societal pressures are pervasive, that doesn’t mean we have to accept them as the norm when examining the optimal weight range for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re on a mission to find the healthiest weight for you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prioritize healthy everyday habits&lt;/b&gt;. This means improving sleep, staying hydrated, nourishing your social connections, boosting your nutrition, and moving your body regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seek outside support&lt;/b&gt;. Friends and family can be excellent support systems, but sometimes professional health experts can offer invaluable guidance. Perhaps it makes sense for you to talk to a dietitian or connect with one of our licensed healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Focus on you.&lt;/b&gt; Weight management is personal. What’s most important is understanding your body and the best weight range for you personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/guides/emotional-balance" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Emotional Balance: Practical Tips For Uncertain Times;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Emotional Balance: Practical Tips For Uncertain Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/healthy-chicken-salad-recipe" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Recipe: Healthy Chicken Salad;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Recipe: Healthy Chicken Salad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This article originally appeared on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/average-weight-for-women" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Forhers.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Forhers.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; and was syndicated by &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://mediafeed.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:MediaFeed.org;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;MediaFeed.org&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 16:52:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE44UFkwZ0hOeWpGU3hXTE5HbEJBczFxZUM0eXlxeWw5MzUteUY2Z012STdDMXR6MGhkZEwzZzEzb0FNOHVNTnBZVURVWlppXzY2dHZwLU9mY0ZkMDBzekZhWDlSVF9OdUVYWTBpRWtlV2xuZw</guid></item><item><title>Texas Measles Outbreak Hits 400 Cases - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQLU9JTzd5RnRKdEx0dkhxVE1LYUlQSTJBWm9vZWR2N1BHZ0J5aDM3MDQzMmRSYkphR3BLdG1URVRpVmEzVVlhdlF2RThBQk5UMW56dEFNWHpFZVhlc3ZmNFc5akFTUk1uZFRid09jZ3Y1Tm9XTnlkeW5Sa3hYejJXM2dGd2JBdGVZWWVsZ21PQ2k4T3Z0dk12Qndla9IBoAFBVV95cUxOeGJfWE5fWHJpUEpUaHJwMnhhODZJbmR4ZTFTYmZJdzY2VHNCcFhYcFRfT3V4WXpaeDFWdmJ4a1JGdTdCM2lza2pQQm1PeFFFemp2aTQxa2NFRkY0T0dWU1UxZ2pPQXMybUZOOWsySk5RYTRlTkd1ZFc5SzBVMjFXMHJzenJPRjdyLVo3S3BNWjZYUGcyS3FQRFR4bDVfNVB3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

They also tend to have lower rates of high blood pressure and experience less physical pain. These findings come from a new population-based study published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/22423982.2024.2419698" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;International Journal of Circumpolar Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which compared people who sauna bathe regularly with those who do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most earlier findings on sauna use and health have been based on Finnish populations, where sauna bathing is deeply embedded in the culture. While northern Sweden also has a strong tradition of sauna use, little was known about how sauna habits relate to health in this population. The researchers wanted to understand whether regular sauna use was associated with measurable differences in physical and mental health and whether these associations held true outside of Finland. To do this, the research team used data from the &lt;a href="https://www.umu.se/en/research/infrastructure/norra-sveriges-monica-studie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2022 Northern Sweden MONICA study&lt;/a&gt;, a long-running health survey designed to monitor cardiovascular risk factors in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have done a lot of research on nursing in emergency and intensive care, but in recent years, I have developed a growing interest in health and nature,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.ltu.se/en/staff/a/asa-engstrom#h-Aboutme" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Åsa Engström&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the Luleå University of Technology. “In connection with that, I have read about the benefits of sauna bathing, such as its positive effects on cardiovascular health. We then had the opportunity to include questions about sauna bathing habits in the Northern Sweden MONICA Study, which allowed us to compare various health parameters between those who used saunas and those who did not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2022, a random sample of 1,180 adults aged 25 to 74 from the northern counties of Norrbotten and Västerbotten were invited to participate. Of these, 971 people (about 82 percent) answered questions about their sauna habits. Participants who reported sauna bathing at least once per month were categorized as “sauna bathers,” a group that made up 66 percent of the sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey collected a wide range of information, including demographic details, health status, lifestyle habits, and mental well-being. It also included specific questions about sauna use, such as how often participants used a sauna, how long they stayed in, the temperature of the sauna, and whether they bathed alone or with others. Other questions assessed participants’ levels of physical activity, smoking and drinking habits, sleep satisfaction, and experience of pain, anxiety, and depression. Participants also rated their general health, energy levels, and happiness on standard scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed several significant differences between people who used saunas regularly and those who did not. Sauna bathers were generally younger, more often male, and more likely to be physically active. They also smoked less, although they tended to drink alcohol more frequently—typically two to three times per week. Despite this, they reported better overall health. Compared to non-sauna bathers, they had lower rates of diagnosed high blood pressure and reported experiencing less physical pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health outcomes also differed between the two groups. Sauna bathers reported lower levels of anxiety and depression, and higher levels of energy and happiness. They also expressed greater satisfaction with their sleep patterns. Interestingly, these benefits were most noticeable among those who sauna bathed one to four times per month. Bathing more frequently than that did not lead to additional improvements in mental health or energy, and happiness scores were actually lower among those who used the sauna more than four times per month compared to moderate users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of sauna users in the study followed fairly typical sauna routines. Most stayed in the sauna for 15 to 20 minutes at a time, usually in one or two bouts per session. The temperature ranged between 60 and 80 degrees Celsius for most users, and electric saunas were the most common type. Most people bathed with others rather than alone, but relatively few combined sauna use with cold-water or ice swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that the association between sauna use and better health was not strongly tied to socioeconomic status. Sauna bathers and non-sauna bathers did not differ significantly in terms of education or where they lived. This suggests that the benefits seen among sauna bathers may not be explained solely by financial resources or living conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these results are consistent with previous studies suggesting health benefits from sauna use, the researchers caution that the study has limitations. One key limitation is its cross-sectional design, which means the data were collected at a single point in time. This makes it impossible to say whether sauna use causes better health, or whether healthier people are simply more likely to use saunas. Long-term studies or clinical trials would be needed to determine whether sauna use directly leads to health improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the group of sauna users tended to be younger and included more men, which may have influenced the results. Age and gender can both affect health outcomes independently of sauna use. Although the researchers compared groups statistically, more detailed analysis adjusting for these factors would be needed in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have begun analyzing more of the parameters in the MONICA data,” Engström said. “Our aim is to better understand the health effects of sauna bathing and how factors such as the environment and social context influence the experience.

Over time, my interest in the role of nutrition on sports performance and overall health grew, leading me to my current role as a dietitian. Instead of laminating pastry dough and frosting cakes, I’ve been able to merge my passions by creating desserts with benefits—aka sweet treats packed with nutrient-dense ingredients.  But let’s be real: Life gets busy, and I don’t always have time to whip up desserts and snacks. That’s why I’ve been hooked on &lt;a href="https://www.naturaldelights.com/products/cacao-pecan-mini-medjools" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Natural Delights Cacao Pecan Mini Medjools;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Natural Delights Cacao Pecan Mini Medjools&lt;/a&gt;, which can be found right in the produce aisle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These brownie-inspired date bites bring just the right combination of flavors and textures to the table: sweet, chocolaty, caramel-like, nutty, chewy and crunchy.  Craving a candy bar? The combination of a dense, chewy, caramel-like texture, rich, chocolaty flavor and satisfying crunch is sure to do the trick. Plus, this snack is made from just four simple ingredients and is free from added sugar and artificial additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hungry yet?  Join me as I dive into why this high-fiber, dessert-like snack is one that I never leave the grocery store without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Natural Delights Cacoa Pecan Mini Medjools Is a Great High-Fiber Snack&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon. EatingWell design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It’s Filling and Satisfying&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to filling power, some snacks just don’t cut it. But that’s not the case with these Mini Medjools. Each bite-size piece packs a trio of nutrients—complex carbs, protein and fiber—that work together to keep you full for longer and truly satisfied. Specifically, each four-piece serving provides 24 grams of carbohydrates, 5 grams of fiber and 3 grams of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It’s Blood Sugar–Friendly&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The snack’s combination of fiber and protein also helps to slow digestion, providing a steady release of sugar without causing large swings in your blood sugar levels. While you might worry that dates are off-limits if you have diabetes, they’re actually an incredibly nutrient-dense way to add sweetness without using added sugars. Plus, one review found that eating dates may actually help lower blood sugar levels, thanks to their high fiber content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It’s High in Fiber&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, this chewy snack is packed with an impressive 5 grams of fiber per four-piece serving. In addition to minimizing blood sugar spikes and increasing satiety, fiber plays an important role in heart and digestive health. Specifically, dates are high in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insoluble fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which helps prevent constipation and may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It Provides Several Essential Nutrients&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to fiber, these brownie-inspired bites contain numerous other important nutrients, largely thanks to their three main ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medjool dates &lt;/strong&gt;are a sweet source of complex carbohydrates, fiber and micronutrients like potassium, magnesium, folate, copper, calcium and iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pecans &lt;/strong&gt;are often overlooked except during the holidays (hello, &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/276928/mini-pecan-pies/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pecan pie!;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;pecan pie!&lt;/a&gt;). However, these buttery nuts provide heart-healthy unsaturated fats, fiber, plant-based protein and a wealth of micronutrients like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-when-you-consume-vitamin-e-regularly-8685814" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin E;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin E&lt;/a&gt;, copper and zinc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cacao powder and nibs &lt;/strong&gt;are packed with antioxidants, specifically flavonols, which protect against cell damage and support heart health. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013599/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-chocolate-every-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cacoa;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cacoa&lt;/a&gt; also contains fiber and micronutrients like magnesium and potassium.,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It Has Benefits for Your Heart&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fiber-rich snack isn’t just good for digestion, it’s also good for your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/heart-healthy-high-fiber-snack-recipes-8700225" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;. One study found that dates may improve heart health by lowering triglyceride, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/hdl-vs-ldl-cholesterol-whats-the-difference-11678853" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:LDL cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and total cholesterol levels while boosting beneficial HDL cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The snack’s inclusion of cacao and pecans further boosts its heart-healthy benefits. For example, one study found that adults at risk for heart disease who swapped their usual snacks with pecans for 12 weeks saw meaningful reductions in cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Meanwhile, cacao’s &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2051586/best-antioxidant-rich-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:flavonoid;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;flavonoid&lt;/a&gt; content may help reduce chronic inflammation, lower triglyceride levels and improve blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Choose a High-Fiber Snack&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snack time is a great opportunity to increase the amount of fiber in your diet; the key is knowing what to look for. Here are a few tips for choosing a nutritious, high-fiber snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim for 3 grams of fiber per serving or more&lt;/strong&gt;: Specifically, look for snacks containing at least 3 grams of fiber per serving. While some snacks are fortified, others contain natural fiber sources, like fruits, veggies, lentils, nuts, seeds and whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit added sugars: &lt;/strong&gt;Ideally, look for snacks that are naturally sweetened with fruit and limit those containing high amounts of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7912011/whats-the-big-deal-about-sugar-we-have-your-questions-answered/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:added sugar.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;added sugar.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay attention to the ingredient list: &lt;/strong&gt;In general, snacks with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-fiber-snack-recipes-with-3-ingredients-or-less-8725256" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:short, simple ingredient lists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;short, simple ingredient lists&lt;/a&gt; are less likely to contain artificial additives or preservatives. They often tend to be lower in added sugar and unhealthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose whole grains: &lt;/strong&gt;Whole grain–based snacks are typically higher in fiber and other essential nutrients than their refined counterparts. Whole-grain crackers, oat-based granola bars and popcorn are all great &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7898414/what-are-whole-grains/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:whole-grain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;whole-grain&lt;/a&gt; options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Include protein&lt;/strong&gt;: The combination of protein and fiber can be especially helpful for satiety and managing blood sugar levels. Nuts, seeds, nut butters, trail mixes, edamame, roasted chickpeas and hummus are all great examples of foods offering this beneficial duo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for fruit- or vegetable-based options:&lt;/strong&gt; Fruits and vegetables are important sources of fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Look for snacks that incorporate them in any form—fresh, frozen, dried or canned. For example, a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8034765/a-month-of-veggie-packed-smoothies/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:smoothie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;smoothie&lt;/a&gt; is a refreshing way to add a dose of both fruit and leafy greens, while fruit leathers and dehydrated veggie chips are good for taking on the go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next time you’re in the produce department, don’t forget to grab a container of Natural Delights Cacao Pecan Mini Medjools.

While he takes three of them - turmeric, saffron, and garlic - as pills every day, you should consult your doctor before taking any new supplements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking to DailyMail.com, Dr. Aziz said: 'Of course, you can't just have the spices - you have to eat the greens and avoid the chemicals and all the ultra-processed foods too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But spices are the anti-aging add-ons. They are like the superstars, the supernovas, for combatting aging.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Below, DailyMail.com details Dr. Aziz's favorite supplements.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Michael Aziz reveals how to reset the biological clock and improve your health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Turmeric: Boost muscles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Famous for its earthy flavor and orange-yellow color, turmeric is a staple in many Southeastern Asian dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rhizome (a root-like underground stem) contains the compound curcumin, which scientists say can help slash levels of inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Several reviews have also suggested curcumin 'improves muscular performance' and helps them to recover after vigorous exercise - linking this to its anti-inflammatory effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above image shows a variety of turmeric spices, which are said to contain anti-inflammatory properties &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One&lt;a target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00812-6"&gt; 2017 research study from&lt;/a&gt;, which administered turmeric oil to mice, also concluded the spice has anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The papers suggest people consume one to four grams of curcumin - at least 33 grams of turmeric or 11 teaspoons worth - per day to achieve these benefits. Or, you can take curcumin supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Turmeric has previously been held up as a possible treatment for the 53 million adults in the US who suffer from arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the Arthritis Foundation pushed back against the claims, saying it&lt;span&gt; 'only contains about two to six percent curcumin, so you're not getting much [of the anti-inflammatory effect].'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The group explained that simply adding turmeric to your favorite meal would do little as the curcumin levels would be so low. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, it is a must-have in Aziz's longevity kitchen. He consumes it daily either in pill form or as a shot or small juice drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Garlic: Wrinkle eradicator&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Garlic is one of eight spices Dr. Michael Aziz claims can help you live longer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Garlic is considered to be a superfood worldwide, with many experts suggesting it can lower inflammation, blood pressure and boost the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Aziz suggests the allium can be used to help prevent wrinkles, though Brooklyn-based Dr. Mert Erogul and others remain skeptical about the claim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says that garlic contains a compound called allicin, which contains sulfur. Sulfur plays a key role in creating and maintaining collagen, which keeps the skin elastic and firm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Erogul told DailyMail.com, 'It is a significant leap to assert that garlic can prevent wrinkles ... even if there's some theoretical justification for the claim. Although, to be clear, I am not sure that there is in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ultimately, the only way we can know whether these claims are true is by putting them to the test - definitive proof that a substance has a specific health effect typically requires costly and extensive controlled trials.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Aziz takes a garlic pill every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Aziz also recommended cinnamon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Cinnamon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cinnamon is a favorite spice used for flavoring food and drinks, but it's also been revered by many communities for centuries because of its medicinal properties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists believe cinnamaldehyde - a compound found in the oils of the dried plant - is responsible for much of the spice's health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cinnamon is high in antioxidants, and has also been linked to reducing triglycerides, cholesterol, and blood sugar, according to studies reviewed by &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-proven-benefits-of-cinnamon#TOC_TITLE_HDR_5"&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Dr. Aziz believes it may reduce the risk of someone developing Alzheimer's disease - he pointed to a &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1043661817311659"&gt;few lab studies&lt;/a&gt; showing cinnamon could prevent the formation of tau proteins, which form clumps in the brain - there is no evidence to support it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists say more research is needed, and Dr. Erogul described the claim as another 'significant leap.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Ginger &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ginger is packed with nutrients that Dr. Aziz claims can reduce inflammation in the brain &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ginger is popular for its anti-nausea effects and has also been used medicinally for centuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some people may experience side effects after consuming either fresh or dried ginger, its compounds are generally known to have positive effects on digestion and the ability to settle an upset stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ginger-for-nausea#effectiveness"&gt;Healthline reports&lt;/a&gt; there are certain groups of people (those with gallbladder disease, people who are pregnant and have a history of miscarriage, anyone taking blood thinners, and more) who should be cautious and consult with their doctors when deciding whether to consume ginger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Aziz says he always orders a ginger shot whenever he visits his local juice bar, but does not consume it every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He suggests it can help prevent mental decline, but experts say more research is needed, and that its mental health benefits have not yet been proven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Ginseng&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists found that the Ginseng plant (pictured) contains 50 types of ginsenosides - the compound linked to boosted health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ginseng has been used in Chinese medicine for more than 100 years, and is credited with a wide range of health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Made from the roots of the ginseng plant, scientists found it contains 50 types of ginsenosides - compounds linked to boosted health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mount Sinai in New York compiled a long list of ailments the root may be able to help alleviate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The healthcare organization also said there is 'some evidence' Asian ginseng can help boost the immune system, reduce the risk of cancer, and improve mental performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;American ginseng contains the same components but in different amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1226845324000344"&gt;2024 review&lt;/a&gt; found older adults taking American ginseng had improved cognition, especially when it was taken alongside early Alzheimer's drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16566675/"&gt;a 2006 study&lt;/a&gt; found that COLD-FX, a dietary supplement that contains extract of North American ginseng, could reduce the risk of catching a cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But scientists cautioned these were only preliminary findings and that more research is needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Aziz believes the root 'can help lower [blood] sugar levels, lower cholesterol, promote relaxation, improves sexual dysfunction in men, and is used to treat a wide range of medical conditions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Cardamom&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Antioxidants found in cardamom (pictured) could help to lower blood pressure, Dr. Aziz said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another ancient spice believed to have healing properties, cardamom is often added to curries, cookies, sweets, coffee, and spiced cakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Aziz says it may be able to act as a blood pressure reducer, though Dr. Erogul said he wanted to see larger scale trials take place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fsn3.3738"&gt;2023 review&lt;/a&gt; found patients who took cardamom had significantly lower inflammation and blood pressure compared to those who did not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review included more than 500 patients, who were mostly overweight or obese. Many had type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Saffron&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Saffron is extremely highly regarded in many cultures and has a huge presence in Persian and Middle Eastern foods. It's also expensive to buy, compared to the rest of the grocery store's spice rack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows saffron, which is from a crocus flower&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it does not directly combat aging, Dr. Aziz said there is an established link between taking the spice and a better mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4643654/"&gt;A meta-analysis of five studies&lt;/a&gt; previously found saffron supplements were more effective than placebos at easing mild to moderate depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One paper claimed the spice is as effective as common antidepressants like fluoxetine - sold under the brand name Prozac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6503633/#:~:text=Conclusion%3A%20The%20findings%20of%20this,comparable%20with%20Fluoxetine%20and%20placebo."&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;included nearly 200 people who took saffron for six to 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In its conclusion, researchers said: 'The findings of this study showed that saffron administration was well comparable with Fluoxetine and placebo.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists said it may have these effects because the spice contains the compound crocin, which a 2022 review suggested can boost nerves in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added this could boost levels of the feel-good hormone serotonin, improving someone's mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Aziz takes a saffron supplement every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Za'atar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Za'atar has been linked to anti-aging properties&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This Middle Eastern spice blend varies by region, but often includes oregano, thyme, sesame seeds, and sumac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With its antioxidant levels, za'atar has been linked to a range of anti-aging properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oregano contains polyphenols like flavonoids, which can help to reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thyme also contains substances that reduce inflammation - as does sumac, which is extremely high in antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2022 &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464622000639#s0125"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found compounds in za'atar regulate the gut microbiome, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It&lt;span&gt; is a 'blend of anti-aging weapons from all over the world,' Dr. Aziz says. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Carrots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Carrots are jam-packed with vitamin A, an important nutrient for vision, growth, cell division, reproduction and immunity, according to the Mayo Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-021-01063-3"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; that root vegetables are also filled with microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's because plants absorb microplastics in water and soil through their roots, and the majority of these particles become concentrated in this part of the plant with only a tiny amount travelling up to the shoots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therefore, leafy vegetables such as lettuces and cabbage contain lower amounts of microplastics compared to root vegetables such as carrots, radishes and turnips, according to one study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you want to reduce your microplastics intake by eating fewer carrots, but still want a healthy dose of vitamin A in your diet, try swapping them out for spinach or red, yellow and orange bell peppers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;2. Plant-based nuggets  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A study that tested different types of proteins for microplastic contamination found that plant-based nuggets contained the second-highest amount of plastic particles &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749123022352"&gt;Researchers tested different types of proteins for microplastic contamination&lt;/a&gt;, and found that plant-based nuggets are one of the main culprits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the four different plant-based proteins they tested, the chicken nugget alternatives had the highest level of microplastics contamination at 0.32 particles per gram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is due to the fact that these nuggets are highly processed and tend to be packaged in plastic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rather than buying processed, packaged plant-based nuggets at the store, trying making them at home using tofu or seitan to reduce your plastic consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;3. Apples &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An apple a day keeps the doctor away, or so the saying goes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this popular fruit actually contains more microplastics than any other, with one &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120305703"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;finding they have more than 100,000 particles per gram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like carrots, apple trees absorb microplastics through their roots, which ultimately find their way into the fruit they produce. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you want a safer alternative, choose fruits that contain anthocyanins, a type of antioxidant that may protect the body against some of the harmful effects of microplastics, according to new research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some examples of Anthocyanin-packed fruits include blueberries, cranberries, pomegranates and grapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;4. Rice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One study has shown that people consume three to four milligrams of plastic for every 100 grams of rice they eat, and instant rice is worse &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rice is a healthy source of carbohydrates, fiber and B vitamins. But eating it also gives you a dose of plastic contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://stories.uq.edu.au/news/2021/instant-rice-packs-a-plastic-punchinstant-rice-packs-a-plastic-punch/index.html"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;has shown that people consume three to four milligrams of plastic for every 100 grams of rice they eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And when it comes to instant rice, that number jumps to 13 milligrams per serving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rice picks up plastic particles from the soil it grows in, the machines used to pick, store and move it, as well as the processing, packaging and handling it goes through before ending up on your plate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study found that washing rice before cooking it reduces plastic contamination by 20 to 40 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;5. Bottled water&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This one will come as no surprise. Water packaged in plastic bottles is teeming with microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/plastic-particles-bottled-water#:~:text=The%20researchers%20found%20that%2C%20on,mostly%20focused%20on%20larger%20microplastics."&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found that on average, a liter of bottled water contained about 240,000 plastic particles, and about 90 percent of them were nanoplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nanoplastics are 150 times smaller than a hair, and research suggests they are small enough to get inside human cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fortunately, it's easy to eliminate plastic-bottled water from your life by purchasing a reusable water bottle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;6. Ready-to-eat salads&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It's difficult to pinpoint exactly how many microplastics are packed into these quick, light lunches, as they vary widely in terms of packaging, size and ingredients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like bottled water, the microplastic contamination in ready-to-eat salads stems from the packaging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's difficult to pinpoint exactly how many microplastics are packed into these quick, light lunches, as they vary widely in terms of packaging, size and ingredients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But its inevitable that tiny pieces of the plastic packaging will shed into your salad. So if you want to avoid them, it's best to make your own salad using fresh, washed vegetables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;7. Seafood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0281596"&gt;recent study &lt;/a&gt;showed that the amount of microplastics in the ocean has been doubling every six years over the last four decades, and those particles make their way into our seafood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clams, mussels, crabs and nearly every type of fish are a few examples of seafoods that contain very high amounts of microplastics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, one &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9819327/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20in%20European%20countries,still%20represents%20a%20considerable%20exposure%20%5B"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;estimated that people who eat large amounts of shellfish ingest about 11,000 microplastic particles each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unfortunately, there is not an easy swap for seafood, as microplastics can be found in practically every kind of fish and shellfish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But you can reduce your microplastics intake by cutting back on your seafood consumption and trying to avoid highly processed fish, such as frozen fish filets.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;8. Pink Himalayan sea salt &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Highly-processed American table salt is the safest option when it comes to microplastic contamination&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pink Himalayan sea salt is widely considered healthy because it is minimally processed and therefore contains more minerals that the body needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But interestingly, researchers have found that processed salt contains far fewer microplastics than less processed salts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, one &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46173"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found that highly-processed, conventional table salt in the US contained significantly fewer microplastics than minimally processed salts, such as those used in Asian countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's because unrefined salts contain plastic pollution from the oceans they are harvested from, and in this case, processing actually works to remove much of those microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pink Himalayan sea salt is especially high in microplastics both because it is unrefined and because of the mining methods used to extract it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thus, highly processed American table salt is the safest option when it comes to avoiding microplastic contamination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;9. Processed dairy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With the exception of salt, highly processed foods generally contain more microplastics, and this is definitely true for conventional dairy products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have shown that highly processed dairy products such as powdered cheese and conventional milk contain significantly more microplastics than minimally processed alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To reduce your microplastics intake from dairy, reach for locally-sourced, organic milk, cheese and yoghurt at the store instead of the processed stuff.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;10.  Tea in nylon bags &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nylon mesh tea bags release billions of micro- and nanoplastics into a single cup of tea&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nylon tea bags release tons of microplastics into your hot cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31552738/"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found that steeping a single nylon mesh tea bag in 200°F water releases roughly 11.6 billion microplastics and 3.1 billion nanoplastics into a cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using tea in paper tea bags, or loose leaf tea and a reusable stainless steel strainer, are much safer options when it comes to limiting microplastic exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;11. Seaweed &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just like seafood and sea salts, microplastics make their way into seaweed products too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These particles become trapped on the surface of seaweed, clinging to its tiny crevices and fibers. One &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030881462400966X"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found that conventional washing methods are ineffective in removing most microplastics from seaweed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seaweed is eaten all over the world, but is a predominant staple of Asian diets. That same study found that people in China consume more than 17,000 microplastics per person per year through seaweed consumption alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That represents 13 percent of their total annual microplastics intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you love seaweed-wrapped sushi but want to cut down on your microplastics consumption, try making it with rice paper, lettuce or thinly-sliced cucumbers instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;12. Honey&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One study found that honey made in urban environments contained far more microplastics than honey made in rural environments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have tested honey from all over the world for microplastics, and found that this food staple is widely contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this case, the microplastic pollution does not come from processing, but rather the bees themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When honeybees forage for pollen in polluted environments, they pick up plastic particles that eventually make their way into the honey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is likely why one &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://12ft.io/proxy"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found that honey made in urban environments contained far more microplastics than honey made in rural environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therefore, you can cut down on your plastic consumption by purchasing honey made in rural locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A contraceptive implant is a thin and flexible rod that sits under the skin and releases contraceptive drugs into the body for years. While it’s one of the &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/contraception/choosing-contraception/how-well-it-works-at-preventing-pregnancy/"&gt;most effective forms of contraceptives&lt;/a&gt; and avoids the inconvenience of having to take a pill every day, the implant requires minor surgery, which can limit accessibility. To make life a bit easier, researchers are creating a self-assembling contraceptive implant the components of which women could self-administer with a single injection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A team of researchers has developed the technology for self-injectable contraceptive shots that work similarly to contraceptive implants. As detailed in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44286-025-00194-x"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published Monday in the journal Nature Chemical Engineering, the shots would result in a highly effective and long-term contraceptive method more accessible to women who lack easy access to medical infrastructure. Additionally, the design could be used to administer other long-term medications, such as those for HIV.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new approach delivers the contraceptive hormonal medication levonorgestrel via what the researchers call “Self-assembling Long-acting Injectable Microcrystals” (SLIM). Once injected into the body, the tiny crystals assemble into an implant, or a drug “depot,” that releases levonorgestrel as it erodes over months or years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="not-prose video-container"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;iframe title="Self-Aggregating Long-Acting Injectable Microcystals" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BnK_HjO76Jk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The overarching goal is to give women access to a lot of different formats for contraception that are easy to administer, compatible with being used in the developing world, and have a range of different timeframes of durations of action,” Vivian Feig, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University and co-author on the study, said in a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/engineers-develop-better-way-to-deliver-long-lasting-drugs-0324"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Traditional &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/4086-depo-provera-birth-control-shot"&gt;birth control shots&lt;/a&gt; already exist and are more accessible than the contraceptive implant because patients can give themselves the shots without having to visit a hospital or medical clinic. However, they are slightly less effective than the implant and are not long-lasting, so they must be administered every three months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers’ new contraceptive design joins the accessibility of self-administered shots with the long-term efficacy of an implant. The challenge of self-administering technologies similar to SLIM, however, has been the large (and hence painful) needle size necessary to inject the medication. By contrast, the team’s formula—tiny crystals and a solvent (in this case a liquid compound called benzyl benzoate)—allows for the use of much smaller needles.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Needle size and liquid viscosity are crucial considerations for commercial translation of injectables,” said Giovanni Traverso, senior author of the study and a gastroenterologist at MIT and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in a Mass General Brigham &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/new-non-surgical-contraceptive-implant-delivered-through-tiny-needles"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Our engineering challenge was finding a way to maximize comfort for patients by using smaller needles, which cause less bruising or bleeding, and to make the viscosity low enough for easy application with the syringe by hand.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Traverso and his colleagues can modify the mixture to “modulate the drug release rate, extending its duration while maintaining injectability,” MIT graduate student Sanghyun Park explained in the MIT statement. “This demonstrates the tunability of our system, which can be engineered to accommodate a broader range of contraceptive needs as well as tailored dosing regimens for other therapeutic applications.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While SLIM hasn’t gone through clinical trials yet, the development of the technology in preclinical models paves the way for more convenient and effective future long-term medications.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; My childhood dream was to go to pastry school to create beautiful, delicious desserts. Over time, my interest in the role of nutrition on sports performance and overall health grew, leading me to my current role as a dietitian. Instead of laminating pastry dough and frosting cakes, I’ve been able to merge my passions by creating desserts with benefits—aka sweet treats packed with nutrient-dense ingredients.  But let’s be real: Life gets busy, and I don’t always have time to whip up desserts and snacks. That’s why I’ve been hooked on &lt;a href="https://www.naturaldelights.com/products/cacao-pecan-mini-medjools" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Natural Delights Cacao Pecan Mini Medjools&lt;/a&gt;, which can be found right in the produce aisle.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to filling power, some snacks just don’t cut it. But that’s not the case with these Mini Medjools. Each bite-size piece packs a trio of nutrients—complex carbs, protein and fiber—that work together to keep you full for longer and truly satisfied. Specifically, each four-piece serving provides 24 grams of carbohydrates, 5 grams of fiber and 3 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Blood Sugar–Friendly &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The snack’s combination of fiber and protein also helps to slow digestion, providing a steady release of sugar without causing large swings in your blood sugar levels. While you might worry that dates are off-limits if you have diabetes, they’re actually an incredibly nutrient-dense way to add sweetness without using added sugars. Plus, one review found that eating dates may actually help lower blood sugar levels, thanks to their high fiber content.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s High in Fiber  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Speaking of which, this chewy snack is packed with an impressive 5 grams of fiber per four-piece serving. In addition to minimizing blood sugar spikes and increasing satiety, fiber plays an important role in heart and digestive health. Specifically, dates are high in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which helps prevent constipation and may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Provides Several Essential Nutrients &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to fiber, these brownie-inspired bites contain numerous other important nutrients, largely thanks to their three main ingredients: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medjool dates &lt;/strong&gt;are a sweet source of complex carbohydrates, fiber and micronutrients like potassium, magnesium, folate, copper, calcium and iron.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pecans &lt;/strong&gt;are often overlooked except during the holidays (hello, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/276928/mini-pecan-pies/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pecan pie!&lt;/a&gt;). However, these buttery nuts provide heart-healthy unsaturated fats, fiber, plant-based protein and a wealth of micronutrients like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-when-you-consume-vitamin-e-regularly-8685814" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin E&lt;/a&gt;, copper and zinc.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cacao powder and nibs &lt;/strong&gt;are packed with antioxidants, specifically flavonols, which protect against cell damage and support heart health. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013599/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-chocolate-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Cacoa&lt;/a&gt; also contains fiber and micronutrients like magnesium and potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Has Benefits for Your Heart &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A fiber-rich snack isn’t just good for digestion, it’s also good for your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/heart-healthy-high-fiber-snack-recipes-8700225" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;. One study found that dates may improve heart health by lowering triglyceride, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/hdl-vs-ldl-cholesterol-whats-the-difference-11678853" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and total cholesterol levels while boosting beneficial HDL cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The snack’s inclusion of cacao and pecans further boosts its heart-healthy benefits. For example, one study found that adults at risk for heart disease who swapped their usual snacks with pecans for 12 weeks saw meaningful reductions in cholesterol and triglyceride levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Meanwhile, cacao’s &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2051586/best-antioxidant-rich-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;flavonoid&lt;/a&gt; content may help reduce chronic inflammation, lower triglyceride levels and improve blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-choose-a-high-fiber-snack"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt;  How to Choose a High-Fiber Snack &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;  Snack time is a great opportunity to increase the amount of fiber in your diet; the key is knowing what to look for. Here are a few tips for choosing a nutritious, high-fiber snack. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim for 3 grams of fiber per serving or more&lt;/strong&gt;: Specifically, look for snacks containing at least 3 grams of fiber per serving. While some snacks are fortified, others contain natural fiber sources, like fruits, veggies, lentils, nuts, seeds and whole grains.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit added sugars: &lt;/strong&gt;Ideally, look for snacks that are naturally sweetened with fruit and limit those containing high amounts of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7912011/whats-the-big-deal-about-sugar-we-have-your-questions-answered/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;added sugar.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay attention to the ingredient list: &lt;/strong&gt;In general, snacks with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-fiber-snack-recipes-with-3-ingredients-or-less-8725256" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;short, simple ingredient lists&lt;/a&gt; are less likely to contain artificial additives or preservatives. They often tend to be lower in added sugar and unhealthy fats. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose whole grains: &lt;/strong&gt;Whole grain–based snacks are typically higher in fiber and other essential nutrients than their refined counterparts. Whole-grain crackers, oat-based granola bars and popcorn are all great &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7898414/what-are-whole-grains/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;whole-grain&lt;/a&gt; options. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Include protein&lt;/strong&gt;: The combination of protein and fiber can be especially helpful for satiety and managing blood sugar levels. Nuts, seeds, nut butters, trail mixes, edamame, roasted chickpeas and hummus are all great examples of foods offering this beneficial duo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for fruit- or vegetable-based options:&lt;/strong&gt; Fruits and vegetables are important sources of fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Look for snacks that incorporate them in any form—fresh, frozen, dried or canned. For example, a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8034765/a-month-of-veggie-packed-smoothies/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;smoothie&lt;/a&gt; is a refreshing way to add a dose of both fruit and leafy greens, while fruit leathers and dehydrated veggie chips are good for taking on the go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;  Next time you’re in the produce department, don’t forget to grab a container of Natural Delights Cacao Pecan Mini Medjools. Packed with fiber and with a wonderfully chewy consistency, this snack offers numerous health benefits in a small, yet satisfying package.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been five years since the start of a zoonotic COVID-19 pandemic that &lt;a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;killed millions of people&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the United Nations is urging member governments to take coordinated action to address &lt;a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the “unprecedented” spread of highly pathogenic bird flu&lt;/a&gt; — a threat to health, food security, biodiversity and more. The world has reached an inflection point, another chance to do what is needed to prevent a health crisis.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will either be remembered as the moment we failed to save lives or the moment we finally reckoned with the dangers of factory farming and our mass exploitation of animals. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The warning from the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization came on March 17, the same day the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-reported-first-outbreak-h7n9-bird-flu-farm-since-2017-woah-says-2025-03-17/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a new U.S. outbreak of dangerous H7N9 bird flu&lt;/a&gt; was reported. Since it first emerged in 2013, the strain has a nearly 40 percent mortality rate in humans, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/westernpacific/wpro-emergencies/surveillance/avian-influenza"&gt;translating to 616 human deaths&lt;/a&gt; in China. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite troubling signs that &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/severe-bird-flu-cases-virus-can-mutate-lingers-body-rcna186009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the virus is mutating and could become more transmissible&lt;/a&gt;, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s $1 billion strategy to fight bird flu is &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trumps-plan-combat-bird-flu-will-ensure-more-bird-flu-opinion-2042335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;likely to create more danger,&lt;/a&gt; as the federal agency funnels $400 million into factory farms as reimbursements for chickens lost. In so doing, it is propping up the very industry fueling the spread of zoonotic disease.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since early 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nearly 170 million farmed birds have died or been killed&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. due to bird flu outbreaks, equivalent to roughly half the country’s human population. Just since last year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;70 human cases&lt;/a&gt; have been reported, the majority of which resulted from direct exposure to livestock. Three came from unknown sources. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We already know that &lt;a href="https://www.emro.who.int/fr/about-who/rc61/zoonotic-diseases.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;75 percent of emerging human pathogens are zoonotic&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, by farming animals in the billions, we are playing with fire. Factory farms confine thousands of animals into unsanitary facilities, where workers are &lt;a href="https://investigatemidwest.org/2024/12/04/bird-flu-ppe-access-in-dairy-producing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;often left unprotected&lt;/a&gt; from disease.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While some have blamed wild birds for the presence of bird flu on large-scale farms, it is more likely that &lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/can-wild-birds-spread-avian-influenza-domestic-poultry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;failures to prevent diseases from spreading on farms are the real culprits&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, research has shown that &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250224/Study-finds-strong-evidence-that-bird-flu-spreads-through-the-air-between-farms.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ventilation systems on factory farms may be fueling airborne transmission&lt;/a&gt; of bird flu; &lt;a href="https://time.com/7212477/wastewater-testing-farms-bird-flu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;scientists are currently tracking&lt;/a&gt; wastewater from these intensive operations as a potential avenue for the virus’s spread. The hazards of factory farms themselves are compounded by the clearing of forests for animal agriculture, which diminishes planetary resilience and pushes humans and wildlife into &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/analysis-how-deforestation-helps-deadly-viruses-jump-from-animals-to-humans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ever closer contact and toward a higher risk of disease transmission&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than protecting the public, the U.S. government remains focused on bolstering corporations and lowering egg prices, which, according to a recent report, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/04/egg-prices-bird-flu-corporate-profits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;have likely been artificially inflated&lt;/a&gt; by agribusiness titans taking advantage of consumers. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;As the USDA bails out animal agriculture and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggests that the nation &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;allow bird flu to spread through its poultry industry&lt;/a&gt;, it is critical that a country in which &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;99 percent of all farmed animals are kept on factory farms&lt;/a&gt; begin taking this escalating threat seriously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600" alt="" class="wp-image-4329764" srcset="https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w" sizes="(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;To protect the health of animals and humans, the Trump administration should quickly shift support away from factory farming in favor of a safer and more sustainable plant-based food system. Otherwise, we could be reflecting on an even deadlier pandemic five years from now.  &lt;/p&gt;

Now, researchers are proposing an enhanced metric, which combines the two using basic math: Divide your average daily heart rate by your daily average number of steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The resulting ratio — the daily heart rate per step, or DHRPS — provides insight into how efficiently the heart is working, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.036801" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;according to a study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by researchers at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University and published today in the Journal of the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The study found that people whose hearts work less efficiently, by this metric, were more prone to various diseases, including Type II diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, stroke, coronary atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“It’s a measure of inefficiency,” said Zhanlin Chen, a third-year medical student at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University and lead author of the new study; his coauthors included several Feinberg faculty physicians. “It looks at how badly your heart is doing,” he added. “You’re just going to have to do a tiny bit of math.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Some experts said they saw wisdom in DHRPS as a metric. Dr. Peter Aziz, a pediatric cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, said it appeared to be an advance on the information provided by daily steps or average heart rate alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“What is probably more important for cardio fitness is what your heart does for the amount of work it has to do,” he said. “This is a reasonable way to measure that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The metric does not look at heart rate during exercise. But, Dr. Aziz said, it still provided an overall sense of efficiency that, importantly, was shown by researchers to have an association with disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The size of the study added validity to the findings, Dr. Aziz said. The scientists mapped Fitbit data from nearly 7,000 Smartwatch users against electronic medical records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Chen said that a simple way to grasp the value of the new metric was to compare two hypothetical individuals. Both take 10,000 steps a day, but one has an average daily resting heart rate of 80 — in the middle of the healthy range — while the other’s daily resting heart rate is 120.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The first person would have a DHRPS of 0.008, the second 0.012. The higher the ratio, the stronger the signaling of cardiac risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In the study, the 6,947 participants were divided into three groups based on their ratios; those with the highest showed a stronger association with disease than other participants did. The D.H.R.P.S. metric was also better at revealing disease risk than were step counts or heart rates alone, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“We designed this metric to be low-cost and to use data we’re already collecting,” Mr. Chen said. “People who want to be in charge of their own health can do a little bit of math to figure this out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 13:30:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxNVlA3QjFsc3ZIRzlMMVFDaFd3SzFZMHhCUlJ6akJxdnlyTHF5Q2ZPeE5lWVE0UkFqdzNtVXhDX2VPNks3bzNFVTFMcmlmRTdCX2tzdzc0TlJEU3pDQjlneVdZMEJubVluNE5SUFF5WFI3MEtLalpBSGliYmEtcFRZN0JB</guid></item><item><title>Kansas lawmakers want to loosen vaccine requirements amid measles outbreak in the state - Hays Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTFBQUTY4Y20ybVRiVXRLbkUwMmVodFdWMUNMQ0N6TnhYYXNHMmhaaHdydDlDNTRjNVNOd0YwN2l5WC1NVUZmWllsNW1QVlVZNW5wR1ZramZTOWNyMUFFdERJQWVKZmxJQnhiSmQ3OUx1Mmk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="p-4 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-loose"&gt;&lt;figure class="py-8"&gt;&lt;img class="mx-auto w-full sm:w-full md:w-full" src="https://media.eaglewebservices.com/public/2025/3/1743085628490.png" alt="A rash caused by the measles on a child's face.

Health officials urge full vaccination against the disease.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An outbreak of measles in southwest Kansas continues to grow. &lt;a href="https://kshealthdata.kdhe.ks.gov/t/KDHE/views/InfectiousDiseaseCaseDashboard/DiseaseCharts?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y" target="_blank"&gt;State health data shows&lt;/a&gt; 23 people in six counties have tested positive for measles since the start of this year. Data released on Wednesday showed the number of cases and counties affected by the spread have doubled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kansas Department of Health and Environment first &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1483" target="_blank"&gt;reported a measles case in Stevens County March 13&lt;/a&gt;, stating it was the first measles case in Kansas since 2018. But the state’s measles dashboard also shows two cases, one in January and one in February. A state health department spokesperson said those cases were “retrospectively identified” and part of the current outbreak. The eight other cases were recorded this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly said during a health conference in Wichita that state officials are closely monitoring the outbreak and are ensuring infected people are isolated. She also urged Kansans to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They are safe and effective,” Kelly said. “I have two kids. They were both vaccinated. They are alive and well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classify a measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; as three or more cases linked to each other. This makes Kansas one of the most recent states with a measles outbreak. &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;Texas has the largest outbreak&lt;/a&gt;, with more than 300 cases of the measles. Health experts say the disease can lead to serious complications, hospitalization or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC has confirmed one death amid the outbreak in Texas. In New Mexico, health officials are investigating the cause of death for a person who tested positive for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ongoing spread of the illness in Kansas comes as state lawmakers in Topeka are considering a bill that includes loosening vaccine requirements in child care regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill is aimed at reducing specific fees and training requirements for early child care facilities. But a provision expands religious exemptions for vaccines that are required for child care programs. The Kansas House recently approved the bill with bipartisan support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kansas vaccine advocates argue the requirement changes could reduce vaccine rates amid a growing public health issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more unvaccinated children you have in a setting, the more likely it is that measles or whatever will go through the population,” said Rabbi Moti Rieber, executive director for Kansas Interfaith Action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="py-8"&gt;&lt;img class="mx-auto w-full sm:w-full md:w-full" src="https://media.eaglewebservices.com/public/2025/3/1743085804155.png" alt="A photo of measles, mumps and rubella vaccines.&amp;amp;nbsp;Photo by Celia Llopis Jepsen/Kansas News Service.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="text-center italic text-gray-700 text-sm pt-2"&gt;A photo of measles, mumps and rubella vaccines. Photo by Celia Llopis Jepsen/Kansas News Service.png&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is measles?&amp;amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles, also known as rubeola, is a highly contagious infection caused by a virus. It spreads through the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dana Hawkinson, medical director of infection and prevention at the University of Kansas Health System, said the illness can linger in the air for up to two hours. He said he expects to see the number of cases in Kansas rise because of how easy measles spreads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the decrease in overall vaccine rates, I think we have to expect there to be more cases,” he said, “Just because the less people vaccinated means more people that are susceptible to the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson said measles can potentially cause severe health problems, like pneumonia. In rare cases, it can lead to brain damage and deafness. He said one in five people who contract measles are hospitalized and it can be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This can be a very devastating disease,” Hawinkson said. “It is unfortunate because we know we have the best proactive safety measure, and that is the vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials say nine of the 10 Kansans who tested positive for measles were unvaccinated, and one was under vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson said measles symptoms typically start like a common cold. An infected person may have a fever, sore throat, runny nose and mild cough. About two to three days later, the person may develop white &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/measles/symptoms-causes/syc-20374857" target="_blank"&gt;spots in their mouth, known as Koplik spots&lt;/a&gt;. About three to five days later, the person will develop &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/photos.html" target="_blank"&gt;a red, splotchy rash&lt;/a&gt;, which Hawksinson said usually starts on a person’s head and face and then spreads downward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/measles-keeping-family-safe.html" target="_blank"&gt;Experts say if you suspect you or your child has measles&lt;/a&gt;, it’s best for them to stay home away from other people. Hawkinson said it’s also important to call ahead before bringing someone with a possible infection to the doctor, emergency room or urgent care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is really best to call ahead so that they can take those preparations into account, so that they can protect other people in those areas,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state health department website has more information about &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/1501/Measles-Rubeola#:~:text=Providers%20%26%20LHD%20Resources%20Table%20Section,not%20wait%20for%20test%20results." target="_blank"&gt;measles and what to watch for.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Measles prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson encourages full vaccination against measles as the best way to avoid contracting the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a vaccine that has been used for five to six decades,” Hawkinson said. “It has a great history of safety. It has a great history of effectiveness at preventing disease and especially the complications of disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html" target="_blank"&gt;There are two types of vaccines for measles&lt;/a&gt;: MMR and MMRV. Children need two doses of either vaccine to be fully protected against measles. The first dose should be administered when a child is between 12 and 15 months old and the second should be when a child is between four and six years old. However, the MMVR second dose can be administered as early as 3 months after the first dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson said now is a good time to check you and your family’s vaccination status. He said unvaccinated children and adults or people who didn’t receive both doses of the vaccine should consider getting them now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="py-8"&gt;&lt;img class="mx-auto w-full sm:w-full md:w-full" src="https://media.eaglewebservices.com/public/2025/3/1743086270322.jpeg" alt="Photo by Pixabay"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="text-center italic text-gray-700 text-sm pt-2"&gt;Photo by Pixabay&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccine rates and recent legislation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the public to be safe from the measles, about 95% of the community needs to be vaccinated against the disease, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#:~:text=Why%20is%20there%20more%20measles,returning%20to%20the%20United%20States." target="_blank"&gt;the CDC says&lt;/a&gt;. About 90% of Kansans are vaccinated for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, state lawmakers have challenged vaccine requirements in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kansas House recently approved a &lt;a href="https://www.kslegislature.gov/li/b2025_26/measures/hb2294/?link_id=1&amp;amp;can_id=ddf8202ea341214def057893c988d994&amp;amp;source=email-action-alert-tell-your-house-member-to-protect-the-kansas-supreme-court&amp;amp;email_referrer=email_2662630&amp;amp;email_subject=action-alert-on-childhood-immunizations&amp;amp;&amp;amp;" target="_blank"&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; aimed at reducing or eliminating fees and training requirements for child care facilities. That bill includes a provision that adds moral and ethical opposition to the definition of religious exemptions for vaccines that children are required to get before attending child care programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rieber said the change is reckless. He said most major religions approve of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In anti-vax sentiment, sometimes it’s called 'religious' but actually, it is more about people’s fears,” Rieber said. “There’s not really a religious basis for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rieber said changing the definition of religious exemption for vaccine requirements at childcare facilities could also open the door to changes for K-12 public schools, which require several other vaccines for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rieber said he supports expanding access to affordable child care in Kansas, but the amendment could harm vaccinated and unvaccinated kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biggest issue is the potential for this to be a precedent that would then take away the ability of the school or the facility to actually protect their children by not allowing unvaccinated children to be in the setting,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers on the House floor did not discuss the details of the bill or the reasons to include the vaccine exemption changes before voting to approve it. The bill is now in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hays Post</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 13:02:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBQUTY4Y20ybVRiVXRLbkUwMmVodFdWMUNMQ0N6TnhYYXNHMmhaaHdydDlDNTRjNVNOd0YwN2l5WC1NVUZmWllsNW1QVlVZNW5wR1ZramZTOWNyMUFFdERJQWVKZmxJQnhiSmQ3OUx1Mmk</guid></item><item><title>Artificial sweetener sucralose confuses brain and increases hunger, study says - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxPMC1EYmtRWU92ZXJyeENSMGpBRFVzZDQ0YkpXOGgtdWtWZVZUOG5HaTd2UGVma0ZMaThnUFNvSEp5ZGFKWkwwTk1DTlhLX0w2U3llMmdRRC1rLU9UbWxFREE5dDJnb2RleUJ2d3RyRWZmZWhfQ1ZIbzlOd2Fld18wV3dENlNJb3gxTEFxeHotWFpBWmRuV3BQZHFQXzVDcllhbW9MTElR0gGcAUFVX3lxTE1Fc1JiV1RNYUtIV3NvMGx0bkxHSjZET3dmTmtMXzJwM1FaUVE1SlFtdkJIZmUwd05tLVlzUHZoTjEzeTUxN3VhMDdLSmkyLXdFellxTzdzdC1SeG5xQUlTU2pXcl9pTEE0VGxwaV94N3lEM0d4WkJaMEtBTXNvS09VUEpsNzJONkVZRTRSM2lOc1NIMDlRVmV0RFk4bw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            A growing body of evidence has increasingly linked diet sodas and other no- or low-calorie foods with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/health/video/zero-calorie-sweetener-weight-gain-sanjay-gupta-digvid"&gt;weight gain&lt;/a&gt; — so much so that the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/15/health/who-sweeteners-weigh-loss-guideline-wellness/index.html"&gt;issued an advisory&lt;/a&gt; in May 2023 saying not to use sugar substitutes for weight loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000d3b6m7q0gyjt9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Replacing free sugars with non-sugar sweeteners does not help people control their weight long-term,” Dr. Francesco Branca, director of WHO’s department of nutrition and food safety, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/23/health/artificial-sweetener-reduction-wellness"&gt;said at the time&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000f3b6md97rbbyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, a new study may shed light on why consuming too much of the artificial sweetener sucralose could be counterproductive. Instead of the brain sending a signal to eat less, sucralose triggers an increase in appetite when consumed in a drink.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000g3b6mpjv9j5k5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sucralose activates the area in the brain that regulates hunger, and that activation, in turn, is linked to greater ratings of hunger,” said lead study author Dr. Katie Page, an associate professor of medicine and pediatrics and director of the Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine in Los Angeles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000h3b6mzk2mdcbj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In fact, people who drank water with sucralose said their appetite increased by nearly 20% compared with drinking water with table sugar, Page said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000i3b6mv5lex0th@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the United States, sucralose is a key ingredient in some Splenda sugar substitutes.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In Europe, &lt;a href="https://www.kraftchemical.com/product/sucralose/" target="_blank"&gt;sucralose is known as E955&lt;/a&gt; and is found in sugar substitutes sold under the brand names Candys, Canderel Yellow, Cukren, Nevella, Splenda, SucraPlus, Sukrana and Zerocal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000j3b6m7xd0tliz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study only investigated the impact of sucralose and did not research other popular artificials sweeteners such as &lt;a href="https://www.kraftchemical.com/product/aspartame/" target="_blank"&gt;aspartame&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.kraftchemical.com/product/acesulfame-k/" target="_blank"&gt;acesulfame-K&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.kraftchemical.com/product/sodium-saccharin/" target="_blank"&gt;sodium saccharin&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “This is a very high quality study, using state of the art methods and careful analysis,” said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine, via email. Katz, founder of the nonprofit &lt;a href="https://www.truehealthinitiative.org/" target="_blank"&gt;True Health Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine, was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000l3b6msgx0rmv5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The authors interpreted their results carefully yet make a strong case that “non-caloric sweeteners, and sucralose specifically, interfere with normal appetite regulation in ways that could have adverse effects on weight control and health,” Katz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000m3b6mnamo4nj6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A spokesperson for Heartland Food Products Group, which manufactures Splenda, said that low-calorie and zero-calorie sweeteners are backed by research and expert recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8taooq900043b6m6173swe4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Low- or zero-calorie sweeteners like sucralose are recommended by healthcare professionals, food safety experts and credible health organizations for diabetes and weight management based on trusted scientific research showing that the impact of low- or zero-calorie sweeteners on body weight is similar to that of water, and that sweet-tasting products have decreased the want for additional sweets while also helping people manage weight, reduce intake of calories from added sugars, and manage blood sugar levels,” the spokesperson wrote via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000o3b6mt2yjecmu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The idea that artificial sweeteners may be increasing hunger signals from the mammalian brain isn’t new — a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784545?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=092821" target="_blank"&gt;prior study&lt;/a&gt; coauthored by Page  found women and people with obesity were especially sensitive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000p3b6mw322oruy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Animal studies have hinted at some of these effects,” Katz said. However, “this is, to my knowledge, the most decisive study to date in humans of direct effects on the appetite center.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000q3b6mvo3wc56e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All cells in the body require glucose for energy. The brain is the biggest user, gobbling up to &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news-events/publications-archive/brain/sugar-brain" target="_blank"&gt;half of all sugars&lt;/a&gt; circulating in the blood. Nature, however,  designed the brain to respond to natural sugars such as glucose found in whole fruits and some vegetables.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000r3b6mwpjda4uj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Artificial sweeteners, therefore, appear to confuse the brain, Page said, by sending signals of sweetness without delivering the needed calories the brain requires. Scientists have hypothesized that when those promised calories don’t arrive, the brain may send out a signal to eat more.

            The new study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-025-01227-8" target="_blank"&gt;published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Nature Metabolism, asked 75 people to consume one of three drinks on three separate occasions: plain water, water sweetened with table sugar (sucrose), and water sweetened with sucralose.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000t3b6m1yl5quh2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During each visit, the research team tested participants’ fasting blood sugar levels, followed by a brain scan called Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or fMRI, which tracks blood flow to capture activity in different regions of the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000u3b6mg7bi0qx1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They came out of the scanner and consumed one of the three drinks, and went back into the scanner,” Page said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000v3b6mh1tlp2ke@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One glass contained 300 milliliters of water and 75 grams (about 2.5 ounces) of sugar (sucrose), which is the equivalent of a 16-ounce can of sugary soda, Page said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000w3b6mndvnxqp2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another drink contained enough sucralose to match that sweetness. Sucralose is about &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/aspartame-and-other-sweeteners-food#:~:text=Sucralose%20is%20sold%20under%20the,under%20certain%20conditions%20of%20use." target="_blank"&gt;600 times sweeter than sugar&lt;/a&gt;, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. The third drink was plain water, which served as a control.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000x3b6m3h8dwyes@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During the brain scanning, Page and her team did another round of blood sampling at 10 minutes, 35 minutes and 120 minutes after consuming the drink and asked participants to rate their hunger level.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000y3b6m3stwgnre@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “(The study) is particularly strong because it used repeated measures within the same participants and included different methods such as brain imaging, blood draws, and subjective ratings to test their hypothesis,” said Kyle Burger, a scientist at the nonprofit Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, which investigates human senses of taste and smell. Burger was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000z3b6muet2vijq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition to finding that drinks with sucralose increased the sensation of hunger by about 17%, Page and her team found increased connections to other parts of the brain responsible for controlling motivation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00103b6m6own09nl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sucralose appears to affect your decision-making skills,” Page said. “For example, we found increased brain connectivity between the hypothalamus and the anterior cingulate cortex, which controls the risks and rewards of a decision.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00113b6mvhtamvd9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, blood tests showed sucralose had no effect on hormones the brain uses to tell when we are satisfied and no longer hungry, Page said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00123b6m293hhjj6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s no signal, no signal at all,” she said. “There’s a sweetness signal, but there’s no hormone signal telling you you’re full. Sucralose doesn’t have an effect on those hormones.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00133b6moqaw01g5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not everyone, however, may feel the combined effects of sucralose in the same way, Katz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00143b6meg4td4fb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those with insulin resistance, for instance, may be especially prone to disruption of normal appetite control with sucralose,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00153b6m3g8hwie2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recommendations on how to manage the body’s reactions to artificial sweeteners are currently complex, Page said. For example, the American Diabetes Association tells people with insulin resistance and diabetes to &lt;a href="https://professional.diabetes.org/sites/dpro/files/2023-12/sugar_substitutes.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;use no-calorie drinks and foods&lt;/a&gt;, but sparingly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00163b6mbkjgorub@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m an endocrinologist so I see patients for diabetes and obesity,” Page said. “I would never say drink or eat more sugar.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00173b6m0u3z10bh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Instead, I tell my patients to not rely on non-caloric sweeteners as a substitute for sugar and try to reduce the overall intake of dietary sweeteners in general,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00183b6mmh4l1kbv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Katz agreed, preferring to suggest a form of &lt;a href="https://hartfordhealthcare.org/file%20library/services/pdfs/hvi-lifestyle-taste-bud-rehab-3-pager-hartford-healthcare.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;taste bud “rehab&lt;/a&gt;” that can reduce overall use of sugars, no matter what their form.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00193b6m4lorqw8t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A truly wholesome diet has little added sugar in the first place, and thus no sugar to ‘replace’ with sucralose and related compounds,” Katz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir001a3b6msfhv72ya@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Just as many people have cut their use of salt, it’s possible to cut your use of sweeteners by teaching taste buds to desire fewer sweets, he said. Taste buds will respond by finding sugary foods that used to be delicious now cloyingly sweet, or in the case of sodium, much too salty, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4500487/#:~:text=In%20summer%202014%2C%2020%20people,use%20less%20or%20even%20no" target="_blank"&gt;research has shown&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir001b3b6mjmytvsiv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Start out by finding hidden sources of sugar in foods you may not realize are sweetened, Katz told CNN in a prior interview.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir001c3b6m9bqu0w9m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If I asked you to boycott all the desserts in your life, you would probably rebel or fail,” Katz said. “But there is a massive amount of added sugar and sweeteners hiding in foods that are not sweet — in salad dressing, pasta sauce, bread, crackers, even salty chips.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir001d3b6mi2hdkx8p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By choosing products without sweeteners, he said, it’s possible to reduce a person’s daily intake of sugar or sweeteners “by a third, maybe even a half as many grams a day before we even lay a hand on anything that you actually expect to be sweet.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

This means that improving one’s overall diet to enhance insulin sensitivity is a key way to get rid of this stubborn type of fat. “To do this, you want to focus on reducing added sugars and refined carbs in the diet and replacing them with higher fiber alternatives,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As part of changing your diet to encourage belly fat loss, there are four foods and drinks the nutrition experts recommend avoiding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/16-ways-lose-weight-quickly-204124695.html" data-ylk="slk:Want to Lose Weight?

Sugary drinks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you want to lose belly fat, both nutrition experts say cutting out sugary drinks will help big time. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35064240/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scientific research shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Scientific research shows&lt;/a&gt; that these drinks (such as soda, sweetened iced tea, fruit drinks, energy drinks and flavored coffee drinks) are linked to weight gain and increase the risk of &lt;a href="https://parade.com/tag/diabetes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. “Sugary drinks spike blood sugar and lead to fat storage, especially around the belly. Plus, they don’t provide satiety, making it easy to overconsume calories,” Graca says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Palinksi-Wade adds to this, saying that sugar-sweetened drinks provide one of the biggest sources of added sugar in the diet with little to no nutritional value. “These can cause a spike in blood sugar and insulin levels while providing little satiety, meaning that you’ll feel just as hungry as you did before drinking the beverage, even though it may contain more calories than a meal itself,” she concurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/ditching-food-could-lead-8-160000027.html" data-ylk="slk:Ditching This Food Could Lead to 8 Pounds of Weight Loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Ditching This Food Could Lead to 8 Pounds of Weight Loss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;2. Refined carbohydrates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Graca says that something else to consume minimally if at all if you want to lose belly fat is refined carbs, which includes foods like white bread, pastries and chips. “Refined carbs digest quickly, causing energy crashes and increasing hunger soon after eating. They also contribute to inflammation, which can be linked to excess belly fat,” she says. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10523278/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scientific research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Scientific research&lt;/a&gt; backs up this connection, showing that a diet high in refined carbohydrates is linked to weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;3. Fried foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another type of food Graca says can sabotage weight loss is fried food. “Fried foods are often high in unhealthy fats and calories, making it easier to consume more than your body needs while increasing the risk of metabolic issues,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Instead of having a diet that includes refined carbohydrates and fried food, Graca recommends prioritizing protein, fiber and healthy fats, which support weight loss while keeping the body energized and satiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/13-reasons-why-aren-t-171821135.html" data-ylk="slk:13 Reasons Why You Aren't Losing Weight—Plus, Expert-Backed Tips on What to Do About It;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;13 Reasons Why You Aren't Losing Weight—Plus, Expert-Backed Tips on What to Do About It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;4. Alcohol&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Regularly consuming alcohol can make losing belly fat harder. “&lt;a href="https://parade.com/tag/alcohol" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alcohol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Alcohol&lt;/a&gt; can provide a source of empty calories and added sugar. In addition, it can disrupt &lt;a href="https://parade.com/tag/sleep" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;, which can accelerate gains in belly fat,” Palinski-Wade warns. She adds that consuming alcohol in excess can increase inflammation while draining energy, resulting in less overall physical activity the next day, which makes it harder to lose belly fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The fact that alcohol can disrupt sleep is especially noteworthy. “A lack of quality rest can increase insulin resistance and stress hormones, both of which can increase belly fat,” Palinksi-Wade says.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alopecia is an autoimmune disorder that causes non-scarring hair loss on the scalp and body that is experienced by almost &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5573125/" target="_blank"&gt;2% of the global population&lt;/a&gt; at some point in their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;A team of researchers from Australia, Singapore, and China discovered that activated hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs), crucial for hair regrowth and repair, require a powerful protector protein called MCL-1 to function successfully. Without MCL-1, these cells undergo stress and eventually die, leading to hair loss, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58150-5" target="_blank"&gt;as reported in&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt; study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hair follicles are small tunnel-like structures in the skin where hair grows. These follicles repeatedly cycle through three &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/distinct+phases/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;distinct phases&lt;/a&gt;: anagen, the active growth phase; catagen, a transitional phase marked by slowed growth and follicle shrinkage; and telogen, a resting phase where growth ceases and shedding occurs, after which the cycle begins afresh, driven by HFSCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research shows that when HFSCs experience stress from hair shaft loss or follicle shrinkage, they can undergo apoptosis—a controlled way for cells to die— which furthers hair loss. This apoptotic process is controlled by a group of proteins called the BCL-2 family, which decides whether a cell should survive or die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is known that MCL-1, which is part of the BCL-2 family, belongs to the pro-survival protein group, its role in HFSC regulation and hair regeneration is a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate MCL-1's influence on HFSC regulation, the researchers of this study deleted the MCL-1 gene from mice skin cells and removed certain patches of existing hair. They found that lack of MCL-1 from birth did not impact the formation of hair follicles but led to gradual hair loss from declining HFSCs over time.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;In adult mice, MCL-1 deletion quickly destroyed active HFSCs, which completely stopped hair regeneration in the patches where hair was removed.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inactive HFSCs remained intact even after MCL-1 deletion, but once they woke up and started dividing to grow new hair, they experienced stress, which triggered the P53 protein essential for regulating &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cell+death/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cell death&lt;/a&gt;. However, deletion of a P53 gene restored hair growth even in the absence of MCL-1, suggesting collaboration between MCL-1 and P53 in maintaining a balance between &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cell+survival/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cell survival&lt;/a&gt; and death in hair follicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mice model experiments also revealed that the ERBB signaling pathway (controls cellular processes) plays a key role in keeping active hair follicle stem cells alive by increasing the production of MCL-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deeper knowledge of molecular pathways and interactions that regulate hair &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/follicle/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;follicle&lt;/a&gt; growth and cell death paves the way for innovative strategies for treating alopecia and preventing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hair+loss/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hair loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers who conducted this study used four epigenetic clocks to get a range of measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The good news is that we know today that only a small part (10 to 30%) of the variability of health span is explained by our genes,” says Bischoff-Ferrari. “The rest is determined by our environment, socioeconomic factors and especially lifestyle, such as exercise and diet.” &lt;strong&gt;Bischoff-Ferrari and her colleagues used epigenetic clocks to measure the biological ages of people who took 1 gram of an algae-based omega-3 supplement daily, 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily and/or participated in a strength-training exercise program for 30 minutes three times per week.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who took the omega-3 supplement every day for three years had a biological age that was an average of 3 months younger than their chronological age, according to three of the four epigenetic clocks. The fourth clock showed “there was an additional benefit if omega-3 was combined with vitamin D and exercise,”&lt;/strong&gt; says Bischoff-Ferrari. Three months may not sound like much, but Bischoff-Ferrari says it’s enough to have an impact at the population level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one knows exactly why omega-3 fatty acids could have such a strong effect on the aging process, but there are plenty of hypotheses. “Notably, these results complement previous clinical findings in the same trial (DO-HEALTH), which found that omega-3 lowered the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522002544#bib19" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rate of falls by 10%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;rate of falls by 10%&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2772758" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduced the rate of infections by up to 13%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reduced the rate of infections by up to 13%&lt;/a&gt;, while omega-3, vitamin D and exercise combined &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2260134124000975" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lowered the risk of pre-frailty by 39%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lowered the risk of pre-frailty by 39%&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aging/articles/10.3389/fragi.2022.852643/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:invasive cancer by 61%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;invasive cancer by 61%&lt;/a&gt;,” says Bischoff-Ferrari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems as though omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D and exercise could provide a triple-whammy of aging protection. “It is well-documented in basic science that vitamin D prevents uncontrolled cell growth and has anti-inflammatory benefits,” says Bischoff-Ferrari. Meanwhile, exercise is famous for being “a major driver of healthy longevity with protective effects on most age-related chronic diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, osteoporosis and diabetes,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study shows how powerful small lifestyle changes (such as taking a supplement or starting a new exercise regimen) can be when it comes to protecting our health and slowing down the aging process of our cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;fcafotodigital - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the best sources of omega-3 fatty acids?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As important as they are for our health and longevity, omega-3 fatty acids aren’t easily created in our bodies, so we need to source them from food and supplements. &lt;strong&gt;Foods rich in omega-3s include fatty fish (such as salmon), nuts (like walnuts), seeds (chia seeds, for instance), plant oils (like soybean oil and fortified foods (such as some eggs, yogurt and drinks). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three main types of omega-3 fatty acids — ALA, DHA and EPA. There are no &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-Consumer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:set recommendations;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;set recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for the amount of DHA and EPA you should consume, but males age 14 and older should aim for 1.6 grams of ALA every day, while the goal is 1.1 daily grams of ALA for females age 14 and older. People breastfeeding should get 1.3 grams of ALA every day and those who are pregnant should aim for 1.4 grams of ALA. &lt;strong&gt;If you’re not getting enough from your diet, you may want to ask your doctor about taking an omega-3 supplement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ultimate Omega&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000HDV7YS?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10055.a.64303162%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$23.98 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$23.98 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Super Omega-3 Plus EPA/DHA Fish Oil&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JPD5ZJ4?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10055.a.64303162%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$33.44 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$33.44 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ultra Omega 3 from Fish Oil&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/hearstcorp_9eb67_ghk?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F3006986%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252F196155762%253Fselected%253Dtrue%26subId1%3Dghk%7C&amp;amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fdiet-nutrition%2Fa64303162%2Fstudy-omega3-fatty-acids-biolgical-age%2F&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo-us&amp;amp;utm_campaign=65&amp;amp;utm_medium=syn" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$16.88 at walmart.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$16.88 at walmart.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 12:38:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9IcUVtMWhEMk9JM2tkY3BLdTAtQVZfRTJKVHFrdE5DSzVoZ2pURzVqQzRLanAzTVE2WlNQWk13YUpyMUpQRHJ1cTRDVDFqQXJNSjd4NGZjZmNGRm9KTkFqdjZmR1ZrajdaZ3l6TUxsVFhfTzhrV2g0dGdVbXR3R0E</guid></item><item><title>A woman who lost 130 pounds shares 7 changes she wasn't expecting — from people being nicer to her to food tasting different - Business Insider</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxPaVB5a2ZUTjI3cEFYODRIOFd0NVNGVlVuZ1VYbndFb1ZJanprczEtbENKSm1zLV9wbVN3a2V5OVdSbFFiXzgxRjBBSzloNldhZWlNTm9kSmFYUDdMVDgxa09zWnhoNS0yY015S1FxdExMZGFmZVJ0X0xPVFF4Q3I5dEdiODlsYUVnWXUxczd3Qlg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="post-body-content post-story-body-content" data-component-type="post-body-content" data-load-strategy="exclude" data-track-content="" data-post-type="story"&gt;
            
              &lt;p&gt;On a family trip in 2022, &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@emmaromajayne" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;Emma Roma Jayne&lt;/a&gt; stayed in the car as everyone else went to the beach. The thought of being in shorts in public, and having the body she was so insecure about on display, made her feel viscerally uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roma Jayne, a TikTok creator and influencer partnership manager based in Australia, had always struggled with her weight. She tried to eat healthily, trying different diets and exercising "all the time," but she wasn't &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/718547/health-and-safety-by-emily-witt/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;losing weight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the beach trip, her mom told her enough was enough.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;
              
              
              
                
              
              &lt;span class="image-source-caption "&gt;
                    &lt;figcaption class="image-caption headline-semibold" data-e2e-name="image-caption"&gt;
                      Roma Jayne underwent bariatric weight loss surgery in 2023.

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;"She was like, 'This isn't right. You're 22. You should be enjoying your life and be able to go to the beach whenever you want and feel comfortable.' She suggested that I should get weight loss surgery like she had," Roma Jayne told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, in 2023, Roma Jayne had &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-bariatric-surgery" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;bariatric surgery&lt;/a&gt;, and her relationship with food and her body has been totally different since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At first, I was very much like, 'That's cheating. You need to put in the hard work to lose weight.' But I looked at weight loss surgery as a way that I could stop the food noise and then change my lifestyle, because I didn't want to spend the next 10 years still struggling with the same issues," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She lost around 110 pounds in the year after the surgery. Now 24,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;she's lost a further 22 pounds in the year since — and kept the weight off — having made huge &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-lost-75-pounds-making-2-simple-lifestyle-changes-2024-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;lifestyle changes&lt;/a&gt;; she now works out six times a week and eats a high-protein, low-carb, balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

                      Roma Jayne has lost 130lbs and kept it off through healthy lifestyle changes.

                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While bariatric surgery is becoming less common, per one recent study, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/weight-loss-glp-1-drugs-ozempic-wegovy-mounjaro-effects-future-2023-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;weight loss is booming&lt;/a&gt; as more people are prescribed drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight loss surgery "is the best decision I have ever made in my entire life," Roma Jayne said. "It has transformed my life completely."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the obvious, Roma Jayne has noticed seven unexpected &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/weight-loss-maintenance-lessons-learned-4-years-after-fat-muscle-2022-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;changes after her weight loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a2ebe439-9682-4fbc-a4e7-4b6bf254c926" data-toc-id="a2ebe439-9682-4fbc-a4e7-4b6bf254c926"&gt;People are more friendly&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no beating around the bush, I was definitely treated differently when I was bigger," Roma Jayne said. "People were just not as friendly, but they are so nice to me now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that people hold doors for her, greet her in the street, and strike up conversations with her now, whereas before she lost weight she felt "invisible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="b07c4b3f-6f25-4db5-b3ba-d56a8ed83705" data-toc-id="b07c4b3f-6f25-4db5-b3ba-d56a8ed83705"&gt;Her feet have gotten smaller&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the more random changes that I didn't even know that was a thing is that my feet shrunk," Roma Jayne said.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers suggested this could be because of fat loss on the foot, as well as the arches getting higher once there is less weight pushing them down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="0bc6c067-2204-4628-84a0-679039349911" data-toc-id="0bc6c067-2204-4628-84a0-679039349911"&gt;Her voice has changed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roma Jayne also said that her voice has gotten higher and sounds more clear since her surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's not much research on the impacts of weight loss on voice. A few small, limited studies have suggested that there could be minor changes to people's voices after bariatric surgery, but the differences aren't noticeable enough to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

According to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/acne/causes/diet" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;American Academy of Dermatology Association&lt;/a&gt;, eating high-glycemic foods that raise your blood sugar quickly — such as white bread, potato chips, pastries, and white rice — is associated with acne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roma Jayne also has PCOS, of which acne is a symptom. The UK's &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/treatment/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;National Health Service&lt;/a&gt; said that weight loss can improve &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/pcos-weight-loss-tips-why-it-can-be-harder-2022-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;symptoms of PCOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="c6fae2c2-442b-4aa8-8ac9-bcfdc42af8c6" data-toc-id="c6fae2c2-442b-4aa8-8ac9-bcfdc42af8c6"&gt;Her tastes have changed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roma Jayne used to hate avocados, and now loves them. She also used to eat a lot of fruit, but now eats far less fruit and far more vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10165840/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of research, published in the Nutrition Journal in 2023, found that across 26 studies, it seemed that weight gain and obesity could change people's perception of tastes, and increase their preferences for sweetness. However, the authors said that these results weren't conclusive and that more research needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

People swear by them – claiming everything from mental clarity to faster recovery. But what does science say when you strip away the hype?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers at the &lt;a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; has taken a closer look. Their work didn’t just explore how our bodies handle cold on the outside. It examined what happens on a much deeper level: inside your cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study could shape how we think about cold exposure and its place in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organ-aging-can-predict-diseases-decades-in-advance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;everyday health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cold-plunges-change-cells-in-one-week"&gt;Cold plunges change cells in one week&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;​The &lt;a href="https://hepru.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Human and Environmental Physiology Research Unit&lt;/a&gt; conducted a tightly controlled experiment with ten healthy young men.​&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over seven days, each participant immersed himself in 14°C (57.2°F) water for one hour per day. Blood samples were drawn before and after the cold-water sessions on days 1, 4, and 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim wasn’t to measure surface-level outcomes like muscle soreness. Instead, the team analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells to examine cellular stress, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-discover-a-protein-that-reverses-cellular-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recovery&lt;/a&gt;, and resilience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They focused on autophagy (the body’s way of cleaning out damaged components) and apoptosis (programmed cell death).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings indicate that repeated cold exposure significantly improves autophagic function, a critical cellular protective mechanism,” said Professor Kenny. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This enhancement allows cells to better manage stress and could have important implications for health and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/defying-time-three-ways-to-slow-biological-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-cold-plunges-caused-stress"&gt;Early cold plunges caused stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the first day, the researchers found clear signs of stress. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/random-dna-mutations-shape-biological-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cells&lt;/a&gt; showed an increase in proteins like p62, which typically accumulate when autophagy is disrupted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LC3-II, a marker of autophagic activity, did not increase. Apoptotic signaling also rose, with a marked spike in cleaved caspase-3, a protein that signals a cell is on its way to self-destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meant that initially, the cold exposure was overwhelming the cells. The natural repair systems weren’t strong enough to counteract the damage. But that would begin to change by day four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signals-of-cellular-recovery"&gt;Signals of cellular recovery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the fourth day of immersion, early signs of adaptation emerged. LC3-II levels began to climb slightly, and p62 dropped – although still above baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, caspase-3 remained high, indicating the cells were still battling stress. The balance had not yet tipped in favor of full recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By the end of the acclimation, we noted a marked improvement in the participants’ cellular cold tolerance. This suggests that cold acclimation may help the body effectively cope with extreme environmental conditions,” explained King, the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day seven marked a significant change. LC3-II rose substantially, showing robust autophagic activity. p62 dropped below baseline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caspase-3 levels returned to near normal. The cells had started to regulate themselves more efficiently, showing they had adapted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cellular-learning-confirmed"&gt;Cellular learning confirmed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To take it further, the researchers tested the participants’ blood cells in cold conditions outside the body – before and after the week-long immersion routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known as ex vivo testing, this allowed the team to simulate hypothermic states (temperatures as low as 4°C) without endangering the volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before acclimation, these tests revealed poor autophagic responses and increased &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/can-we-reverse-aging-a-bold-new-approach-could-reprogram-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;apoptosis&lt;/a&gt; across all cold conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after the seven-day program, LC3-II increased significantly at every temperature below 35°C. Apoptotic signals, particularly cleaved caspase-3, decreased, while p62 remained lower across the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These shifts showed that cells had become better at handling cold stress, even when removed from the body. It wasn’t just temporary resistance – it was programmed cellular behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cold-plunges-triggered-stress-proteins"&gt;Cold plunges triggered stress proteins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While tracking autophagy and apoptosis, the researchers also looked at heat shock proteins – namely HSP70 and HSP90. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These proteins help stabilize other proteins during stress. Both increased during cold immersion but did not change significantly across the seven days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that the cold exposure was enough to activate them, but the level of stimulus did not escalate throughout the week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, it’s possible the body tuned its internal systems to respond more efficiently without ramping up these proteins further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work underscores the importance of acclimation protocols in enhancing human health, especially in contexts where individuals are exposed to extreme temperatures,” noted Professor Kenny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cooling-curve-and-shivering-clues"&gt;Cooling curve and shivering clues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides cellular markers, physiological changes supported the idea of adaptation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By day seven, participants had smaller increases in blood lactate levels – indicating less shivering. The body was becoming more efficient at conserving heat without relying on rapid muscle contractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooling rates slowed too. Participants took longer to reach the cutoff esophageal temperature of 35.5°C. While core temperature didn’t differ much across days, these smaller indicators confirmed the shift in cold tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-life-and-death-inside-a-cell"&gt;Life and death inside a cell&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, at colder temperatures (33°C and below), both autophagic and apoptotic signals rose post-acclimation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dual response could mean cells were trying to survive using every tool available. When stress surpassed a certain threshold, even enhanced autophagy wasn’t enough to prevent some cells from progressing toward death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mirrors findings in animal models, where excessive autophagy can trigger cell death if damage is too severe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeaway? Cold adaptation boosts protection, but it’s not a magic shield against extreme stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cold-plunges-may-slow-cellular-aging"&gt;Cold plunges may slow cellular aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were amazed to see how quickly the body adapted,” said King. “Cold exposure might help prevent diseases and potentially even slow down aging at a cellular level. It’s like a tune-up for your body’s microscopic machinery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this research focused on healthy young males, it opens a door for broader inquiry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could older adults benefit from structured cold exposure? What about people with chronic illnesses that impair autophagic function? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are next steps scientists are eager to explore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cold-exposure-as-health-practice"&gt;Cold exposure as health practice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study presents a strong case for integrating safe, structured cold exposure into wellness routines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven days of one-hour immersion changed how cells handled stress, repaired themselves, and avoided damage. It’s one of the first studies to show these changes at a molecular level in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research will help define guidelines: how cold, how long, and how often. But one thing is clear – the body learns. And when exposed with care, cold might not be something to avoid, but something to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re an athlete or just someone curious about longevity, this research suggests that the answer might be hiding in plain sight – or maybe, in a tub of ice water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adbi.202400111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Advanced Biology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 12:09:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxQMTMzWWNvY0Y1Z1duZ1Y1S3NuZkZjNWtlWXZaQ1RsTDJ3TjlYVGx4N1hXVUlVVk5ERGdPMzQ0OEtDZzI0SXFvY1BYb2ZIYk1maEJ5d1FYZzRQMzdGV2Q2N1RYamVmNzg0aFBnTHpsZ3R1RzJzNkh4SDJndC02cW95LW9Uc3pLbzhfQ0UtVzVINA</guid></item><item><title>A 30-Year Study May Have Found The Single Best Diet For Healthy Aging - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxOLWgxQm50Y1JfanZxQmFaQm9HbkZxaUFMbmo1S2drekxERE9STFBURGZwbU9YU1hOZkVFd09uSEc0dm1FOW9URUNCd1FzWVNpV0NpM3NPaGRpU0pnbzJiUGdIdnR3ZVVyNW5sY3VwWXNIcGJlNFdTNWhZMDg4T1VmRm1YZjRCS29hREN5eEFicm8yTnY1WS1lUko0NnM2akk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Would you add a few more vegetables and whole grains to your diet in return &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/protecting-your-muscle-mass-is-vital-for-healthy-aging-heres-why"&gt;for a healthy old age&lt;/a&gt;? A new study has broken down in detail the food groups that increase the likelihood of healthy aging – and identified the best diet overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of the study, researchers led by a team from Harvard University defined healthy aging as reaching 70 without any chronic diseases – and still being &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-sign-of-dementia-risk-may-be-keeping-you-up-at-night"&gt;in good shape mentally&lt;/a&gt; and physically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed that the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) came top of eight &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-should-eat-more-of-these-8-healthy-foods-and-heres-why"&gt;healthy dietary patterns&lt;/a&gt; studied: &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/scoring-highly-on-alternative-healthy-eating-index-lowers-risk-for-many-illnesses-202202082681"&gt;developed by Harvard&lt;/a&gt;, the AHEI prioritizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, and healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diet also keeps red and processed meats, sugary drinks, and salt down to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156605" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156605" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DietChart.jpg" alt="Diet chart" class="wp-image-156605 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DietChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DietChart-509x415.jpg 509w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DietChart-600x489.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156605" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;All the dietary guidelines studied improved the likelihood of healthy aging. (Tessier et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings also show that there is no one-size-fits-all diet," &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/healthy-eating-in-midlife-linked-to-overall-healthy-aging/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Anne-Julie Tessier, a professor of nutrition from the University of Montreal in Canada. "Healthy diets can be adapted to fit individual needs and preferences."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers tracked the eating habits of 105,015 people across the course of 30 years, cross-referencing how their diets matched up with the eight sets of healthy eating guidelines – and then checking health at 70 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, sticking closely to any of the diet plans improved the chances of aging healthily, and there was a lot of crossover in terms of the healthy eating recommendations: fruits, vegetables, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_grain"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt;, and unsaturated fats were frequently mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 9,771 people met the health criteria at 70, with the AHEI showing the most benefits. The participants who ranked in the top fifth in terms of AHEI adherence were 86 percent more likely to be healthy at 70 than those in the lowest fifth. It seems &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-mediterranean-lifestyle-really-can-help-you-live-longer-study-shows"&gt;the widely praised Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; may have some competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Studies have previously investigated dietary patterns in the context of specific diseases or how long people live," &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/healthy-eating-in-midlife-linked-to-overall-healthy-aging/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Frank Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology from Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ours takes a multifaceted view, asking, how does diet impact people's ability to live independently and enjoy a good quality of life as they age?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associations between diet and good health have been demonstrated in countless studies – whether you want to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-can-add-10-years-to-your-life-simply-by-changing-your-diet-massive-study-finds"&gt;add years to your life&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-japanese-diet-is-linked-to-less-brain-shinkage-in-women-experts-say"&gt;keep your brain ticking over&lt;/a&gt; – and while this new research doesn't show direct cause and effect, the link is strong enough to give us useful extra evidence for the benefits of eating well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Since staying active and independent is a priority for both individuals and public health, research on healthy aging is essential," &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/healthy-eating-in-midlife-linked-to-overall-healthy-aging/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Marta Guasch-Ferré, a professor of epidemiology from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that dietary patterns rich in plant-based foods, with moderate inclusion of healthy animal-based foods, may promote overall healthy aging and help shape future dietary guidelines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03570-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Yvonne Vávra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mayor of New York City refuses to walk in a straight line, loves hanging out in front of Zabar’s hoping to snag a bagel, and enjoys bossing around dogs — but only the large white ones, because he thinks they’re sheep. There. The truth is out. He also loves jumping into freshly made beds and messing them up. But that’s all just because he’s a dog. Simon of Riverside Drive is the official Dog Mayor of New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met Simon this week and was shocked to learn not only that we had a Dog Mayor, but that he’s a fellow Upper West Sider! The seven-year-old basset hound-cattle dog mix was sworn in just two months ago on the steps of City Hall, becoming only the second Dog Mayor in the city’s history. He succeeded basset hound Sally Long Dog of the East Village, who had served for two years. In front of some of the city’s most prominent human elected officials, Simon pledged to “uphold the office of New York City Dog Mayor with liberty — and yes, dognity — for all,” before shaking paws with Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, who administered the Oaf of Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_92536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-92536" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-92536 size-full" src="https://www.westsiderag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/79DE0DEF-E6A3-4545-99CF-ECEDA67E5F14-e1743105642230.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.westsiderag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/79DE0DEF-E6A3-4545-99CF-ECEDA67E5F14-e1743105642230.jpeg 640w, https://www.westsiderag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/79DE0DEF-E6A3-4545-99CF-ECEDA67E5F14-e1743105642230-300x149.jpeg 300w, https://www.westsiderag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/79DE0DEF-E6A3-4545-99CF-ECEDA67E5F14-e1743105642230-360x180.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-92536" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Photograph courtesy of Sophie.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Honorary New York City Dog Mayor Election was founded by media producer and dog lover Stephen Calabria as a way to bring joy and foster community during challenging times. With many people feeling overwhelmed, disillusioned, and tangled in the chaos of national politics, electing a Dog Mayor seems like an initiative pawsitively everyone can get behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s much more than a happy escape. A Dog Mayor may not know how to come up with plans or proposals to serve the greater good, nor how to mobilize people to step up. Not that many human politicians know, either. But dogs do, in fact, have qualities every good leader needs: They have the power to bring people together and foster a sense of belonging, which many of us crave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking the streets these days, I sometimes feel panic rising because everything seems so normal. People go about their business, sitting on benches, laughing, and eating ice cream. “We have no time for ice cream!” my brain screams. Please excuse it; it’s been screaming a lot, and it’s my fault. I’ve exposed it to too much news. Now it’s running wild, eyes wide and flailing: “The nerve of people to sit on benches in these times!” We should rather … uh … do something. But what? I don’t know. Anyone? The way I experience things is exactly what bad times need to stay bad: people feeling disconnected, scared, hopeless, and jaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, it’s absolutely crucial to eat ice cream. We need to enjoy life and each other’s company, gather, and find out if the people sitting on benches feel the same way. That’s how we gain the strength to create positive change. The power of connection can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And who can teach us how to foster these connections? Mayor Simon — representing all the canines of Gotham. Dogs show us that community-building doesn’t have to be complicated: Wag your way into shared moments of joy, be present, loyal, supportive, and always ready to lend a paw to anyone in need. Woof to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dogs don’t even need to do anything — their presence alone makes us stronger. There’s plenty of scientific evidence showing that dogs not only promote positive interactions between people, but also strengthen social trust and encourage helping behavior within communities. And, of course, they’re natural icebreakers. If you’ve ever walked with a dog, you know how many smiles and conversations come your way. Those small moments that acknowledge your presence instantly make you feel like you belong. You’re not just a passerby; you’re one of the crowd, part of the pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never met more people than I have since adopting Simon,” says Sophie, the Mayor’s mom. “We get stopped all the time, and I actually have close friends who I met because of Simon. I have so many interactions in a day — that’s my favorite part about the Upper West Side. We love it here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon may never pass a law or make a speech. But we should follow his lead. He ran on the slogan “Adopt a Brighter Future” and plans to use his term to champion animal rescue and adoption. Let’s adopt that mindset and rescue one another from facing these chaotic times alone. Short-legged Simon running the highest pawffice in the city reminds us that making a difference doesn’t always require big, bold steps. Sometimes, it’s simply about showing up with an open, loyal heart. The strength of our community lies not in how much we do, but how well we do it together — never forgetting to refuel along the way. Ice cream for everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

A moment in a crib, or the taste of a first birthday cake?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="300" data-end="534"&gt;Chances are, those memories aren’t real. Decades of research suggest that most people cannot recall personal experiences from the first few years of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="more-on"&gt;&lt;h2 class="more-on__heading"&gt;Recommended Stories &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list of 3 items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 1 of 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 2 of 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 3 of 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;end of list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-start="536" data-end="789"&gt;However, even though we can’t remember being a baby, a new study has found new evidence that babies do take in the world around them and may also begin forming memories far earlier than once thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-did-the-study-work-and-what-did-it-find"&gt;How did the study work and what did it find?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study published this month in Science by researchers at Yale and Columbia universities has revealed that babies as young as 12 months old can form memories via the hippocampus – a part of the brain that stores memories in adults, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To observe this, the researchers used a specially adapted brain scan for infants during a single session. It allowed them to watch how babies’ brains responded while they were awake and looking at images of faces and objects. Parents remained close to their babies, which helped keep them calm and alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, 26 infants aged four to 25 months were shown a series of images. It was found that if a baby’s hippocampus was more active the first time they saw a particular image, they would look at the same image for longer when it reappeared a short time later, next to a new one – suggesting they recognised it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that babies’ brains have the capacity for forming memories – but how long-lasting these memories are is still an open question,” said Tristan Yates, a postdoctoral research scientist in the department of psychology at Columbia University and lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time scientists have directly observed how a memory begins to take shape in an awake baby’s brain. Previous &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34022155/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; relied on indirect observations, such as watching whether babies reacted to something familiar. This time, however, researchers observed brain activity linked to specific memories as they form in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most past brain activity studies have been done while babies were asleep, which limited what researchers could learn about conscious memory-building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-does-this-tell-us-about-early-life-memories"&gt;What does this tell us about early life memories?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that episodic memory – the kind of memory that helps us remember specific events and the context in which they took place – begins to develop earlier than scientists previously believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, it was widely believed that this type of memory didn’t begin to form until well after a baby’s first birthday, typically around 18 to 24 months. Although the findings from the Science study were strongest in infants older than 12 months, the results were observed in much younger babies as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="so-at-what-age-do-we-start-making-memories"&gt;So, at what age do we start making memories?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now understood that babies begin forming limited types of memory when they are as young as two or three months. These include implicit memories (such as motor skills) and statistical learning, which helps infants detect patterns in language, faces and routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, episodic memory, which allows us to recall specific events as well as where and when they occurred, takes longer to develop and requires the maturation of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Cristina Maria Alberini, professor of neural science at New York University, the period in infancy when the hippocampus is developing its ability to form and store memories may be “critical”. This window could be important not only for memory but also has “great implications for mental health and memory or cognitive disorders”, she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memories formed in early childhood do not typically last very long, it is believed, which might explain why we can’t remember them later in life. In an ongoing study at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Germany, 20-month-old toddlers &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/are-your-earliest-childhood-memories-still-lurking-your-mind-or-gone-forever"&gt;were able to remember&lt;/a&gt; which toy was in which room for up to six months, while younger children retained the memory for only about one month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-can-t-we-remember-anything-from-infancy"&gt;Why can’t we remember anything from infancy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="0" data-end="465"&gt;Humans’ near-universal inability to recall personal experiences from before the age of about three is a phenomenon known as “infantile amnesia”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="0" data-end="465"&gt;For decades, scientists believed this happens simply because babies’ brains were too immature to store episodic memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="0" data-end="465"&gt;But the Science study has shown that babies do indeed form memories. The mystery is &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; those memories become inaccessible as we grow older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="467" data-end="780"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adw1923"&gt;explanation&lt;/a&gt;, scientists say, is that babies’ brains undergo rapid neurogenesis – the fast-paced creation of new neurons in the brain. This rapid growth might disrupt or “write over” existing memories. In animal studies, when scientists slowed this process in baby mice, the mice were able to retain memories much longer – similar to adult mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1066" data-end="1357"&gt;There is also a hypothesis that episodic memory requires language to describe them and a “sense of self” to relate to them. Since these skills don’t fully develop until around age three or four, the brain might not yet have the tools to organise and retrieve memories in the way adults do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1359" data-end="1665"&gt;Some researchers also think the process of forgetting might serve a developmental purpose. By letting go of specific early experiences, the brain might be better able to focus on building general knowledge – to understand how the world works, for example – without being distracted by detailed memories which no longer serve a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="can-some-people-remember-events-from-infancy"&gt;Can some people remember events from infancy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people claim they can remember being a baby, but there is no evidence that what they describe are genuine episodic memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Yale and Columbia study, this belief typically stems from a psychological process called “source misattribution”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People may remember information, such as that they cried during their first haircut, but not where that information came from. They might unconsciously attribute the memory to personal experience when it actually came from a photo, family stories or a parent’s retelling. Over time, the line between “real” and “reconstructed” has blurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research shows that early family stories, frequent photo viewings or cultural emphasis on early development can all contribute to this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yale is currently conducting a new study in which parents will film their babies regularly, either with their phones angled from the baby’s point of view or by using head-mounted cameras on toddlers. Later, as the children grow older, the researchers will show the children these old videos to see if they recognise the experiences, primarily by monitoring brain activity, to find out how long early memories can last, Yates told Al Jazeera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="could-early-memories-be-recalled-later-in-life"&gt;Could early memories be recalled later in life?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is debate about whether early life memories are completely erased or have simply become inaccessible and could eventually be recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yates said that while the latest study does not answer this question, preliminary evidence from other research at the Yale lab shows that early life memories can be recalled in early childhood, but not later childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think the idea that at least some of our early life memories may exist in some form in our brains as adults is fascinating,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies of adult rodents have shown that early memories can be brought back through approaches such as optogenetics – activating the specific brain cells which are believed to store those memories. This works by identifying the brain cells involved in forming a memory, then later using light to reactivate those same cells, causing the animal to recall the memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Techniques such as optogenetics cannot yet be used in humans, but the study of rodents suggests that the process by which we retrieve memories is where the issue lies, rather than whether the memories exist at all, according to Paul Frankland, senior scientist at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps there are natural conditions where these early life memories become more accessible,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychoanalysts such as Sigmund Freud believed that early childhood memories are not lost but buried deep in the unconscious, and that psychotherapy might help bring them to the surface by changing mental states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Frankland said that this is a “controversial area” as “it is difficult to verify the veracity of recovered memories”.&lt;/p&gt;

All you have to do is put on a weighted backpack or rucksack and start moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a low-impact exercise that is pretty much based on military training — think about how the military trains a lot for endurance, they do a fair amount of running, but they also have to carry a lot of heavy equipment, so that’s kind of how rucking started,” said &lt;a href="https://www.hss.edu/rehab-staff_Welch-Matthew.asp" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Mathew Welch" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58514e4b0d06e412d4dc9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.hss.edu/rehab-staff_Welch-Matthew.asp" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Mathew Welch&lt;/a&gt;, an exercise physiologist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, this exercise offers some extra health rewards on top of a regular walking regimen. Here’s what experts say you should know about rucking and how to try it out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rucking adds resistance training to your walk, and has a host of other fitness benefits, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rucking brings more of a challenge to your daily walk, which is a good thing for someone who is looking to work their body in a new way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Physically, walking is awesome, but sometimes we want to amplify that, and the easy way to do that is adding weight,” Cihlar said. “Resistance training is key, especially as we age, in helping our bone health and our muscle growth because that naturally deteriorates as we get older, starting in our 30s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rucking takes your walk from a cardio exercise to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;cardio plus resistance training. It’s recommended that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/12/well/move/strength-training-beginners-guide.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="you do 20 minutes of strength training" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58514e4b0d06e412d4dc9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/12/well/move/strength-training-beginners-guide.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;you do 20 minutes of strength training&lt;/a&gt; twice a week, but &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30458949/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="research shows that" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58514e4b0d06e412d4dc9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30458949/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;research shows that&lt;/a&gt; most people do not hit that minimum. Rucking can be one way to achieve that goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rucking is also good for your cardiovascular endurance, Welch said. Specifically, rucking benefits your “cardiac output, it’s going to help with the efficiency of your heart pumping the blood out,” Welch explained. This can help lower your blood pressure and improve your heart rate, so it’s a win-win all around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also good for your posture and back strength. “The ruck is kind of pulling you back, so it really forces you to maintain your posture,” Welch said, who added that it’s a good way to offset the hours and hours and hours of sitting you likely do every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Westend61 via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Westend61 via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Going for a walk with a weighted backpack or rucksack on your back is a good way to add resistance training to your walk.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plus, rucking is good for your mental health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rucking is an exercise you do outdoors, and getting outside in itself is great for your mental health. According to &lt;a href="https://mhanational.org/surroundings/outdoors-nature" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Mental Health America" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58514e4b0d06e412d4dc9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://mhanational.org/surroundings/outdoors-nature" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Mental Health America&lt;/a&gt;, getting outside is linked to lower levels of stress and a better mood overall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290997/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="the body produces vitamin D" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58514e4b0d06e412d4dc9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290997/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;the body produces vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; when exposed to sunlight, which is important for bone health and can even help &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9468237/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="curb depression and anxiety symptoms" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58514e4b0d06e412d4dc9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9468237/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;curb depression and anxiety symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re going to always say you never come back from a ruck in a bad mood. It gives you time to clear your head,” Cihlar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are simple ways you can start rucking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting rucking doesn’t have to be complicated. “What’s nice is you can literally start with a backpack you have in your closet and ... throw some magazines in it ... your water bottle,” Cihlar explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also get a rucksack and rucksack weights if you want to use something that is officially made for the sport. Both experts said a rucksack is preferable because it’s safer. A regular backpack can sit pretty low on your back, which can cause issues if you’re carrying around a heavy bag. If you do decide to opt for a backpack, just make sure it isn’t sagging too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to how much weight you’ll want to carry on your back, that depends on your strength level and your size. “I always say start low because you can always grow from there,” Cihlar said. “You don’t want to start heavy and get discouraged.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t a frequent exerciser or weightlifter, starting with just 5 or 10 pounds and building on that is a good idea, she said. As for distance, start with a mile and see how you feel, Cihlar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, if you’re someone that is regularly active and you lift weights, you could probably do a 20-pound plate, a 30-pound plate in your ruck,” Cihlar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting with a mile is a good idea here, too, said Welch, but you can bump it up to a mile and a half or more if you don’t feel challenged. For an additional challenge, take your workout to hilly terrain, Welch added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;While medications may be necessary to manage high cholesterol, diet quality is equally important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oats, avocados, nuts and leafy greens may help improve cholesterol levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To support overall heart health, focus on cooking more at home, eating whole foods and staying physically active.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Approximately 25 million adults in the United States have high cholesterol, which is defined as a total cholesterol level of 240 mg/dL or higher.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is concerning, as having high cholesterol increases your risk of heart disease and metabolic syndrome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Luckily, making a few simple tweaks to your overall lifestyle can go a long way in lowering your cholesterol levels, reducing your risk of disease and helping you live a longer life. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the best places to start is by paying closer attention to what you’re putting in your shopping cart. While medication is often recommended and necessary to manage cholesterol levels, good nutrition is also essential.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Because certain foods have more cholesterol-lowering benefits than others, we asked dietitians to share the top four foods they recommend adding to your grocery list this week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-oats"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Oats  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Easy to find in most grocery stores—you can even get them &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-1-whole-grain-to-buy-at-costco-according-to-a-food-writer-8780277" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;in bulk at Costco&lt;/a&gt;—oats are a must-have pantry staple that won’t break the bank. They’re also one of the best foods for lowering cholesterol levels, thanks to their high &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; content. Soluble fiber binds to cholesterol in the small intestine and prevents it from being absorbed into the bloodstream. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nourishandrenewnutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Korrinna Kelly, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, owner of Nourish &amp;amp; Renew Nutrition, points out that oats are a good source of beta-glucan, “[a type of] soluble fiber that’s been extensively studied for its cholesterol-lowering properties.” One older study found that consuming 3 grams of beta-glucan from oats per day significantly lowered cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This benefit has since been supported by more recent reviews, including one that specifically looked at the benefits of beta-glucan intake in people with high cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to shopping for oats, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7989862/steel-cut-rolled-or-instant-oats-which-is-the-healthiest/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;no one type&lt;/a&gt; is better than another. Whether you prefer the chewy consistency of steel-cut or the convenience of instant, the key is selecting oats that are free from added sugar. In addition to bumping the calorie content, diets high in added sugar can negatively affect cholesterol levels by increasing LDL or “bad” cholesterol levels and decreasing HDL or “good” cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-avocados"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Avocados &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These creamy green fruits are packed full of healthy fats, fiber and even a little protein. One avocado has about 13.5 grams of fiber—nearly half the daily recommended amount for adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating avocados daily has been shown to improve LDL cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Sounds expensive? Not to worry! Even just weekly consumption of avocados has been linked with a reduced risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no shortage of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8057914/avocado-recipes-to-make-forever/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ways to include more avocados&lt;/a&gt; in your weekly meals. This nutritious fruit can be added to salads, blended into smoothies, spread over toast or added to your favorite sandwich. You can even cut it in half and top it with some salt for a simple snack. Oh, and if you haven’t tried grilling avocado yet, you really should as you’re missing out on its full creamy potential. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-nuts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Nuts &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Studies show that eating nuts regularly could help lower LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and potentially increase HDL cholesterol. What’s more, research suggests that people who incorporate nuts into their regular diet may live longer, healthier lives.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Because each nut offers different types and amounts of nutrients, try to incorporate &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;a variety of nuts&lt;/a&gt; throughout the week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nuts are incredibly versatile. They can be enjoyed on their own for a quick snack or added to other dishes, like salads and yogurt, for a delightful crunch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-leafy-greens"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Leafy Greens &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Multiple studies have linked the regular consumption of leafy greens with benefits for cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Greens like spinach, kale and Swiss chard are packed with vitamins, minerals, soluble fiber, antioxidants and other plant compounds that help fight chronic inflammation and prevent the buildup of cholesterol in the body. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides enjoying them in a salad, leafy greens can be sautéed and seasoned for a nutritious side dish, added to baked pasta dishes or blended into your morning smoothie.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-are-optimal-cholesterol-levels"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Are Optimal Cholesterol Levels? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Starting at age 20, it’s recommended that adults have their cholesterol levels checked at least once every four to six years.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; More frequent testing may be recommended for folks at a higher risk of heart disease, such as those with a family history of the condition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are the optimal cholesterol levels for adults, according to the CDC:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total cholesterol:&lt;/strong&gt; around 150 mg/dL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LDL cholesterol:&lt;/strong&gt; 100 mg/dL or less&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDL cholesterol: &lt;/strong&gt;above 40 mg/dL for men and 50 mg/dL for women&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s worth noting that while the CDC sets optimal total cholesterol at 150 mg/dL, other organizations recommend simply keeping total cholesterol below 200 mg/dL.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-strategies-to-lower-your-cholesterol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Strategies to Lower Your Cholesterol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides medications, there are many changes you can make to help improve your cholesterol levels and reduce your risk of heart disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on whole foods. &lt;/strong&gt;This may not come as a surprise, but one of the best ways to support better cholesterol levels is by eating more nutrient-dense whole foods. Fill your plate with whole grains, healthy fats, lean proteins and plenty of colorful fruits and vegetables. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit ultra-processed foods and added sugar. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ultra-processed-foods-cardiovascular-disease-risk-8708994" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Highly processed foods&lt;/a&gt; tend to be higher in unhealthy fats, which can worsen cholesterol levels. Similarly, diets high in added sugar may negatively affect heart health. Ideally, limit added sugars to no more than 9 teaspoons per day for men and 6 teaspoons per day for women.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook more at home.&lt;/strong&gt; “One of the most powerful lifestyle changes to reduce cholesterol levels is to prepare more of your own meals at home,” says &lt;a href="https://coachsimranmd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Simran Malhotra, M.D., DipABLM, CHWC&lt;/a&gt;, a doctor who practices lifestyle medicine and is the founder of Wellness By LifestyleMD. New to cooking? Start with this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7836633/high-cholesterol-diet-plan-for-beginners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;7-Day Cholesterol-Lowering Meal Plan for Beginners&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move more. &lt;/strong&gt;Regular physical activity is good for virtually all aspects of health—including your heart. And you don’t have to lift heavy or run multiple miles to get a good workout. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8042248/walking-plan-to-lower-cholesterol-levels/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Walking regularly&lt;/a&gt; is a great way to strengthen your heart muscle without putting too much strain on your joints. To help lower cholesterol levels and improve heart health, aim to get 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporate plant sterols. &lt;/strong&gt;Plant sterols are naturally occurring compounds found in plant foods, like vegetables, that have been shown to have a cholesterol-lowering effect.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While you can get them through food, folks with high cholesterol may benefit from a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-you-should-take-for-better-heart-health-11698497" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;supplement&lt;/a&gt;. Talk to your doctor about whether a plant sterol supplement might be right for you. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop smoking and limit alcohol intake.&lt;/strong&gt; Smoking is associated with higher cholesterol levels, so quitting as soon as possible may help get your levels down. Similarly, heavy alcohol consumption—defined as more than four or five drinks per day for women or men, respectively—is consistently linked with negative effects on LDL cholesterol and blood pressure levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While you don’t have to give up alcohol completely, it’s recommended to limit intake to no more than one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you have &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cardiologist-recommendations-for-high-cholesterol-8715965" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; or are simply trying to take preventive measures, incorporating avocados, oats, nuts and leafy greens into your regular diet is a great place to start. Of course, diet is just one piece of the puzzle. For optimal heart health, make sure to stay active throughout the day, limit alcohol intake and quit smoking—or avoid starting the habit.

&lt;p&gt;Leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered staff this week not to release their experts’ assessment that found the risk of catching measles is high in areas near outbreaks where vaccination rates are lagging, according to internal records reviewed by ProPublica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an aborted plan to roll out the news, the agency would have emphasized the importance of vaccinating people against the highly contagious and potentially deadly disease that has spread to 19 states, the records show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CDC spokesperson told ProPublica in a written statement that the agency decided against releasing the assessment “because it does not say anything that the public doesn’t already know.” She added that the CDC continues to recommend vaccines as “the best way to protect against measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what the nation’s top public health agency said next shows a shift in its long-standing messaging about vaccines, a sign that it may be falling in line under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” the statement said, echoing a line from a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us"&gt;column Kennedy wrote&lt;/a&gt; for the Fox News website. “People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ProPublica shared the new CDC statement about personal choice and risk with Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health. To her, the shift in messaging, and the squelching of this routine announcement, is alarming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m a bit stunned by that language,” Nuzzo said. “No vaccine is without risk, but that makes it sound like it’s a very active coin toss of a decision. We’ve already had more cases of measles in 2025 than we had in 2024, and it’s spread to multiple states. It is not a coin toss at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many years, the CDC hasn’t minced words on vaccines. It &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/partners/vaccinate-with-confidence.html"&gt;promoted them with confidence&lt;/a&gt;. One campaign was called “&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2022-2023/ad-council-flu-campaign.htm"&gt;Get My Flu Shot&lt;/a&gt;.” The agency’s website &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-children/hcp/conversation-tips/index.html"&gt;told medical providers&lt;/a&gt; they play a critical role in helping parents choose vaccines for their children: “Instead of saying ‘What do you want to do about shots?,’ say ‘Your child needs three shots today.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuzzo wishes the CDC’s forecasters would put out more details of their data and evidence on the spread of measles, not less. “The growing scale and severity of this measles outbreak and the urgent need for more data to guide the response underscores why we need a fully staffed and functional CDC and more resources for state and local health departments,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s agency oversees the CDC and on Thursday announced it was poised to eliminate 2,400 jobs there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked what role, if any, Kennedy played in the decision to not release the risk assessment, HHS’s communications director said the aborted announcement “was part of an ongoing process to improve communication processes—nothing more, nothing less.” The CDC, he reiterated, continues to recommend vaccination “as the best way to protect against measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Secretary Kennedy believes that the decision to vaccinate is a personal one and that people should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine,” Andrew G. Nixon said. “It is important that the American people have radical transparency and be informed to make personal healthcare decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to questions about criticism of the decision among some CDC staff, Nixon wrote, “Some individuals at the CDC seem more interested in protecting their own status or agenda rather than aligning with this Administration and the true mission of public health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s risk assessment was carried out by its Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which relied, in part, on new disease data from the outbreak in Texas. The CDC created the center to address a major shortcoming laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic. It functions like a National Weather Service for infectious diseases, harnessing data and expertise to predict the course of outbreaks like a meteorologist warns of storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other risk assessments by the center have been posted by the CDC even though their conclusions might seem obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late February, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/h5-risk-assessment.html"&gt;forecasters analyzing the spread of H5N1&lt;/a&gt; bird flu said people who come “in contact with potentially infected animals or contaminated surfaces or fluids” faced a moderate to high risk of contracting the disease. The risk to the general US population, they said, was low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the measles assessment, modelers at the center determined the risk of the disease for the general public in the US is low, but they found the risk is high in communities with low vaccination rates that are near outbreaks or share close social ties to those areas with outbreaks. The CDC had moderate confidence in the assessment, according to an internal Q&amp;amp;A that explained the findings. The agency, it said, lacks detailed data about the onset of the illness for all patients in West Texas and is still learning about the vaccination rates in affected communities as well as travel and social contact among those infected. (The H5N1 assessment was also made with moderate confidence.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal plan to roll out the news of the forecast called for the expert physician who’s leading the CDC’s response to measles to be the chief spokesperson answering questions. “It is important to note that at local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist even in areas with high vaccination coverage overall,” the plan said. “The best way to protect against measles is to get the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, though, as the number of confirmed cases rose to 483, more than 30 agency staff were told in an email that after a discussion in the CDC director’s office, “leadership does not want to pursue putting this on the website.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cancellation was “not normal at all,” said a CDC staff member who spoke anonymously for fear of reprisal with layoffs looming. “I’ve never seen a rollout plan that was canceled at that far along in the process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety among CDC staff has been building over whether the agency will bend its public health messages to match those of Kennedy, a lawyer who founded an anti-vaccine group and referred clients to a law firm suing a vaccine manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Kennedy’s first week on the job, HHS halted the CDC campaign that encouraged people to get flu shots during a ferocious flu season. On the night that the Trump administration began firing probationary employees across the federal government, some key CDC flu webpages were taken down. Remnants of some of the campaign webpages were restored after &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated"&gt;NPR reported&lt;/a&gt; this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some at the agency felt like the new leadership had sent a message loud and clear: When next to nobody was paying attention, long-standing public health messages could be silenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day in February that the world learned that an unvaccinated &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/R8XT-4XUB"&gt;child had died&lt;/a&gt; of measles in Texas, the first such death in the U.S. since 2015, the HHS secretary &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/rfk-jr-minimizes-measles-outbreak-in-texas/"&gt;downplayed the seriousness&lt;/a&gt; of the outbreak. “We have measles outbreaks every year,” he said at a cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview on Fox News this month, Kennedy championed doctors in Texas who he said were treating measles with a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, a supplement that is high in vitamin A. “They’re seeing what they describe as almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery from that,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As parents near the outbreak in Texas stocked up on vitamin A supplements, doctors there raced to assure parents that &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/doctors-push-back-parents-embrace-kennedy-vitamin-texas-measles-outbreak-2025-03-08/"&gt;only vaccination, not the vitamin, can prevent measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the CDC added &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html"&gt;an entry on Vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; to its measles website for clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, CNN reported that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/texas-measles-vitamin-a-toxicity/index.html"&gt;several hospitalized children in Lubbock, Texas, had abnormal liver function&lt;/a&gt;, a likely sign of toxicity from too much vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas health officials also said that the Trump administration’s decision to rescind $11 billion in pandemic-related grants across the country &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/26/texas-measles-public-health-funding-cut/"&gt;will hinder their ability to respond&lt;/a&gt; to the growing outbreak, according to The Texas Tribune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is among the most contagious diseases and can be dangerous. About 20 percent of unvaccinated people who get measles wind up in the hospital. And &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;nearly 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children&lt;/a&gt; with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications. The virus can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/causes/index.html"&gt;linger in the air&lt;/a&gt; for two hours after an infected person has left an area, and patients can spread measles before they even know they have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week Amtrak said it was notifying customers that they may have been exposed to the disease this month when a passenger with measles &lt;a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/amtrak-confirms-passenger-measles-traveled-new-york-washington-dc/16085440/"&gt;rode one of its trains&lt;/a&gt; from New York City to Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

But when it's impaired enough due to old age, the brain's resident immune cells, called microglia, have to jump into action instead, which can tax and overwhelm the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By targeting the meningeal lymphatics, the researchers are hoping to overcome a major hurdle for other therapies designed to battle age-related cognitive issues and neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Unlike therapies that struggle to get past the blood-brain barrier, this latest approach targets areas outside of the brain to gain access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The physical blood-brain barrier hinders the efficacy of therapies for neurological disorders," said Washington University pathology and immunology professor Jonathan Kipnis in a &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/boosting-brains-waste-removal-system-improves-memory-in-old-mice/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about the research. "By targeting a network of vessels outside of the brain that is critical for brain health, we see cognitive improvements in mice, opening a window to develop more powerful therapies to prevent or delay cognitive decline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an experiment, the team placed two identical black rods in a cage with old mice to let them play with them. On the next day, the same mice received one of these rods, as well as a silver rectangular prism. The idea is that older mice will spend roughly the same amount of time playing with either type of object, while younger mice will be more drawn to the novel trinket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then used a treatment to boost the growth and function of the lymphatic vessels in some of the old mice. As a result, the researchers observed that they were spending more time playing with the shiny new object — suggesting their memory had improved, compared to other old mice that didn't receive the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A functioning lymphatic system is critical for brain health and memory," said first author and Washington University postdoctoral fellow Kyungdeok Kim in the statement. "Therapies that support the health of the body’s waste management system may have health benefits for a naturally aging brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team suggests that the meningeal lymphatics treatment led to a reduction in the production of an immune protein called interleukin 6 (IL-6), which has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159124004562#:~:text=Elevated%20IL%2D6%20levels%20correlate,brain%20health%20and%20dementia%20risk." class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;previously been shown&lt;/a&gt; to affect brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While plenty of work remains before we can demonstrate that the same approach could work in humans as well, the researchers are hopeful of discovering new ways to slow down the naturally aging brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Targeting the more easily accessible lymphatic vessels that are located outside the brain may prove to be an exciting new frontier in the treatment of brain disorders," Kipnis said. "We may not be able to revive neurons, but we may be able to ensure their most optimal functioning through modulation of meningeal lymphatic vessels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on neurodegenerative diseases:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/ozempic-like-drug-slows-alzheimers-study" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Ozempic-Style Drug Slows the Progression of Alzheimer's Disease, Experiment Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 10:45:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPdXhvNGk5YzIwRlM3ZVJ4dDZ0bmhxR1VLMUtrM1drQ1NRRDk2ckwzLWFZQTVPbEpDMC12WUQ5cUR0X1FhaTBJMW1od29DREdZNVhuYThhc2VsVUN2N3J4YmpXSVowTl9nMS1Zc3dXZVVYTnFSbVVuVm5IYXY2STU0Sw</guid></item><item><title>Non-Statin Cholesterol-Lowering Drug Linked to Lower Cancer Risk - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPTkViQ2sxbUpaeUhGN3JBWXZYckRaTWZ4MU5ieVhqcHBUaHk3ZEswSzcweUxIQ1ozeHpPWDhWV0VjQ0ZrVXdJSkxkRnZwalppQ2tPZ3htUGpFNWJyUGJraVNCTUcxZ0JubkFiRldfQ0daRUV2ZGMyUDlVRkE3WXY3N0xNRHNnQ2FKSTJOSzc0eXVQWVFk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 10:38:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPTkViQ2sxbUpaeUhGN3JBWXZYckRaTWZ4MU5ieVhqcHBUaHk3ZEswSzcweUxIQ1ozeHpPWDhWV0VjQ0ZrVXdJSkxkRnZwalppQ2tPZ3htUGpFNWJyUGJraVNCTUcxZ0JubkFiRldfQ0daRUV2ZGMyUDlVRkE3WXY3N0xNRHNnQ2FKSTJOSzc0eXVQWVFk</guid></item><item><title>What to know about measles breakthrough cases and why vaccination is still important - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxPR2N3TEtibldkYm1PLTduYURmVW1VUlVXWFd0QzYweHFjVjB5c3l0RTBIYXRLQkk2MjhIa2dkSDlHZFhKZFBMQkV3S1NycHd6aThvMFJWa3BEOTVPcUlabERiamJYSWVjbEVpVzhhWGpjOXgtSV9FR0xNaHBTRjFERk1LWkoyV3dha0xtSHd5WUMtdk1aVlRVSFlweU5kQdIBowFBVV95cUxOd1pFS1FDWTRZRHFCazFnTVp2djJxTXFnM3lwdjdiZDVQSloxaTZidlRnd2NKVTMzRFJYdFFKNklpa0x1Wk5jZDNCV2RxYWVwbDlTaUZ1Y2xZdnRhS3ZvajdNcF9HdTljdWFCVjhhNE1Xb1VNU2JzMVUtcm92ZGZjd0RiVWpiNEpLSFdXZy1Ic2Z1UGdCNFRxMEFVdnNxang1bWpj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;As measles has spread across the United States, the overwhelming majority of cases have been among unvaccinated people or those with unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Of the 483 cases reported by the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC), 97% have been confirmed in those who are unvaccinated or with unknown status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;However, a few cases have been confirmed among individuals fully vaccinated with the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In Texas, two of the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;400 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; have been among people fully vaccinated.

The first is called primary vaccine failure, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"That is that small subset of people that just don't form an immune response to the measles vaccine," she told ABC News.

lifestyles play a significant role in dictating our risk of developing the brain-robbing disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that includes the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/food/" rel=""&gt;foods&lt;/a&gt; we eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research published in the journal BMC Medicine found that sticking to a &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/33553716/mediterranean-diet-slash-risk-cancer-obesity-food-shopping-list/" rel=""&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on whole grains, fruits, vegetables, seafood, beans, nuts and healthy fats, could help lower our chances of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/33829513/time-eat-healthily-dementia-stave-off-scientists/" rel=""&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; by up to 23 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts also say there are some specific stand-out &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wellness/33470806/walnut-nut-brain-boost-young-superfood-fast-memory/" rel=""&gt;brain-boosting foods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And despite what you may think, you don’t need to shell out a small fortune at an expensive health store to get them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The 50p brain-booster &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next time you’re at the supermarket, don’t neglect the canned food aisle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tin of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/5434006/eat-more-salmon-prevent-alzheimers-7-steps/" rel=""&gt;sardines&lt;/a&gt; will set you back just 50p in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tesco/" rel=""&gt;Tesco&lt;/a&gt; and is packed full of omega-3 fatty acids, specifically docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are essential for brain function and cognitive health,” Nichola Ludlam-Raine, registered dietitian and author of How Not To Eat Ultra Processed, tells Sun Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DHA makes up about 25 per cent of the fat in the brain and is critical for memory, learning and reducing inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“EPA has anti-inflammatory effects too, which help protect brain cells and reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

of Neuroscience Nursing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Gaunt, nutritionist and biochemist, says that “sustained or chronic inflammation sends the immune system into overdrive”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is this

co-enzyme Q10. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is essential for energy production and can also be found in organ meat - such as kidneys and livers - and many whole grains,” Tim says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other oily fish to consider include salmon, trout, herring, mackerel and anchovies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vegan or veggie? Nuts, flaxseed, chia seeds and seaweed are all sources of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/33172853/slow-ageing-diet-fish-vitamin-d-omega-3-exercise/" rel=""&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;. Or, consider an omega-3 &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/33993827/advice-supplements-vitamins-free-health/" rel=""&gt;supplement&lt;/a&gt; alongside your &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/diet-nutrition-weight-loss/" rel=""&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nichola says: “Omega-3 supplements can be useful for those who do not eat oily fish, but they should not replace a well-balanced diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Other brain-boosting foods &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Blueberries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small but mighty, blueberries are packed full of antioxidants, specifically anthocyanins. These could help to protect your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anthocyanins reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain,” Nichola says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studies suggest they can improve memory, delay cognitive decline, and even improve brain cell communication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry found that supplementing your diet for 12 weeks with blueberry juice, equivalent to half a cup of blueberries, improved memory function in older adults with early memory decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why not try adding blueberries to your cereal in the morning, blending them into a smoothie or just enjoying them as a snack?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can buy a 350g bag of frozen blueberries from &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/asda/" rel=""&gt;Asda&lt;/a&gt; for £1.98. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Spinach &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leafy greens are an easy addition to your day-to-day meals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re packed with folate, vitamin K and antioxidants,” Nichola says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Folate supports neurotransmitter function and has been linked to a lower risk of cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin K plays a role in brain cell protection and may help prevent Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article__quote"&gt;&lt;div class="article__quote-copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swap to wholemeal bread for more fibre, nuts for healthy fats, and sparkling water for less sugar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="article__quote-credit t-p-color"&gt;&lt;span class="quote-credit"&gt;Nichola Ludlam-Raine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="quote-credit-meta"&gt;Dietitian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even just one serving of leafy green vegetables a day could slow age-related cognitive decline, according to research published in the journal Neurology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spinach, kale and lettuce were all included in the study, with half a cup of cooked spinach or one cup of raw lettuce counting towards a daily serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These vegetables, which are available in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/morrisons/" rel=""&gt;Morrisons&lt;/a&gt; for under £2,  contain vitamin E and &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13258143/a-z-of-health-boosting-supplements-vitamins/" rel=""&gt;selenium&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They protect brain cells against damage and inflammation, and work to prevent cognitive decline,” says Tim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__media"&gt;&lt;div class="article__media-img-container open-gallery" data-index="4"&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;&lt;img alt="Close-up of a bunch of blueberries." data-credit="Getty" data-img="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/close-bunch-blueberries-982200135.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" data-caption="Blueberries are thought to have brain-supporting properties" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 335px, (max-width: 520px) 480px, (max-width: 660px) 620px, 940px" srcset="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/close-bunch-blueberries-982200135.jpg?w=940 940w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/close-bunch-blueberries-982200135.jpg?w=335 335w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/close-bunch-blueberries-982200135.jpg?w=480 480w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/close-bunch-blueberries-982200135.jpg?w=620 620w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/close-bunch-blueberries-982200135.jpg?w=1880 1880w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/close-bunch-blueberries-982200135.jpg?w=670 670w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/close-bunch-blueberries-982200135.jpg?w=960 960w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/close-bunch-blueberries-982200135.jpg?w=1240 1240w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/close-bunch-blueberries-982200135.jpg?w=2820 2820w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/close-bunch-blueberries-982200135.jpg?w=1005 1005w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/close-bunch-blueberries-982200135.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/close-bunch-blueberries-982200135.jpg?w=1860 1860w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/close-bunch-blueberries-982200135.jpg?w=3760 3760w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/close-bunch-blueberries-982200135.jpg?w=1340 1340w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/close-bunch-blueberries-982200135.jpg?w=1920 1920w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/close-bunch-blueberries-982200135.jpg?w=2480 2480w" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/close-bunch-blueberries-982200135.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" role="img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="article__gallery-count"&gt;&lt;span class="article__gallery-count-value"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article__media-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="article__media-span"&gt;Blueberries are thought to have brain-supporting properties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="article__credit"&gt;Credit: Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Walnuts &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walnuts are shaped like a brain for a reason, according to Nichola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are the best nuts for brain health,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Walnuts contain alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a plant-based omega-3, along with polyphenols that reduce inflammation and improve brain neuroplasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a process that involves the ability to make structural and functional changes to the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in the journal Nutrients in 2020 showed that eating between 12 and 18 walnut halves was linked to improved cognitive function, as well as a reduced risk of other diseases, including &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/34004583/cholesterol-drugs-statins-ezetimibe-slash-risk-heart-attack-stroke/" rel=""&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/depression/" rel=""&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/diabetes/" rel=""&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research noted that these are all risk factors for the development of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bag of walnut halves is available for £2 in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/sainsburys/" rel=""&gt;Sainsbury's&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;4. Eggs &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs for breakfast could be the secret to a healthier brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in the Journal of Nutrition discovered that older adults who consumed more than one egg per week had a 47 per cent reduced risk of dementia compared to those who consumed less than one egg a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s thought to be because eggs, which cost as little as 18p each in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/aldi/" rel=""&gt;Aldi&lt;/a&gt;, contain the nutrient &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/16386071/the-7-simple-lifestyle-hacks-that-can-help-reduce-your-risk-of-alzheimers/" rel=""&gt;choline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Choline is essential for memory and cognition,” says Nichola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s needed for the production of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in learning and memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eggs also contain B vitamins, which support brain health too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__media"&gt;&lt;div class="article__media-img-container open-gallery" data-index="5"&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;&lt;img alt="Close-up of an open walnut." data-credit="Getty" data-img="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/directly-close-shot-open-walnut-982200104.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" data-caption="Walnuts are the number one best nut for our brains, experts say" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 335px, (max-width: 520px) 480px, (max-width: 660px) 620px, 940px" srcset="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/directly-close-shot-open-walnut-982200104.jpg?w=940 940w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/directly-close-shot-open-walnut-982200104.jpg?w=335 335w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/directly-close-shot-open-walnut-982200104.jpg?w=480 480w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/directly-close-shot-open-walnut-982200104.jpg?w=620 620w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/directly-close-shot-open-walnut-982200104.jpg?w=1880 1880w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/directly-close-shot-open-walnut-982200104.jpg?w=670 670w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/directly-close-shot-open-walnut-982200104.jpg?w=960 960w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/directly-close-shot-open-walnut-982200104.jpg?w=1240 1240w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/directly-close-shot-open-walnut-982200104.jpg?w=2820 2820w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/directly-close-shot-open-walnut-982200104.jpg?w=1005 1005w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/directly-close-shot-open-walnut-982200104.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/directly-close-shot-open-walnut-982200104.jpg?w=1860 1860w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/directly-close-shot-open-walnut-982200104.jpg?w=3760 3760w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/directly-close-shot-open-walnut-982200104.jpg?w=1340 1340w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/directly-close-shot-open-walnut-982200104.jpg?w=1920 1920w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/directly-close-shot-open-walnut-982200104.jpg?w=2480 2480w" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/directly-close-shot-open-walnut-982200104.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" role="img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="article__gallery-count"&gt;&lt;span class="article__gallery-count-value"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article__media-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="article__media-span"&gt;Walnuts are the number one best nut for our brains, experts say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="article__credit"&gt;Credit: Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;5. Dark chocolate &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re in need of something to satisfy your sweet tooth, turn to dark chocolate which contains at least 70 per cent cocoa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nichola says that it contains &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/30506312/foods-flavonoids-slash-dementia-risk-red-wine-chocolate-tea/" rel=""&gt;flavonoids&lt;/a&gt;, which improve blood flow to the brain, boosting focus and memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have found that consuming six additional servings of flavonoid-rich foods per day is associated with a 28 per cent lower risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although dark chocolate contains flavonoids, the flavonoid-rich foods involved in the study, published in JAMA, included tea, red wine and berries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bar of 70 per cent dark chocolate from &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/marks-spencer/" rel=""&gt;M&amp;amp;S&lt;/a&gt; costs £1.25, and you can pick up a box of tea for just £2. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-boxout"&gt;&lt;p class="article-boxout__header t-p-background-color"&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color"&gt;Other simple ways to slash your risk of dementia&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-boxout__content theme__background-color-rgba-20"&gt;&lt;div class="article-boxout__content-img"&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" alt="" data-src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-DEMENTIA.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;quality=100&amp;amp;w=620&amp;amp;h=413&amp;amp;crop=1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/29384805/effective-ways-slash-risk-dementia-england-diagnoses/" rel=""&gt;Isabel Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, Health Reporter &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AS there's currently no cure for dementia, experts recommend focusing on ways to reduce your risk of developing the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some people, just going to work could do wonders for protecting their brain - as a &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/32342915/alzheimers-risk-lowered-specific-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; found two specific &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/jobs/"&gt;jobs&lt;/a&gt; were linked to the lowest risk of death from &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers raised the possibility that jobs that require frequent spatial processing — such as figuring out a taxi route or the best way to navigate to a hospital — could lead to lower rates of death from Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of their investigation, the team from Mass General Brigham used national data on the occupations of people who had died to evaluate risk of death from Alzheimer's disease across 443 professions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results, published in The BMJ, found taxi &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/driving/"&gt;driving&lt;/a&gt; and ambulance driving were associated with a lower rate of death from the disease compared to other jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The same part of the brain that's involved in creating cognitive spatial maps - which we use to navigate the world around us - is also involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease," said lead author Vishal Patel, a resident physician in the Department of Surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hypothesised that occupations such as taxi driving and ambulance driving, which demand real-time spatial and navigational processing, might be associated with a reduced burden of Alzheimer's disease mortality compared with other occupations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are ways for everyone to lower their risk.

(UPFs) can help protect the brain, improve memory and reduce your dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Nichola says that UPFs don’t need to be avoided altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's just that too many of them in the diet means that not enough whole foods are being eaten to support your health,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Too many ultra-processed foods (in place of whole foods) can increase inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance, all of which can harm brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I suggest people cut down on sugary drinks and refined carbohydrates such as white bread, sweets, biscuits and fizzy drinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Swap to wholemeal bread for more fibre, nuts for healthy fats, and sparkling water for less sugar.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nichola also recommends cutting back on processed &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/29586428/bacon-sausage-nuts-beans-reduce-demenita/" rel=""&gt;red meats&lt;/a&gt;

More than 23,000 study participants with new-onset type 2 diabetes were matched to over 71,000 other participants without the condition based on their &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323586" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;body mass index (BMI)&lt;/a&gt;, age, and gender, with an average follow-up of 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists also searched for incidents of obesity-related cancers, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research has shown that cancer-related mortality is increasing in people with type 2 diabetes and we want to help identify whether type 2 diabetes is causing cancer, or are the increased cancers in people living with type 2 diabetes due to the coexistence of obesity,” Owen Tipping, BSc, an MBPhD researcher at the University of Manchester and co-lead author of this study told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This can help with the creation of new potential cancer preventative measures and guide whether people with diabetes should undergo cancer screening,” Tipping explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We decided to look at type 2 diabetes and obesity-related cancers because obesity has strong evidence for a causal association with at least 13 cancer types, but this is not so clear for type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes and obesity are associated with similar cancers, and these conditions also often co-exist, making it difficult to decipher whether type 2 diabetes causes cancer, or whether it’s due to coexiting obesity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Owen Tipping, BSc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the study’s conclusion, Tipping and his team found that new-onset type 2 diabetes was correlated to a 48% increased risk of developing an obesity-related cancer in men, and a 24% heightened chance in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The significance of this is that type 2 diabetes may increase risk of cancer independent of obesity, rather than it being solely due to obesity — i.e in the scenario where a person living with diabetes has a healthy BMI value,” Tipping explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, scientists found a link between new-onset type 2 diabetes and an increased risk for three of the researched obesity-related cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colorectal cancer risk increased by 27% for men and 34% for women, liver cancer chances almost quadrupled for men and increased five-fold for women. And pancreatic cancer risk almost doubled for women and increased by 74% for men.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The significance of [these findings] is that whilst obesity is causally associated with these cancers, there is evidence from this study that type 2 diabetes is also associated — might be causal here, but more evidence is needed to confirm this,” Tipping said. “Cancer screening for people living with type 2 diabetes might be beneficial to detect these cancers early.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We plan to replicate this study in cohorts of different ancestry, to verify whether these findings are consistent across different populations,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;

also spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/jack-f-jacoub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Jack Jacoub&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified medical oncologist and medical director of MemorialCare Cancer Institute at Orange Coast and Saddleback Medical Centers in Orange County, CA, about this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacoub commented that for him, it was still unclear how strong the link is between type 2 diabetes and the cancers discussed in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The obesity-related cancers and the lifestyle modifications that individuals can make to reduce that is probably the bigger message,” Jacoub explained. “It’s interesting, but I wouldn’t go out and tell every type 2 diabetic they’re at increased risk for X number of cancers and to worry about that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I would just tell them to try to focus on improving their &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317216" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;hemoglobin A1C&lt;/a&gt; and getting their sugar under control and their weight under control,” he advised.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s been several data sets about trying to treat the insulin pathway or use the insulin pathway as somehow a benefit to patients with cancer,” Jacoub continued. “There’s a case of giving an anti-diabetic drug, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/metformin-oral-tablet" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;metformin&lt;/a&gt;, in the case of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10974219/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; — it’s a very large trial going on — and others to see if there’s any possible way to impact it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it still always comes down to core principles for patients because there’s only so much in your control,” Jacoub added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Type 2 diabetes, unlike &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323729" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;insulin-dependent [type 1] diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, is one mediated by weight, diet, lack of activity, etc. And if those are things that you can improve, there’s downstream benefits, not only reducing these cancers, but others as well [and] cardiovascular disease,” he pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 06:12:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxNeGVpVi1GRmJkRGF1Z1V0MXNoME8tV1lIeU5OQzB2VTk0QU80dEFPeEtmVXZZMDJ0dVpuV3M3ejRvejg4cHhmbmhGUE92bHZvRllVQlV5T3JpOWQxQU1fUGxXOE9mRTI5QkgyVmFhVjd2NV9lLU5ERW1OQmlhelZwVlMwSVFRSVFYZWxGdWgtVnlkN0hiLVZsMEZvb0tLUjF0ZUJiTHJnZHNHMG15OHhmZnZVTDYwWldobnVCeXJ2U09pQQ</guid></item><item><title>7 common mistakes that can worsen the effects of diabetes on our body - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi_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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living with diabetes requires daily attention and lifestyle adjustments. In India alone, more than &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/india/diabetes#:~:text=Diabetes%20in%20India&amp;amp;text=In%20India%2C%20there%20are%20estimated,developing%20diabetes%20in%20near%20future)." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;77 million&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; people suffer from diabetes, and over 25 million are pre-diabetic. In such a case, one might think the people must have learned how to live life through diabetes, but here, we are wrong. Many people unknowingly make mistakes that can worsen its effects on the body. These errors may seem small, but over time, they can lead to serious health complications. From ignoring foot care to skipping eye exams, here are some common mistakes that diabetics should avoid to manage their condition effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ignoring foot care&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with diabetes overlook the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/preventing-problems/foot-problems" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;importance of foot care,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; but high blood sugar levels can damage nerves and reduce circulation, making the feet vulnerable to infections. Small cuts, blisters, or sores may go unnoticed and turn into severe ulcers. Wearing comfortable footwear, keeping feet clean, and inspecting them daily can prevent serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Following a “one-size-fits-all” diet&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common mistake is assuming that a generic "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9039967/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;healthy diet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;" works for everyone with diabetes. In reality, each person's body responds differently to food. Some diabetics may tolerate certain carbohydrates better than others. Skipping meals, eating too much fruit, or over-relying on "diabetic-friendly" processed foods can lead to blood sugar spikes. A customised meal plan, guided by a nutritionist, is the best way to maintain stable glucose levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Not monitoring blood sugar levels regularly&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people with diabetes only check their &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/managing-diabetes" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; when they feel unwell, which can be dangerous. Blood sugar fluctuations often go unnoticed, leading to silent damage over time. Regular monitoring helps identify patterns, avoid sudden spikes or crashes, and adjust diet, medication, or lifestyle accordingly. Even when feeling fine, routine checks are essential for long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avoiding exercise completely&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some diabetics avoid physical activity because they fear low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) or believe &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6908414/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; will make them feel exhausted. However, staying inactive can make insulin resistance worse and lead to weight gain. Simple activities like walking, stretching, or light yoga can improve blood sugar control. The key is to start slow, stay hydrated, and adjust exercise routines based on individual needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Since early symptoms often go unnoticed, many people do not realize their vision is at risk. Regular eye exams help detect issues early and prevent complications. Even if there are no vision problems, annual check-ups are a must.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ignoring stress and sleep issues&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress and poor sleep are often underestimated factors in diabetes management. Chronic stress can raise blood sugar levels, while lack of sleep affects insulin sensitivity. Many diabetics focus only on diet and medication but ignore mental health. Practicing relaxation techniques like meditation, getting enough sleep, and managing stress effectively can make a big difference in blood sugar control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Herbal supplements that can worsen diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Relying too much on medication alone&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people with diabetes believe that taking medication alone is enough to control their condition. However, lifestyle choices play an equally important role. Over-reliance on medicines without making necessary changes in diet, physical activity, and stress management can lead to long-term complications. Diabetes management requires a balance of medication, healthy eating, and active living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 04:41:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_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</guid></item><item><title>Weight Loss Breakthrough: Stanford Scientists Discover “Natural Ozempic” Without the Side Effects - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxPa3Q3V0x3TW80ZFZobDZGUFRuTkpHNWVvREwwT2VoRGhpQm1vbE5sVm9YSUotTGlNZU1wbWxjM09IbzJHanB4a25OenlQczNtaWVxczhKaHQ3bTVwRW9wbFczY19mejNJaXNxQWx3UHpFT25GWUZPQ2RMa2RHTUdEWERGNTM5WGc4VHpkUXUxYmFWWWxaS18ySERLRGY1WUlpRzVIS09NVmhfbXVtdjJDa0c5dmdjWlJ6OHlhbQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 02:36:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxPa3Q3V0x3TW80ZFZobDZGUFRuTkpHNWVvREwwT2VoRGhpQm1vbE5sVm9YSUotTGlNZU1wbWxjM09IbzJHanB4a25OenlQczNtaWVxczhKaHQ3bTVwRW9wbFczY19mejNJaXNxQWx3UHpFT25GWUZPQ2RMa2RHTUdEWERGNTM5WGc4VHpkUXUxYmFWWWxaS18ySERLRGY1WUlpRzVIS09NVmhfbXVtdjJDa0c5dmdjWlJ6OHlhbQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
