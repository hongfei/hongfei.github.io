So, she'd wait until he left and then wash herself thoroughly. She tried changing the personal care products she was using, from soap to lubricant. But the problem only worsened, extending to swelling and redness. And it only happened after she came into contact with semen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Eventually she broke up with that man, and started seeing one who was dedicated to using condoms. "It wasn't an issue until one night when we were lying in bed after sex and my tongue suddenly began to swell," Maura recounts. "My partner saw what was happening, screamed, 'You're asphyxiating!' and grabbed my inhaler…he was able to cram my inhaler into the corner of my mouth, and he just started firing it. Luckily, I was still breathing enough to draw the medicine into my lungs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Maura, who also has asthma and a number of allergies, believes that the condom had leaked. She and her long-term partner are now even more careful about condom usage. Until it happened to her, she didn't know it was possible to be allergic to semen, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Though they're extremely rare, some people suffer severe immune reactions to other people's bodies. These often-misunderstood conditions can affect not just health, but also work, relationships and generally how someone moves through the world. But how exactly these reactions unfold, and what causes them, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdv.14762" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;remains largely mysterious&lt;/a&gt;.

PATM is an unusual and isolating phenomenon where others frequently develop allergy-type symptoms, such as coughing and choking, in their presence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In 2023, Yoshika Sekine, a professor of chemistry at Japan's Tokai University, and his colleagues investigated the skin gases emitted by those reporting symptoms of PATM. Of the 75 skin gases the team studied, toluene was especially likely to be present. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-36615-1" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;People in the PATM group emitted 39 times more of this chemical&lt;/a&gt;, on average, than those without the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Toluene is inhaled through the air during breathing. As a harmful compound, it is typically metabolised by the liver and excreted in the urine," Sekine explains. "However, PATM patients have a diminished ability to break down toluene, leading to its accumulation in the bloodstream and subsequent release through the skin," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Sekine notes that the very concept of PATM is still not widely recognised, and there are no diagnostic criteria for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;&lt;span id="from-bodily-fluids" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="from-bodily-fluids" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;From bodily fluids&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Allergic reactions can also be triggered by specific allergens carried in bodily fluids. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.jiaci.org/summary/vol17-issue3-num224?1" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;In one UK case&lt;/a&gt;, a woman with an allergy to Brazil nuts developed hives and shortness of breath after having sex with a man who had eaten mixed nuts a few hours earlier, even though he had cleaned his teeth, nails and skin in between. Nuts have also led to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200206063462320" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;allergic reactions during kissing&lt;/a&gt; in people with severe allergies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;While nuts are the most commonly reported allergen posing an issue during kissing, saliva has also induced allergic reactions following the consumption of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.eurannallergyimm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/complete-issue-4824allp1.pdf#page=5" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;fruits, vegetables, seafood and milk&lt;/a&gt;. Women with antibiotic allergies have reacted negatively after &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2222.1996.tb00100.x?sid=nlm%3Apubmed" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;vaginal&lt;/a&gt; and (possibly) &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6424187/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;oral sex&lt;/a&gt; with people who had taken those medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But beyond these external allergens, proteins within certain bodily fluids themselves can also trigger a reaction.

It has been recorded mainly in people in their 20s and 30s, although there have been fewer than 100 documented cases overall, according to a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medicine/articles/10.3389/fmed.2024.1403477/full" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;2024 paper&lt;/a&gt;. The allergen most frequently linked to this sensitivity is a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aji.13865" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;prostate-specific antigen&lt;/a&gt;, a substance that can trigger an immune response, in the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5640966/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;seminal plasma&lt;/a&gt;. This is the fluid, apart from sperm, that makes up the majority of semen, and the allergy is to a protein within it, rather than the sperm itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It's not clear exactly what is occurring in the body in people with seminal plasma hypersensitivity, explains Jonathan Bernstein, a professor of clinical medicine, focusing on allergy and immunology, at the University of Cincinnati’s College of Medicine in the US. Bernstein says that there aren't good animal models for seminal plasma hypersensitivity, or enough humans with the condition to enable large-scale research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The local symptoms can include severe pain and burning immediately after intercourse. "It's [reportedly] like acid," Bernstein says. One of his patients described it as "like a thousand needles being stuck into your vagina."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="callout-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fpVHcM"&gt;&lt;section class="sc-2d378821-0 duQDIB"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2d378821-1 dBCBSi"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-2d378821-3 djFilw"&gt;What we don’t know about sperm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A person might be sensitive to the semen of multiple partners or just one, Bernstein notes. Diagnosis typically involves a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aji.13865" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;skin prick test using a fresh sample of seminal fluid&lt;/a&gt; from a sexual partner. In his practice, Bernstein typically sees women in monogamous relationships with men, often when they're trying to get pregnant. Some people travel long distances to consult with him, as there aren't many authorities on semen allergy. Many patients get brushed aside or are started on aggressive steroid treatments because medical professionals don't know what to do with them, Bernstein says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, Bernstein explains that his practice is able to help just about everyone with a semen allergy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There is a notable absence of data about semen allergies among men who have sex with men. Bernstein says he has never seen a case of this, though it’s unclear why. He wondered if the symptoms could be related to the particular conditions within the vagina, though this doesn’t explain the case where it occurred after anal sex between a man and a woman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;&lt;span id="treatment-options" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="treatment-options" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;Treatment options&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250611-093910-fc500e843d-web-2.23.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lj50dr.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lj50dr.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lj50dr.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lj50dr.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lj50dr.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lj50dr.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lj50dr.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lj50dr.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lj50dr.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lj50dr.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Immune reactions to other humans can have distressing consequences (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Immune reactions to other humans can have distressing consequences (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Bernstein and his colleagues found that it was reportedly &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1081120613000057" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;equally safe and effective to localise the treatment&lt;/a&gt;, in a one-time procedure of about two hours. First, they separated the sperm from the seminal fluid. Then they diluted the seminal fluid to one part in a million or one in ten million, depending on how severe the patient's reactions were. Then, at intervals of 15 minutes, they inserted the fluid into the patient's vagina. They gradually used stronger concentrations of the fluid, so that the patient developed a greater tolerance. Throughout, they continued monitoring the patient. As a result, "they don't tend to have many systemic reactions and they are able to tolerate unprotected intercourse thereafter" with at least that partner, Bernstein says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In general, hypersensitivity to seminal plasma remains often &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aji.13865" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;misunderstood and misdiagnosed&lt;/a&gt;. There's even less information about certain other fluids transmitted during sex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdv.14762" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;almost no published research&lt;/a&gt; on possible allergy to cervicovaginal fluid – a liquid secreted by the cells of the cervix and vagina, which helps to lubricate this region and provide some &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3016264/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;protection from pathogens&lt;/a&gt;. However, Marek Jankowski believes that he’s seen at least one person with this condition. Jankowski, an assistant professor of dermatology and venereology at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Poland, says he once treated a patient who came to him after seeing a host of other doctors. The patient reported that about 30 minutes after vaginal intercourse, his genitals would become red and itchy. His face would also itch after cunnilingus. To the patient, this seemed like an allergy, but doctors ridiculed or rejected this idea, says Jankowski. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, Jankowski kept an open mind, looking up other cases of potential allergy to cervicovaginal fluid secreted by women during sexual activity. "Ultimately the patient responded well to antihistamines," he reports. The case also prompted Jankowski and his colleagues to carry out &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdv.14550" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2017. The researchers surveyed other dermatologists as well as people who might be experiencing this condition. One-fifth of the dermatologists who responded had witnessed such cases, they reported, though many doctors remained sceptical that the condition existed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;The emotional impacts can be complex, for both sufferers and their partners&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;According to this research, sufferers reported redness, itch, burning, swelling and hives following contact. Their reports &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdv.14550" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;led Jankowski and his colleagues to estimate&lt;/a&gt; that allergy to cervicovaginal fluid was as common as semen allergy, which is thought to affect at least tens of thousands of people in the US alone. However, "the current level of evidence for cervicovaginal fluid allergy phenomenon is only circumstantial and further research in this field would be necessary," Jankowski explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;One difference between allergies to semen versus cervicovaginal fluid is that condoms would be unlikely to relieve the symptoms of any allergy to the latter, since condoms &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdv.14550" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;would not shield the groin and scrotum&lt;/a&gt;. But both antihistamines and repeat exposure appeared to help the survey respondents with their allergy to cervicovaginal fluid, according to the survey results of Jankowski and his coauthors. "As [the] majority of cases identified were young adults early in the sexual relationship, the flame of passion was apparently stronger than the discomfort, and repetitive [exposure] to the allergen led to desensitisation," Jankowski notes. This differs from seminal plasma hypersensitivity, which is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aji.13865" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;not known to resolve itself naturally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For the people who are allergic to some aspect of their partner, the consequences can be grave. Maura believes that her semen sensitivity played a part in her and her partner's decision to not have children, because she expects that it would have been expensive to find a workaround that enabled her to avoid exposure to semen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The emotional impacts can be complex, for both sufferers and their partners. While Maura's relationship is safe and her partner is happy to use condoms, "he did tell me that he was offended by the idea that I was allergic to his semen," she says. “He doesn't blame me for that, just the universe." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 09:15:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPREsyR2o2SnpCU2lpX1RCR08wbkdwbThhMmRDRGFwUWc5aHVJck5vMl9ITW5kcEZoS2Rxb3lvR3NvNHFJcHAzNTFUUGp5aGZOTjJhaGU3bmhuT3IteTRrWFJQOWNtUWhya1l2cVNrdzFnVENhNXlCLTJ4UVQ1N251OVFZVFV3WkFh</guid></item><item><title>细菌感染在几天内杀死一个十几岁的男孩：症状，快速移动的疾病的原因-印度时报 | Bacterial infection kills a teen boy within days: Symptoms, causes of the fast-moving illness - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 14-year-old boy from South Carolina has tragically passed away just days after catching a rare and fast-moving bacterial infection, and now doctors are warning others to be aware of the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Hand, a recent 8th-grade graduate from Hughes Academy of Science and Technology, started feeling really unwell early on June 8. He woke up before 5 a.m., and according to his father, Will Hand, things went downhill fast. In a heartbreaking Facebook post, he wrote, "Everything snowballed and God called him home." He shared a photo of his son, remembering him with "flowing hair, big smile and in sports attire," saying, "I will see you again, son."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What happened to William?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will had developed a rare blood infection called meningococcemia—also known as meningococcal septicemia. It’s caused by the Neisseria meningitidis bacteria, which enters the bloodstream and spreads quickly. Once it kicks in, it can be extremely hard to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Anna-Kathryn Burch told Fox Carolina, how brutal the illness can be: “The infection happens so quickly, and once it starts going, sometimes it’s very hard to save the person who is infected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease spreads through saliva or respiratory droplets—meaning things like kissing, sharing drinks, or using the same utensils can pass it on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does someone catch it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meningococcal septicemia is basically a rare—and very serious—blood infection caused by a type of bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis. You might’ve heard more about meningitis, which is when the same bacteria attack the lining of the brain and spinal cord. But in septicemia, instead of staying in the brain, the bacteria invade your bloodstream and start causing chaos throughout your entire body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This bacteria normally lives quietly in the back of the nose and throat of some people (called carriers) without making them sick. But every now and then, it can go rogue—especially if it finds its way into the bloodstream. Once it's in your blood, it multiplies like crazy and starts releasing toxins that damage blood vessels, mess with your circulation, and can quickly lead to organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does someone catch it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It spreads through close contact—think coughing, sneezing, kissing, or sharing things like drinks, straws, water bottles, lip balm, or utensils. You usually have to be in close or prolonged contact with someone who is carrying the bacteria. That’s why outbreaks can happen in places like college dorms, military barracks, or households where people are living close together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what actually happens? Once these bacteria enter the blood, they multiply rapidly and release toxins that can damage blood vessels. This can lead to internal bleeding, organ failure, and tissue damage—sometimes in just a matter of hours. That’s what makes it so terrifying: the speed. One minute a person might just feel a little unwell, and within a day—or sometimes even less—they’re in critical condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms can look like a regular flu or a bad cold. We're talking fever, chills, body aches, nausea, cold hands and feet, or a fast heart rate. In kids and teens, symptoms can include extreme tiredness, irritability, or a rash that doesn’t fade when pressed (a big red flag). That rash comes from bleeding under the skin, caused by blood vessel damage. It might start out as small red or purple spots and then spread quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tricky part is how fast it moves. With many illnesses, you’ve got some time to figure out what’s going on. Not with this one. That’s why doctors and parents are always urged to trust their instincts—if someone looks seriously sick and symptoms are worsening quickly, it’s better to get them to a hospital ASAP rather than wait it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news? It’s treatable—but only if caught early. Meningococcal septicemia is usually treated with strong antibiotics through an IV. Fluids, oxygen, and sometimes even medications to support blood pressure may also be needed. In severe cases, people may end up in the ICU or require surgery to remove damaged tissue. Even then, survivors might face long-term effects like hearing loss, amputations, or organ damage. That’s how serious this infection can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meningococcal septicemia is rare, but when it strikes, it’s aggressive. Knowing the signs, acting quickly, and staying vaccinated can make all the difference.

&lt;p&gt;Kegel exercises, also known as pelvic floor squeezes, are one of the most common and effective ways to build strength and control in your pelvic floor muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exercises can help you work towards preventing or reducing the severity of pelvic floor issues such as incontinence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, according to Leanne O'Brien, pelvic floor physical therapist at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ten.co.uk/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ten.co.uk/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Ten Health&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a chance you’re not doing them properly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Around 70% of people aren't doing pelvic floor exercises correctly and I can vouch for that clinically,” O’Brien tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;. “If the technique isn’t good, you won’t be getting the maximum benefit of the exercises.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-not-to-do-pelvic-floor-squeezes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How not to do pelvic floor squeezes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the common mistakes happens because people struggle with which body part they should be squeezing. “They’ll start squeezing their bum cheeks together, or they’ll squeeze their inner thighs together, or they’ll grip their abdominal muscles,” says O’Brien.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“If you do this, it will start to press the pelvic floor down again,” which is the opposite of what you want to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-pelvic-floor-squeezes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do pelvic floor squeezes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re doing pelvic floor squeezes properly, “no-one would be able to tell that you’re doing them”, says O’Brien, because none of your body parts should move. Instead, you’re squeezing the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Anal_Canal" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Anal_Canal" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;rectum&lt;/a&gt;, which is located between your colon and anus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Imagine that you’re stopping yourself from emptying your bowel or stopping yourself from farting,” says O’Brien. “We're squeezing the bum hole, to be graphic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also think of squeezing the vaginal muscles at the same time. “Try to imagine that you have a blueberry just at the vaginal entrance, and you're trying to draw that up and in towards the body,” O’Brien suggests before giving her full description.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You're essentially starting from the back—squeezing the rectum, squeezing the vagina muscles, then imagining your stopping a flow of urine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-8RiTVyVodKbLAfFcwfQDNb" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-8RiTVyVodKbLAfFcwfQDNb slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-long-should-you-hold-pelvic-floor-squeezes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How long should you hold pelvic floor squeezes?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone’s pelvic floor strength is different, which means pelvic floor squeezes will be more challenging for some people than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Three seconds will be effective for some people, but if you are particularly strong and active, you might need to look at a longer duration, such as 10 to 15 seconds,” says O’Brien.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a general rule, you should be able to hold your pelvic floor for 10 seconds with a five second rest, and you should be able to do that 10 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It should never be uncomfortable. If it is, it’s possible that you’re holding your breath, or you’re bracing your abdominal muscles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Brien recommends an app called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://squeezyapp.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://squeezyapp.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Squeezy&lt;/a&gt; that will walk you through exactly how to do the exercise and provide you with a timer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption class="inline-layout "&gt;&lt;div class="caption-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Brien recommends an app called &lt;a href="https://squeezyapp.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://squeezyapp.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Squeezy&lt;/a&gt; that will walk you through exactly how to do the exercise and provide you with a timer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Squeezy)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-often-should-you-do-pelvic-floor-squeezes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How often should you do pelvic floor squeezes?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you don’t have any pelvic floor symptoms, I would say do squeezes between two and three times a week,” says O’Brien.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, if you do have symptoms, consult a medical professional first. “It could be a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/wellness/why-squeezes-might-be-making-your-pelvic-floor-symptoms-worse-according-to-an-expert-physical-therapist" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/wellness/why-squeezes-might-be-making-your-pelvic-floor-symptoms-worse-according-to-an-expert-physical-therapist"&gt;tight pelvic floor&lt;/a&gt;,” says O’Brien, explaining that in this case, you won’t benefit from squeezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you know you have a weak pelvic floor, aim to do squeezes daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-position-should-you-do-pelvic-floor-squeezes-in"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What position should you do pelvic floor squeezes in?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pelvic floor squeezes are discrete, which is great because it means you can do them at anywhere—on the train, at your desk or while waiting for a friend to arrive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But if you are finding them uncomfortable or want better results, O’Brien suggests doing them lying down. “Lie down with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor, or flat on a bed, because that’s a relaxed position for the pelvic floor,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

US hospitals have stepped up&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-13146609/lab-killer-fungi-weapons-pandemic.html"&gt; mold inspections and antifungal protocols&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Aspergillus fungus is a toxic fungus that produces aflatoxin, one of the most powerful naturally occurring carcinogens. This can cause cancers and disorders of the lung, liver, spleen, stomach, colon and kidney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Co-author Norman van Rhijn, from the University of Manchester, told the Financial Times: 'We're talking about hundreds of thousands of lives, and continental shifts in species distributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In 50 years, where things grow and what you get infected by is going to be completely different.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 400,000 of these cases develop into chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, a long-term lung infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Invasive aspergillosis is less common but far deadlier. It mainly targets people with weakened immune systems and can spread from the lungs to the brain, heart, and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2874071/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found only 59 percent of organ transplant patients survived a year after infection, and just 25 percent of stem cell transplant patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hospitalizations for invasive aspergillosis in the US rose about three percent annually from 2000 to 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By 2014, nearly 15,000 hospital stays were recorded, costing an estimated $1.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;ICU autopsies show aspergillosis ranks among the top four infections likely to cause death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The World Health Organization lists Aspergillus fumigatus as a 'critical priority' fungal threat due to rising drug resistance and high death rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fungus thrives in warm, damp environments, even surviving temperatures above 120 degrees Fahrenheit in compost piles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Close up of Aspergillus oryzae is a filamentous fungus, or mold that is used in food production, such as in soybean fermentation for education in laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Climate change is making it easier for the fungus to survive inside the human body as global temperatures rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A new study conducted by &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6545782/v1"&gt;University of Manchester&lt;/a&gt; found that if fossil fuel use continues at current levels, the fungus could expand by more than 75 percent by 2100, putting millions more at risk in the southern US, where conditions mirror those forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Azole drugs, widely used to treat fungal infections in humans, are also heavily applied in agriculture to protect crops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn this overuse may be driving drug resistance, which can transfer from the environment to humans and reduce treatment effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study published in the&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.01782-23"&gt; Applied and Environmental Microbiology&lt;/a&gt;, found azole-resistant, Aspergillus fumigatus in farm soil across at least seven US states, with many strains resistant to standard antifungal drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists warn the mixing of different fungal types is speeding resistance spread and suggests the problem is already deeply rooted in US soil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The WHO urges immediate investment in safer drugs, faster testing, and better training for health workers, while calling on drug companies to prioritize fungal research and include children in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This isn't science fiction,' said Dr Vyas, an infectious disease expert at Columbia University.

Fruits offer numerous health benefits, including reducing the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes, improving digestion, and providing essential vitamins and minerals. They are a good source of fiber, antioxidants, and phytonutrients, all of which contribute to overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, from all the good press fruits have, we tend to deem fruit juices as a good alternative to raw fruits as well.

A healthy liver is vital for overall well-being, playing a key role in digestion, waste removal, and blood clotting. Maintaining liver health involves a combination of lifestyle choices, including a balanced diet, moderate alcohol consumption, and avoiding toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the liver processes everything we consume, including sugars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fructose, a sugar found in fruits, is metabolized in the liver. While small amounts are manageable, excessive intake can overwhelm the liver's capacity, leading to fat accumulation and liver inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does research say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In analyzing data from over half a million people across multiple continents, researchers at Brigham Young University recently found something unexpected: that sugar consumed through drinks like soda—and even pure fruit juice, which is high in naturally occurring fructose—appeared to be more harmful than sugar that is eaten in foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karen Della Corte, lead author and BYU nutritional science professor, said in a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.byu.edu/intellect/rethinking-sugar-byu-study-shows-food-source-is-key-to-understanding-diabetes-risk" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, “This is the first study to draw clear dose-response relationships between different sugar sources and Type 2 diabetes risk,” adding, “It highlights why drinking your sugar—whether from soda or juice—is more problematic for health than eating it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per the study, with each additional eight-ounce serving of fruit juice per day—including 100% fruit juice, nectars, and juice drinks—the risk for developing T2D (Type 2 diabetes) increased by 5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fruit Juices: a concentrated source of sugar&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike whole fruits, fruit juices lack fiber, which helps slow sugar absorption. A single glass of fruit juice can contain the sugar equivalent of several pieces of fruit, leading to a rapid spike in blood sugar levels. This sudden influx of sugar forces the liver to work overtime, increasing the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Hence, while fruit juices are often perceived as healthy, their high sugar content and potential additives can pose risks to liver health when consumed in excess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The link between fruit juice and liver disease&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown a correlation between high consumption of fruit juices and an increased risk of NAFLD. For instance, a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37543090/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; involving over 136,000 participants found that a higher intake of pure fruit juice was associated with a higher risk of NAFLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The role of artificial sweeteners&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about sugary fruits. Packed cartons of fruit juice contain way more than just fructose. Commercially available fruit juices contain added sugars or artificial sweeteners to enhance flavor and taste profile. These additives can further exacerbate liver strain. Some artificial sweeteners have been linked to liver toxicity and metabolic disturbances, compounding the negative effects on liver health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is that no fruit juice, safe enough for the liver?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out, there is an exception indeed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;It’s the grapefruit juice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grapefruit juice is known to interact with various medications by inhibiting the enzyme CYP3A4, which is involved in drug metabolism. This interaction can lead to higher levels of certain drugs in the bloodstream, increasing the risk of side effects and liver toxicity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s the solution then?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it's not necessary to eliminate fruit juices entirely, moderation is key to maintaining a crucial balance between health and taste. Being mindful of juice intake and opting for whole fruits can support liver function and overall well-being. If you choose to consume fruit juice, opt for freshly squeezed varieties without added sugars and limit intake to small amounts. Pairing juice with a balanced diet rich in whole fruits, vegetables, and fiber can help mitigate potential risks to liver health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Fatty liver diet: Best and worst foods for your liver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 01:42:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_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</guid></item><item><title>由于医生发出可怕的警告， 14岁的青少年在感染罕见的细菌感染后几天内死亡-每日邮报 | Teenager, 14, dies within days of catching rare bacterial infection as doctors issue terrifying warning - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxONmZjWUd0Vk9ucktkNWF3XzQtQWszcnpwVDRtczJNZU1tUHdSeE5oOFh2OFFfbFJVOEl1c2dHVkU2NnZ0czV5XzNDUXZIVi1ZSmdwYm9Mdkw0dm1waHpBb1BQQS1oR3FkQ2Y2YVpna1dHV2xQQkdXQnFGRFF2b1gzeDBHWUNfWDU4WTJSUndmMVo3ZkxoUFd3NdIBngFBVV95cUxPTUJNenJNNzMwYllMWG5jVXpnTmowejFaTjUweV9xT0J4aklGSFd5VnlhdzVtdk00c1pCOFlhOWpxdHdwUTY5RkNsRDRINWloVThkLWNsSTBSMUIxaG0yblJGMGlCeXluYWk0ZWREWnRFUkh0SUZmVHVBV0lKSUJBVG1oRUI1SVg3RXdELTlwbVJOX3hLRFA3R3BCNXozQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A South Carolina teenager has died just days after catching a rare bacterial infection, prompting doctors to issue a warning over the symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;William Hand, 14, tragically succumbed to a rare blood infection known as Meningococcemia on June 8 only days after catching the fast-moving illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recent eight grade Hughes Academy of Science and Technology graduate woke up before 5am and was 'clearly not well,' his dad Will Hand wrote on &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10104292851218874&amp;amp;set=pb.33303896.-2207520000&amp;amp;type=3"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Everything snowballed and God called him home,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is how I will always choose to remember Will.

It can also cause a rash that does not fade when pressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We call it a petechial rash because it looks like broken blood vessels underneath the skin,' Burch told the outlet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It’s not a typically rash that you would get with let’s say, a viral infection. If you put your finger on it and press down really hard, the rash will stay there.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Department of Public Health reported 12 cases of the illness in South Carolina in the past 1.5 years, four of which resulted in death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A spokesperson for DHEC told the outlet: 'DPH investigates all reported cases of Neisseria meningitidis, looking for possible links. In regards to the 12 cases spread across the state within 18 months, no links were found and this does not fit the definition of an outbreak.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most effective preventative action against Meningococcemia is vaccination, according to The Centers for Disease Control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hand is remembered as 'the highlight of many people's day-equal parts athlete, comedian, music lover, and loyal friend.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The disease is spread through saliva or respiratory secretions, and can be transferred from person to person through close contact or sharing items such as drinks or utensils&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The little league baseball player was described by his team, Greenville Little League, as 'more than just a great competitor—he was a loyal friend, devoted son and brother, and a true teammate in every sense'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Symptoms include high fever, severe headache, sensitivity to light, nausea, or vomiting.

But when done right, a low-carb lifestyle can be one of the most powerful tools for improving metabolic health, energy and body composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the biggest myths — and what science actually says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. You need carbs for energy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a common myth — and one of the most misleading. Yes, your body can use carbs for energy, but it doesn't require them. Once adapted, your metabolism becomes highly efficient at using fat and ketones for fuel — especially during long-duration activity or fasting periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fat is the body's largest and most reliable energy reserve. When you train your metabolism to use it efficiently, you unlock a level of endurance and energy stability that carbs alone can't offer," said Joel Bikman, a long-time nutrition executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fat-adapted state also supports steady blood sugar and improved mental clarity — benefits that go beyond athletic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Low-carb means no carbs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-carb doesn't mean zero-carb. It simply means reducing refined sugars and starches — not eliminating all carbohydrates. In fact, most low-carb diets encourage nutrient-dense carbs from sources like leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, avocados, and even berries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal isn't to eliminate an entire macronutrient group, it's to prioritize quality over quantity. By focusing on fiber-rich, low-glycemic options, you get the benefits of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, without the blood sugar spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A well-formulated low-carb diet isn't restrictive — it's refined," Bikman said. "It weeds out the junk and prioritizes nutrient-dense foods your body actually thrives on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. You'll feel awful&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some people may experience "keto flu," rest assured that it's temporary. As your body shifts from burning sugar to burning fat, it can experience symptoms like fatigue, brain fog, or irritability for a few days. This is your metabolism recalibrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adaptation isn't a sign something is wrong — it's a sign something is changing," Bikman said. "Hydration, electrolytes, and adequate fat intake can all ease the adjustment period."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you've made the transition, though, most people report dramatically improved energy, reduced hunger, better mood stability, and even clearer thinking. Many say they've never felt better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Julia/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. It's bad for athletes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, conventional wisdom said athletes needed to carb-load for peak performance. But more recent research — especially in endurance sports — is changing that narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some high-intensity athletes may benefit from strategic carbohydrate use, many endurance athletes (cyclists, ultramarathoners, triathletes) report improved stamina and fat oxidation on a low-carb or ketogenic approach. Some even see VO₂ max improvements — a key marker of aerobic capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A flexible metabolism that can switch between fuel sources is now seen as a performance advantage, not a liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. You can't eat fruit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This myth comes from a misunderstanding of the meaning of "low-glycemic." While many fruits are high in sugar, not all fruits are off-limits on a low-carb plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berries — especially raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries — are low in net carbs and packed with antioxidants. Other low-sugar options like kiwi, starfruit, and small portions of melon can also fit in, depending on your goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. It's just another diet fad&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The low-carb diet isn't some Silicon Valley startup trend — it's grounded in decades of scientific research. Studies have consistently shown that low-carb and ketogenic diets improve blood sugar regulation, reduce insulin levels, aid in weight loss, and support better lipid profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The low-carb approach isn't a passing trend," Bikman said. "It's a proven therapeutic tool with decades of data behind it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Diabetes Association recognizes low-carb eating as a valid therapy for managing type 2 diabetes. That's not a fad — that's clinical validation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. It's too restrictive&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, many people find low-carb less restrictive than calorie counting. Why? Because it naturally curbs cravings, stabilizes appetite, and emphasizes real, satisfying food. When you're not on a blood sugar rollercoaster all day, eating becomes simpler and more intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not about eating less," Bikman said. "It's about eating smarter. Low-carb helps people reclaim control over their hunger and their health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A big boost to low-carb&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ideally, we all would have the knowledge, time, discipline and budget to plan, purchase and prepare perfect low-carb meals," Bikman said. "But it simply doesn't happen; people get busy, they get stressed and they make unhealthy choices that derail their health goals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bikman knew that he and his team could be part of the solution to help people achieve their best health more quickly, and especially to assist those that don't always have the time, knowledge or discipline to eat healthy. In response, Bikman and his co-founding team of metabolic, nutrition and industry experts created &lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorial" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;HLTH Code Complete Meal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bikman says these carefully formulated meal shakes are designed to promote healthy weight management, gut health, brain health, even hair, skin and nail health. HLTH Code Complete Meal features an optimized, science-backed blend of protein, collagen, healthy fats, apple cider vinegar, probiotics, fiber, vitamins and minerals — with no added sugar or any artificial ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"HLTH Code Complete Meal is based on research, not fads," Bikman said. "An incredible amount of work went into making this nutritionally balanced and optimized, yet we knew that if it didn't taste good, no one would use them consistently."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: HLTH Code&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Delicious and convenient&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Each HLTH Code Complete Meal shake is packed with optimized amounts of low-carb ingredients to leave you feeling full and energized for hours," said Bikman. "Yet it's more convenient and affordable than virtually any meal you could make or buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bikman says the shakes are quick and easy to make: Just add two scoops of Creamy Vanilla or Chocolate Macadamia Complete Meal Powder to 8 oz. of cold water and shake or blend. For general wellness, he recommends replacing one meal daily. To reset your health or for weight loss, replace up to two meals per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[I've] been using HLTH Code for about two weeks and I feel healthier, having more energy and having less cravings - love this product!!!" wrote &lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/reviews/?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorial" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;one reviewer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reviewer shares, "I started losing weight quickly because I have found that I no longer eat between meals, I do not 'crave' carbs and I'm automatically doing intermittent fasting, not purposely but because I just don't get hungry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet another reviewer shares, "The results have been phenomenal! Thank you HLTH Code. The shakes are yummy but the weight loss results are miraculous."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Making low-carb easier&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Bikman, the best health starts with the right blend of nutrition. Increased energy; feeling more vibrant; a stronger immune system; a clearer mind; improved gut health; and an improved appearance are some of the benefits from improving one's nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The comprehensive benefits of HLTH Code Complete Meal are especially helpful if you're trying to lose weight," Bikman said.

&lt;p&gt;Although most people consume too much salt, some conditions require more salt. However, before increasing your salt intake, Khera emphasized that “these are specialized conditions that require specific expertise,” and that no one should increase their salt intake before having “explicit discussions with their doctor.” The following conditions may require adding salt to one’s diet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orthostatic hypotension. &lt;/strong&gt;Khera explained that if people have low blood pressure when standing up, or orthostatic hypotension, they may need more salt. When a patient is diagnosed with this condition — one variation of which is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome — doctors “sometimes recommend salt to retain more fluid in the body and have fewer dizzy or loss-of-consciousness spells,” Khera said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-performance athletes.&lt;/strong&gt; Khera explained that high-performance athletes may lose a lot of salt via sweat, especially if they are training or competing in hot climates. However, he noted that “this is rarely needed,” and that when it is, “modest increases are sufficient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cystic fibrosis.&lt;/strong&gt; Individuals with cystic fibrosis lose salt through their sweat more than those without the condition, Khera said. That means they “often require an increase in intake in salt,” although the amount of additional salt each person needs varies and is determined by their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addison’s disease.&lt;/strong&gt; According to Batiste, “People with Addison’s disease, a condition affecting the adrenal glands, may experience low levels of sodium.” Health care providers may recommend increased salt intake to maintain electrolyte balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electrolyte abnormalities. &lt;/strong&gt;Some electrolyte abnormalities, such as low blood sodium or hyponatremia, are treated with increased sodium intake. However, these conditions are sometimes treated with reduced fluid intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialysis. &lt;/strong&gt;Some dialysis patients are instructed to increase sodium intake, Khera said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-much-salt-to-eat_l_65aea1d5e4b0be962c82e657" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888388"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The drinks led to a build-up of insulin in the blood, another warning sign that diabetes could set in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And levels of harmful cholesterol and triglycerides – blood fats linked with heart disease – also rose with some types of no or low-alcohol beers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many also have a high calorie content, which can raise the risk of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pub sales of alcohol-free beers hit a record 120million pints in 2023, up 14 per cent from the previous year and a huge 77.8 per cent increase since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The steep rise reflects a marked change in drinking habits, with more and more Britons opting to avoid alcohol in favour of 'healthier' alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is little doubt this approach is better than heavy alcohol consumption for health, the latest study suggests no-alcohol beers are far from harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sales are booming and demand for alcohol-free beers is higher than it has ever been. But now research suggests they are not exactly the health boost many people hope. Pictured: File photo &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists found that drinking two bottles a day is enough to drive up blood sugar levels – increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes. Pictured: File photo &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The drinks led to a build-up of insulin in the blood, another warning sign that diabetes could set in. Pictured: File photo &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists from Germany and the US followed 44 healthy young men who drank either two 330ml bottles of alcohol-free beer or water every day for four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They had regular blood tests to monitor how it affected their bodies. The results, in the journal Nutrients, showed a worrying effect on cardiovascular health. The dangers were greater with booze-free wheat beers and so-called 'mixed beers' – which are often flavoured with orange or lemon soda. Lighter Pilsner-type beers stripped of alcohol, or with a maximum 0.5 per cent alcohol content, were slightly less damaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a report on their findings researchers said: 'Non-alcoholic beer is increasingly consumed as an alternative to alcoholic drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But the benefits and risks are not yet known. We found they have an unfavourable effect on metabolism, mainly driven by their calorie and sugar content.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

"A person who once planned outings or made social calls may simply stop engaging," he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And sadly, loved ones may feel silently hurt by the changes. "It can appear that the person does not care or is depressed when this is not the case," points out &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nymc.edu/som/faculty/amodeo-katherine-d.php" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Katherine D.

Dr. Amodeo shares that the chemical changes and cell losses in parts of the brain associated with motivation can impact a person's desire to participate in activities they once loved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://remo.health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Daniel Lesley, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Daniel Lesley, MD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a board-certified neurologist at Remo Health, says situational factors may also contribute to apathy. "Individuals may feel that everything is so much harder, making it seem 'not worth the effort,'" he explains. "Additionally, they might feel 'useless' or like 'a burden.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to Dr. Amodeo, apathy is associated with several types of dementia, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Apathy's place as a symptom of that fourth one, frontotemporal dementia, has gotten more attention lately. Frontotemporal dementia is often diagnosed early (between the ages of 45 and 65). A &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12252" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2020 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; indicated that apathy could predict frontotemporal dementia years before symptoms start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It may be more commonly associated with frontotemporal dementia because those with this disease typically show changes in personality or mood as an early feature [because of] the function of the frontal lobe of the brain—the part of the brain disproportionately impacted in frontotemporal dementia," Dr. Amodeo says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers also note that apathy predicted a faster decline. "Apathy may be associated with a faster decline in function, because it reduces the person’s ability to adapt and cope with their decreased function," Dr. Lesley explains. "Also, it takes away some of the situations that tend to support cognitive health—social activities, exercise, cognitive activities like reading, and getting adequate nutrition and good sleep."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/people-90s-sharp-memory-eat-162500110.html" data-ylk="slk:People in Their 90s With a Sharp Memory Eat This One Food Every Day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;People in Their 90s With a Sharp Memory Eat This One Food Every Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Common Signs of Apathy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Lesley explains that apathy is not a condition but rather a description of a feeling, or lack thereof. He reveals that common signs of apathy include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Loss of interest or joy in things that used to be fun&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Less motivation to do things (even those that are important for survival, like paying bills or eating)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Less Goal-directed activity can all be associated with apathy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Loss of motivation to participate in self-care, including personal and home hygiene (not brushing teeth or cleaning the home)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, neurologists say it's important to understand that apathy has &lt;em&gt;numerous&lt;/em&gt; triggers. If you or a loved one is experiencing apathy, it may not be dementia. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/16-common-phrases-unhappy-people-004000724.html" data-ylk="slk:16 Common Phrases Unhappy People Often Use Without Realizing It, Psychologists Say;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;16 Common Phrases Unhappy People Often Use Without Realizing It, Psychologists Say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Just because a person seems apathetic, they may not necessarily have dementia or be at risk for dementia," Dr. Amodeo says. "It can be observed in other [conditions], such as depression. A diagnosis of dementia would not be based on having this one feature alone."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Dr. Amodeo, additional symptoms that signify that the apathy might be connected to dementia include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Gradual and progressive changes in cognitive function, including memory, language, attention and focus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hallucinations or delusions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sleep changes, such as insomnia or dream enactment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Changes in confusion or alertness (Dr. Amodeo explains a person might be confused later in the day, which is called "sundowning")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mood or personality changes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/subtle-behavior-change-could-early-142500456.html" data-ylk="slk:This Subtle Behavior Change Could Be an Early Sign of Dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;This Subtle Behavior Change Could Be an Early Sign of Dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What To Do if You're Concerned&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts say speaking to a primary care physician is a great start. If they're concerned about cognitive decline, they'll order testing to learn more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Carlisle notes that there is no cure for dementia, but there is hope. "There are medications aimed at treating the symptoms," she explains. "There are a number of lifestyle modifications that can slow cognitive decline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She shares that these shifts include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Regular moderate-level exercise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Following a Mediterranean-style diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Participating in socially and cognitively engaging activities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Getting high-quality sleep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Treating vision and hearing issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A dementia diagnosis can be hard on someone (and worsen apathy). Additionally, apathy may be a sign of a mental health condition exclusively. Either way, Dr. Amodeo shares that you deserve support for your mental well-being. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I would recommend reaching out to their provider, such as their primary care provider, who may refer them to a psychiatrist or psychologist," she says, adding that Psychology Today is a good resource for finding therapists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/six-lifestyle-changes-lower-dementia-162500916.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: These 6 Simple Lifestyle Tweaks Can Lower Dementia Risk by 18%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: These 6 Simple Lifestyle Tweaks Can Lower Dementia Risk by 18%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Sources:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-dementia-symptom-according-to-neurologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Silent Symptom Most People Don't Realize Could Be a Dementia Sign, According to Neurologists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Silent Symptom Most People Don't Realize Could Be a Dementia Sign, According to Neurologists&lt;/a&gt;

                                        With Robert F. Kennedy at the helm of the nation's health agencies, alternative therapies are finding their way more often into the spotlight, including one familiar from the pandemic: ivermectin. Republican lawmakers in multiple states are now pushing bills that would allow for the antiparasitic to be sold over the counter, and four states already boast such a law: Arkansas, Tennessee, Idaho, and Louisiana, report &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ivermectin-over-counter-pharmacy-states-rfk-jr-rcna205616"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nola.com/news/healthcare_hospitals/ivermectin-louisiana-law/article_e7dac5b2-f9cb-4e21-965a-6d917e38e9ab.html"&gt;NOLA&lt;/a&gt;. The move to make ivermectin OTC doesn't come without controversy: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What it is:&lt;/strong&gt; The drug began as a veterinary med in the '70s, before being approved by the FDA to use for serious tropical diseases like river blindness, as well as scabies, tapeworms, and other worm-linked illnesses.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;FDA:&lt;/strong&gt; The agency hasn't given the green light for ivermectin to be used as a COVID preventive measure or treatment, and clinical trials haven't offered evidence that ivermectin does the trick on either of those fronts. The FDA has warned that ivermectin could interact with other meds, and that ODs can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, seizures, and even death.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;

"This stuff works, man," Gibson said, per the &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/us/news-today/article/ivermectin-cancer-cure-antivaxers-fbbqpm86g"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of London.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;More bills: &lt;/strong&gt;GOP lawmakers in at least a dozen other states are trying to jump-start their own related legislation, including in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and West Virginia.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Access: &lt;/strong&gt;The ivermectin would likely remain behind the pharmacist's counter, even if one doesn't need an Rx to buy it. Some pharmacists are also wary at using the drug off-label for illnesses and conditions it hasn't been approved for. One Idaho pharmacist tells NBC that he won't sell it to just anyone until the FDA weighs in with more guidance, despite his state recently approving ivermectin for OTC status.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Merck:&lt;/strong&gt; The company that manufactures ivermectin in the US says in a statement that the medication should only be used as the FDA directs it to be used, noting, "The use of ivermectin is not supported beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information."&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; Much more &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ivermectin-over-counter-pharmacy-states-rfk-jr-rcna205616"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; on the controversy.

However, elephants, whales and other large animals tend to have lower cancer rates than humans, according to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/this-gene-stops-elephants-from-getting-cancer-can-it-help-human-cancer-research/" target="_blank" title="https://bgr.com/science/this-gene-stops-elephants-from-getting-cancer-can-it-help-human-cancer-research/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;BGR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2456041" target="_blank" title="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2456041" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;In a 2015 study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;BGR&lt;/em&gt; reported that researchers discovered that elephants possess 19 extra copies of the TP53 gene, a powerful cancer-stopping gene that acts as a genetic safeguard by detecting DNA damage and triggering cell death in potentially cancerous cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This genetic advantage likely explains elephants' low cancer rates despite their size, according to &lt;em&gt;BGR&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aacr.org/about-the-aacr/newsroom/news-releases/cancer-prevalence-across-vertebrate-species-decreases-with-gestation-time-may-increase-with-adult-mass/" target="_blank" title="https://www.aacr.org/about-the-aacr/newsroom/news-releases/cancer-prevalence-across-vertebrate-species-decreases-with-gestation-time-may-increase-with-adult-mass/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;A new study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;BGR&lt;/em&gt; reported expanded this research to nearly 300 animal species, analyzing over 16,000 necropsy records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed that elephants are not unique in their cancer resistance. Many other species including some birds, bats and lizards, also exhibit low cancer levels, while animals like ferrets and opossums have higher rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study highlighted that larger body mass was linked to a slightly higher cancer risk, though not as strongly as anticipated, &lt;em&gt;BGR&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications for human cancer research are significant, according to &lt;em&gt;BGR&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While humans have only two copies of the TP53 gene, understanding how elephants and other species bolster their cancer defenses could lead to new treatments that enhance human cell resilience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BGR reported that researchers hope mimicking or boosting the effects of this gene could help develop therapies to reduce cancer incidence or slow its progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WKRC</author><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2025 20:52:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAJBVV95cUxPRmkzRUJoMWpGVlNqblZCZTlRTmtfUHpPVXVxNWJSMERBbEdabjl5X3IyVjAzdHFUakZnVDBBQzVBdzFvRHo0SVpBSk95UTlfTjFhcHc5YlRGMGNMV0pqNDluT3FPQkl6TnI3TjVTSXVySkdpOTZXR1dsOXNJczVMb3N5XzRtXzg2MEQ1b3BhUVlyS0ZLLTNLWnp3RnZMclBQb2lKSElGOWE1ZV9rVlhpZ2VlQVVrWFNmUkl1N1ItOXY5VWJLbXNod2cwQk1VVFYxRjRmSjFFVXdJdG94LU1DSUp0TndsLUNjN0VsMzJpSmk1bndWM1hJQ00xOUdvdU96dmVhN05GdTlCWURoZHg3c0RrUVdMcV96bEowTnZsUjRHRGs4ZEJ1UjRqR1p4b1ktaEZ1TkhWZEE</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，在美国这5个州，美国老年人最快乐，您是其中之一吗？ -雅虎 | Older Americans are happiest living in these 5 US states, study says — is yours one of them? - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxQbW5KWTF1UEpjd2xfZ0ZZZHd2RVdBOVFPSEY2NWVFQVlnTWRsdkRvOUVsdEZNNXh6YVFYZjZPczdnM05hTEw5VDBOajNiTnZla1NUWlpBVUZ5TUk2WXc3T2pEd2VzTGRlZ25lb3Q2b3lzbnhlbzNkU0hrTnRtNlEyVk1zc0xQNVRyTFpfUjVOYnNuMTA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of the great perks of reaching your golden years is the newfound freedom to live wherever you choose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With the kids out of the house and work no longer tying you down, retirement opens the door to relocating to a place that better suits your lifestyle.

Utah&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Utah tops the list as a retirement haven for older adults. According to Caring.com, the state with a score of 7.69 out of 10 on the Senior Happiness Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This score is based primarily on the state’s supportive environment for people in this age cohort. Seniors are more healthy, less isolated and more likely to be engaged in community volunteer work here, which makes retirement much more satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: Want an extra $1,300,000 when you retire?

According to ElderLife Financial, senior care in Utah tends to &lt;a href="https://moneywise.com/go?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elderlifefinancial.com%2Fcost-of-care%2Fcost-of-senior-care-utah%2F&amp;amp;utm_medium=EL" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cost more;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;cost more&lt;/a&gt; than the national average, with a typical assisted living facility costing $4,150 per month, as of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nevertheless, if you’re wealthier or more &lt;a href="https://moneywise.com/managing-money/retirement-planning/vg-heres-how-much-the-typical-baby-boomer-has-saved?utm_source=syn_oath_mon&amp;amp;utm_medium=WL&amp;amp;utm_campaign=106532&amp;amp;utm_content=syn_7aeee603-8ef7-4605-bb53-cedba9f14c46" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:financially secure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;financially secure&lt;/a&gt; than the average retiree, this might be an ideal state to retire in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;2. Idaho&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Idaho is second on Caring.com’s index, scoring 7.38 out of 10. Again, this is based on the density of seniors in the state and the access to senior services and support resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fortunately, Idaho is also considered a &lt;a href="https://moneywise.com/go?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsmartasset.com%2Fretirement%2Fretirement-taxes&amp;amp;utm_medium=EL" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tax-friendly state;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;tax-friendly state&lt;/a&gt; for older Americans, according to SmartAsset, which means you can expect no taxes on your Social Security benefits and relatively lower sales and property taxes, &lt;a href="https://moneywise.com/managing-money/how-to-earn-money/5-money-moves-to-make-now?utm_source=syn_oath_mon&amp;amp;utm_medium=WL&amp;amp;utm_campaign=106532&amp;amp;utm_content=syn_41e7fa8c-3d42-443d-8b16-9618de53c19b" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:saving;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;saving&lt;/a&gt; you money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;3. Connecticut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Connecticut ranks third on the Senior Happiness Index, scoring 7.01 out of 10. The state has the third-highest life expectancy and is in the top 10 for overall health. So if you’re trying to live long and stay fit in retirement, this could be an ideal destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unfortunately, according to SmartAsset, the state is a relatively unfriendly tax jurisdiction for seniors. This means you may have little to no tax benefits for retirement income and could be exposed to relatively high property and inheritance taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The cost of living is noticeably higher here. According to Senior Living, a typical retiree can expect to &lt;a href="https://moneywise.com/go?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.seniorliving.org%2Findependent-living%2Fcosts%2F&amp;amp;utm_medium=EL" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:spend;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;spend&lt;/a&gt; $4,661 to live independently in Connecticut, 52% higher than the national average, according to Senior Living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;4. Delaware&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Delaware ties with Connecticut with a score of 7.01 out of 10, and ranks ninth for health outcomes. It is in the top five states with the lowest ratio of older adults living alone, which means you’re less vulnerable to social isolation here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Delaware is also tax-friendly to seniors, according to SmartAsset. The average monthly cost of living independently here is $3,862, which Senior Living reports is just 26% above the national average.

"It’s convenient, it’s effective, and it may help close the gap for patients who’ve run out of options."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study — which was funded by NewAmsterdam Pharma, a developer of Obicetrapib that is based in the Netherlands — did have some limitations, the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Obicetrapib was found to be "well-tolerated" by the participants, the researchers noted. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the participants were not chosen based on high Lp(a), which means the study did not determine how the drug impacted those with elevated levels of the protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the study assessed changes in LDL levels, but did not measure actual &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;heart attack or stroke&lt;/a&gt; outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;More studies&lt;/a&gt; are needed to follow patients for longer time periods and to include more diverse cohorts, the researchers acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to the researchers for additional comment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="article-meta"&gt;&lt;div class="author-bio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melissa Rudy is senior health editor and a member of the lifestyle team at Fox News Digital.

							&lt;p data-start="108" data-end="427"&gt;Last Tuesday I caught myself with 17 browser tabs open, over-optimizing a dog-food subscription. Fifteen minutes later my coffee was cold, my shoulders were up to my ears, and—ironically—the dog still hadn’t eaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="108" data-end="427"&gt;That little spiral is the signature move of overthinking: maximum mental spin, minimal forward motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="429" data-end="1030"&gt;Overthinking isn’t a moral failing; it’s what happens when a brain built for saber-tooth threats tries to calibrate every modern micro-choice—from comparison-shopping toothbrush heads to deciding which meditation app has the “best” background chime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="429" data-end="1030"&gt;The real art lies in clearing enough cognitive desk space to keep decisions practical, emotions settled, and life—well—liveable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="429" data-end="1030"&gt;Below are seven research-backed moves I lean on whenever my mind threatens to behave like a runaway spreadsheet. Each one trades rumination for simple action so you can exit the mental roundabout and actually hit the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1037" data-end="1060"&gt;1. Shrink the menu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1062" data-end="1464"&gt;Colleagues once joked I could model a cost–benefit ratio for choosing a pen. It turns out the brain genuinely dislikes a buffet of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1062" data-end="1464"&gt;In a landmark field experiment, Columbia University researchers set up a jam-tasting booth: when shoppers &lt;a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/jdb/345/345%20Articles/Iyengar%20%26%20Lepper%20%282000%29.pdf?.com"&gt;faced 24 flavours&lt;/a&gt;, only 3 % bought a jar; with six flavours, purchases jumped to 30 %—a ten-fold difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1466" data-end="1809"&gt;The reason is cognitive bandwidth. Every extra comparison inflates the decision tree and drains willpower reserves we need for truly consequential choices. Psychologist Roy Baumeister calls the phenomenon &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6119549/?.com"&gt;decision fatigue&lt;/a&gt;—the more mini-decisions you make, the weaker subsequent self-control becomes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1811" data-end="2113"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1811" data-end="1831"&gt;Practical pivot:&lt;/strong&gt; give yourself a &lt;em data-start="1848" data-end="1865"&gt;decision budget&lt;/em&gt;. Three viable options, ten minutes of research, then lock it. You’ll spend the reclaimed energy on things that actually move the satisfaction needle—like finally emailing Grandma those vacation photos instead of refreshing yet another review site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2120" data-end="2148"&gt;2. Dump the mental tabs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2150" data-end="2572"&gt;Imagine your mind as a browser and rumination as 47 auto-play videos. Offload them. A Michigan State study had chronic worriers &lt;a href="https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2017/for-worriers-expressive-writing-cools-brain-on-stressful-tasks?.com"&gt;hand-write their anxieties for eight minutes&lt;/a&gt; before tackling a difficult task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2150" data-end="2572"&gt;Brain-wave scans showed they performed just as accurately as controls but with significantly less neural effort—like closing memory-hungry apps before launching Photoshop. &lt;span class="" data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"&gt;&lt;a class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out" href="https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2017/for-worriers-expressive-writing-cools-brain-on-stressful-tasks?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"&gt;&lt;span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden"&gt;&lt;span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center"&gt;msutoday.msu.edu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2574" data-end="2924"&gt;My nightly ritual is a two-column spreadsheet: one column for every uncensored, half-baked worry; the other labelled Action / Archive / Absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2574" data-end="2924"&gt;Seeing thoughts in cells strips them of backstage mystery; half get the “Absurd” stamp and evaporate overnight. The goal isn’t literary merit—it’s exporting rumination so your working memory can reboot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2931" data-end="2959"&gt;3. Flip worry into WOOP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2961" data-end="3352"&gt;Overthinking often disguises itself as planning but skips a crucial step: confronting obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2961" data-end="3352"&gt;Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen developed the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8893137/?.com"&gt;WOOP method&lt;/a&gt;—Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan—showing that pairing positive visualisation with &lt;em data-start="3199" data-end="3208"&gt;if-then&lt;/em&gt; contingency plans dramatically boosts follow-through on everything from healthy eating to study habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2961" data-end="3352"&gt;Here’s the applied math:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="3382" data-end="3575"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="3382" data-end="3428"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3384" data-end="3428"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3384" data-end="3393"&gt;Wish:&lt;/strong&gt; “Clear my inbox flags by 5 p.m.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="3429" data-end="3468"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3431" data-end="3468"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3431" data-end="3443"&gt;Outcome:&lt;/strong&gt; “Evenings feel light.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="3469" data-end="3514"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3471" data-end="3514"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3471" data-end="3484"&gt;Obstacle:&lt;/strong&gt; “Slack pings hijack focus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="3515" data-end="3575"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3517" data-end="3575"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3517" data-end="3526"&gt;Plan:&lt;/strong&gt; “If Slack opens, then mute it for 30 minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3577" data-end="3799"&gt;Mapping the obstacle tightens the loop from abstract worry to concrete trigger → response. It’s like fermentation: introduce a helpful “obstacle culture” and raw worry turns into flavour instead of souring the whole batch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3806" data-end="3862"&gt;4. Breathe like a barista—slow, intentional, frothy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3864" data-end="4204"&gt;Breath is the only lever that plugs straight into both body and mind. Stanford Medicine researchers found that &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2023/02/cyclic-sighing-can-help-breathe-away-anxiety.html?.com"&gt;five minutes a day of “cyclic sighing”&lt;/a&gt;—a double inhale through the nose followed by a long, slow mouth exhale—reduced anxiety more than mindfulness meditation or normal paced breathing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4206" data-end="4547"&gt;Physiologically, elongated exhales cue the vagus nerve to shift the body from fight-or-flight to rest-and-digest. My hack: cue the pattern to music—inhale on a four-beat pickup, exhale through the chorus. When the song ends, so does the exercise. It feels less like a “technique” and more like letting the playlist steer your nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4554" data-end="4595"&gt;5. Label, don’t wrestle, the thought&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4597" data-end="5009"&gt;Rumination thrives on vagueness; slap a label on it and the spell breaks. Mindfulness meta-analyses show significant drops in repetitive negative thinking among participants who practice &lt;em data-start="4784" data-end="4807"&gt;non-judgmental naming&lt;/em&gt; of thoughts and feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4597" data-end="5009"&gt;Instead of “What if I bomb the presentation?” try: “Planning anxiety, noted.” The label recruits your prefrontal cortex—your internal project manager—reducing limbic hijack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5011" data-end="5153"&gt;Think of it like flagging emails: once tagged, a monster thread shrinks to a tidy folder and stops pinging your mental inbox every 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5160" data-end="5188"&gt;6. Automate the trivial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5190" data-end="5534"&gt;Overthinkers burn premium fuel on sub-premium tasks: &lt;em data-start="5243" data-end="5276"&gt;Which shirt? Which font weight?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5190" data-end="5534"&gt;Decision fatigue studies show that high achievers guard cognitive resources by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6119549/?.com"&gt;routinising the bottom 20 % of choices&lt;/a&gt;—Mark Zuckerberg’s grey T-shirts, Barack Obama’s two-suit rotation, my Tuesday/Thursday oatmeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5536" data-end="5586"&gt;Habit scaffolding turns defaults into autopilot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="5587" data-end="5732"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5587" data-end="5636"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5589" data-end="5636"&gt;Breakfast = oats + berries, five days a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5637" data-end="5678"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5639" data-end="5678"&gt;Workout = 7 a.m. on calendar invites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5679" data-end="5732"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5681" data-end="5732"&gt;Invoices = last calendar day, recurring reminder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5734" data-end="5895"&gt;It’s the cognitive equivalent of putting recurring expenses on auto-pay: mental 401(k) contributions that compound into creative liquidity when you need it most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5902" data-end="5938"&gt;7. Set “good-enough” thresholds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5940" data-end="6226"&gt;Financial models rely on satisficing—stopping once returns level off. Life decisions can too. Instead of evaluating infinity, create a checklist that defines &lt;em data-start="6102" data-end="6108"&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;: “Airbnb rating ≥ 4.7, within budget, Wi-Fi &amp;gt; 50 Mbps.” Once a place hits the spec sheet, click &lt;em data-start="6205" data-end="6211"&gt;Book&lt;/em&gt; and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6228" data-end="6588"&gt;Why it matters: a 2025 Nature portfolio study&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-03783-1?.com"&gt; linked maladaptive perfectionism to increased loneliness&lt;/a&gt; and depressive symptoms, highlighting how endless self-critique undercuts wellbeing. &lt;span class="" data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"&gt;&lt;a class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-03783-1?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"&gt;&lt;span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden"&gt;&lt;span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center"&gt;nature.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A clear threshold is gate security for your mental stadium—after requirements are met, no extra thoughts get in, especially not worry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6595" data-end="6611"&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6613" data-end="6861"&gt;Overthinking feels productive because it &lt;em data-start="6654" data-end="6660"&gt;uses&lt;/em&gt; energy—like a treadmill desk for cognition. But left unchecked it converts that energy into heat, not motion. The seven moves above reclaim choice architecture, sensory grounding, and goal friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6863" data-end="7262"&gt;&lt;em data-start="6863" data-end="6880"&gt;Shrink the menu&lt;/em&gt; trims excess branches from decision trees. &lt;em data-start="6924" data-end="6945"&gt;Dumping mental tabs&lt;/em&gt; frees processing power. &lt;em data-start="6970" data-end="6976"&gt;WOOP&lt;/em&gt; welds wishes to plans. &lt;em data-start="7000" data-end="7016"&gt;Cyclic sighing&lt;/em&gt; tells your nervous system the sabre-tooth has gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6863" data-end="7262"&gt;&lt;em data-start="7069" data-end="7089"&gt;Labelling thoughts&lt;/em&gt; keeps them from starring in an endless sequel. &lt;em data-start="7137" data-end="7149"&gt;Automation&lt;/em&gt; protects prime fuel for high-leverage tasks. And &lt;em data-start="7199" data-end="7223"&gt;good-enough thresholds&lt;/em&gt; lock the exit door on perfectionism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7264" data-end="7458"&gt;Try one this week; stack another next. Happiness isn’t the absence of thought—it’s the presence of thoughts that finish their shift, clock out, and leave you the keys to a quieter, clearer mind.&lt;/p&gt;

Symptoms usually develop within seven to 14 days after exposure, although they can appear as long as 21 days after exposure. The second stage of measles, according to health officials, begins three to five days after symptoms start, when a rash appears on the face and spreads to other parts of the body. People with measles are contagious from four days before the rash appears through four days after the rash appeared, according to Virginia health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="G2CVD2XZXZGFVHCT6TCE3GA73A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you have received two doses of a &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/measles/" target="_blank"&gt;measles-containing vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, or were born before 1957, you are protected and do not need to take any action, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="475LQ4D5W5GZDGW4YXABPEIK7Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Anyone who thinks they might have been exposed and are not immune, or who thinks they are at risk of developing measles, should contact their health-care provider, officials said.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most Americans fall short on their fiber intake, which can lead to constipation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A dinner rich in fiber and other gut-friendly nutrients can help you poop in the morning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our top pick: a dinner loaded with plant-based proteins and fiber from chickpeas, cauliflower and whole grains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We’ve seen plenty of aspirational morning routines on social media. Many people like to start the day with meditation, journaling, hot tea or working out—but what about a morning poop? While talking about poop as part of your morning routine may be too cringy to share online, staying regular is just as important for your overall health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If having a regular morning No. 2 feels as out of reach as 10 minutes of uninterrupted meditation time in the morning, you may benefit from making a few tweaks to your diet. Eating a diet low in fiber is linked with constipation, a common gastrointestinal condition. In fact, 15% of the U.S. population struggles with chronic constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; There are several reasons for constipation, and inadequate dietary fiber is one of them. After all, more than 90% of American women and 97% of American men don’t meet recommendations for daily fiber intake.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating a fiber-rich dinner at night can set you up for a regular morning poop. Here’s why: Your digestive system slows down when you go to sleep, so filling up with fiber at dinner gives that fiber a chance to do the work of softening and bulking up your stool. In the morning, your colon tends to become more active, meaning it’s primed and ready for a poop.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Not to mention, dinner is a great opportunity to pack in some extra fiber so that you’re hitting the recommended 22 to 34 grams of fiber per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Read on to find out our top dinner pick that may help you poop in the A.M.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look For &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Opt for Plant-Based Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you’re feeling backed up, choosing a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291111/the-10-best-vegan-protein-sources/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based protein&lt;/a&gt; at dinner may be just what you need to get things moving again. Beans and legumes are great sources of protein, and they are also high in fiber, an essential nutrient that isn’t found in chicken, beef and fish. Not only that, most types of beans and lentils contain a combination of both soluble and insoluble fiber, which support regularity in different ways. Just a half-cup of cooked black beans contains 8 grams of fiber, over a quarter of your daily fiber needs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Legumes also provide a host of other beneficial nutrients that support a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthier gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Pack in Some Whole Grains &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sneak in a few extra grams of fiber by choosing a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031247/healthy-whole-grains-to-eat-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole grain&lt;/a&gt; for your starch with dinner. Research has found that whole grain eaters were less likely to report constipation, so this relatively simple swap could potentially get things moving again.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, a small study that included women with functional constipation found that their symptoms improved when eating whole grains or brown rice over four weeks versus a diet with white rice.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Incorporate Non-Starchy Vegetables &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not only are non-starchy vegetables good sources of fiber, but they're also &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/antioxidant-rich-anti-inflammatory-meal-plan-8680682" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; that quench the free radicals that can contribute to inflammation. Inflammation increases your risk of many chronic diseases and may also &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7944613/inflammation-might-be-the-reason-you-cant-poop-heres-what-to-do-about-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lead to constipation&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, non-starchy veggies contain vitamins and minerals to support your overall health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are looking for a flavor-packed dinner that will also help you poop in the morning, we recommend &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/roasted-chickpea-cauliflower-pitas-with-sun-dried-tomato-sauce-8609745" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Roasted Chickpea &amp;amp; Cauliflower Pitas with Sun-Dried Tomato Sauce&lt;/a&gt;. Here is why it’s the best choice. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Rich in Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hitting the mark on your fiber intake for the day will be easy when you make these pitas for dinner, since they provide a whopping 13 grams of fiber. Chickpeas, cauliflower and whole-grain pitas all add to the total fiber count for this meal. Including legumes also ensures you’ll be eating a good balance of both soluble&lt;em&gt; and&lt;/em&gt; insoluble fiber for healthy poops. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Packed with Pre- and Probiotics &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These pitas are doubly beneficial for gut health since they provide both prebiotics and probiotics. Prebiotics provide fuel for the beneficial bacteria that live in your gut. One excellent source of prebiotics is chickpeas, which serve as the main protein source in these delicious pitas.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yogurt, tahini and sun-dried tomatoes combine into a flavor-packed sauce that is also rich in probiotics thanks to the yogurt. Probiotic-rich foods help maintain a healthy balance of beneficial versus harmful bacteria in the gut. A small study of participants with constipation found that eating yogurt reduced constipation symptoms and helped improve the types of bacteria in their gut.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Anti-Inflammatory Ingredients &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although fruits and vegetables are usually the first thing we think of when it comes to anti-inflammatory foods, don’t overlook the spices in your pantry. Cumin and turmeric give the cauliflower in these pitas tons of flavor and provide an antioxidant boost, too. The bioactive compound in turmeric called curcumin may be particularly helpful for lowering inflammation by blocking the production of cytokines, which are compounds that trigger inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although there is no &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-time-of-the-day-to-poop-8642393" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;best time of day to poop&lt;/a&gt;, starting your day off with a morning poop may be a habit that helps you feel good. A key factor to setting yourself up for a poop after breakfast? A high-fiber dinner like these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/roasted-chickpea-cauliflower-pitas-with-sun-dried-tomato-sauce-8609745" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Roasted Chickpea &amp;amp; Cauliflower Pitas with Sun-Dried Tomato Sauce&lt;/a&gt;. Not only are they loaded with flavor and fiber, they also provide other gut-friendly nutrients, such as probiotics, prebiotics and antioxidants, to support gut health.

Conventional thrombectomy has a very low efficacy rate because of this imprecision, and the procedure can result in pieces of the clot breaking off and moving to more difficult-to-reach regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thrombectomy via milli-spinner also enters the brain with a catheter, but instead of using a normal vacuum device, it employs a spinning tube outfitted with fins and slits that can suck up the clot much more meticulously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stanford neuroimaging expert Jeremy Heit, who also coauthored a new paper about the device &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09049-0" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, explained in the school's press release that the efficacy of the milli-spinner is "unbelievable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For most cases, we’re more than doubling the efficacy of current technology, and for the toughest clots — which we’re only removing about 11 percent of the time with current devices — we’re getting the artery open on the first try 90 percent of the time," Heit said. "This is a sea-change technology that will drastically improve our ability to help people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renee Zhao, the senior author of the &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; paper who teaches mechanical engineering at Stanford and creates what she calls "millirobots," said that conventional thrombectomies just aren't cutting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With existing technology, there’s no way to reduce the size of the clot," Zhao said. "They rely on deforming and rupturing the clot to remove it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What’s unique about the milli-spinner is that it applies compression and shear forces to shrink the entire clot," she continued, "dramatically reducing the volume without causing rupture."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as the team discovered, the device can cut and vacuum up to five percent of its original size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It works so well, for a wide range of clot compositions and sizes," Zhao said. "Even for tough... clots, which are impossible to treat with current technologies, our milli-spinner can treat them using this simple yet powerful mechanics concept to densify the fibrin network and shrink the clot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though its main experimental use case is brain clot removal, Zhao is excited about its other uses, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We’re exploring other biomedical applications for the milli-spinner design, and even possibilities beyond medicine," the engineer said. "There are some very exciting opportunities ahead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on brains:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/microplastics-brain-mental-health" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Microplastics in Your Brain May Be Causing Mental Health Issues&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>futurism.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2025 16:45:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiYkFVX3lxTE5nb1dRMkJ3b0lLX2hTUkdfZ2N5QTZyUTkyLXFLWkJ4WVVqeFlKVUoyVHM3Nm5KOENyY1RQZGQ0TXF2NmhJMjNhODVRVXVCUXA4cENlczNsR3V3S2QwRUJJUkVn</guid></item><item><title>如果您想在接下来的60天内成为一个更平静、压力更小的人，请开始练习这7个日常习惯- VegOut | If you want to be a calmer and less stressed person in the next 60 days, start practicing these 7 daily habits - VegOut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3wFBVV95cUxOdExoU3ZrNmxzSU1acFg2Y05xLXJRNWttZ0hGbXN2OGdRUWdxTWl5cUJBSlIzRnU3ejIyQnZ5YmJnM09VUnJWSll2ZXMzYmx2M01kZGRlYVRSZGtMRlkyVEJ1cWZVRTlTSkFabnI0ZHJBeVhXaUFMVEtVaVc3ZnpNRlRvM1FIdWc5Y28xV2FmV2JGc01SMUZuQ2FjaVdQQWEzQktTN1BDQlJwVFRfRHB0SHZ6MTVxSTJmbG5xSUJ0X3U4Z1l4RkgwX2E4dTRjSlIzeVVGTnNVdHBaN1k5LXNv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="179" data-end="681"&gt;Sixty days is the perfect “fermentation window.” Leave kombucha for that long and the sharp, acidic bite softens into something rounder and quietly bubbly. Our nervous system can mellow in much the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="179" data-end="681"&gt;Given a simple, consistent routine, the jangling notes of everyday pressure start to dissolve into a baseline that feels spacious and clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="179" data-end="681"&gt;Below are seven deliberately small habits—think tablespoons of starter culture—that can guide your own mind-body brew toward calm in the next two months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="688" data-end="744"&gt;1. Start every morning with a 4-7-8 breathing reset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="746" data-end="1612"&gt;Roll to a seated position before your phone lights up, exhale through the mouth, then inhale through the nose for four counts, hold for seven, and release for eight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="746" data-end="1612"&gt;Four slow rounds are enough to feel a tangible drop in heart rate. The pause in the middle invites the vagus nerve to lengthen its “rest and digest” wiring, and the long exhale gives carbon dioxide more time to nudge blood vessels open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="746" data-end="1612"&gt;A 2022 meta-analysis that pooled twenty randomized trials found breath-work practices like this delivered a medium reduction in both &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-27247-y?.com"&gt;perceived stress and anxiety scores&lt;/a&gt;, even when daily sessions lasted just five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="746" data-end="1612"&gt;Picture it as tapping the brake pedal on your body’s fight-or-flight engine before the day even starts. Over a two-month stretch, those micro-brakes add up to miles of nervous-system fuel you did not burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1619" data-end="1672"&gt;2. Slip outside for a ten-minute nature pit stop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1674" data-end="2463"&gt;Sometime between morning emails and lunch, step onto the balcony or a tree-lined sidewalk. Leave the podcast indoors and give your senses a single assignment: notice one shade of green until the minute hand completes a circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1674" data-end="2463"&gt;The first few outings might feel underwhelming, yet repetition trains the reticular activating system (your brain’s “spotlight operator”) to search for gentle cues rather than potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1674" data-end="2463"&gt;A 2024 meta-analysis in &lt;em data-start="2120" data-end="2135"&gt;Ecopsychology&lt;/em&gt; concluded that as little as ten minutes of outdoor exposure reliably &lt;a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/eco.2023.0063?.com"&gt;lowered stress scores and lifted mood&lt;/a&gt;, reviewing data sets that ranged across three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1674" data-end="2463"&gt;Ten minutes sounds trivial, but think of it like adding fresh herbs to a simmering stew. The dose is small, the aroma expansive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2470" data-end="2525"&gt;3. Keep a three-line gratitude ledger before lunch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2527" data-end="3354"&gt;Right after your midday snack, grab a sticky note and write three quick sentences: one thing you finished, one person you appreciate, and one sensory delight you caught (the almond crunch in your granola counts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2527" data-end="3354"&gt;The micro-format matters; it prevents the exercise from turning into another perfectionist obligation. Gratitude journaling is more than a mood exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2527" data-end="3354"&gt;In a study of pregnant participants, those who logged gratitude four times a week for three weeks showed &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1871519216301755?.com"&gt;lower waking and bedtime cortisol&lt;/a&gt; than control groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2527" data-end="3354"&gt;Cortisol is a helpful morning spark, yet chronically high levels delay the body’s evening wind-down. Lower readings at both ends of the day translate into steadier emotional capacitance, like reducing the static hiss on an old cassette so you can hear the melody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3361" data-end="3409"&gt;4. Move in a ten-minute micro-workout burst&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3411" data-end="4214"&gt;Set a countdown timer, then walk the hallway at power-window-shopping pace, do a body-weight circuit, or flow through a gentle stretch sequence. Quit while you still feel “light,” no post-workout shower required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3411" data-end="4214"&gt;Harvard Health reviewers note that modest aerobic spurts&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/exercising-to-relax?.com"&gt; trim adrenaline and cortisol&lt;/a&gt;, while simultaneously boosting endorphins, the brain’s built-in soothing syrup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3411" data-end="4214"&gt;Endorphins are behind the runner’s high, yet you do not need mileage to get the chemistry. Ten focused minutes is enough to tilt the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3411" data-end="4214"&gt;Physically, these bursts act like stirring a kombucha mother—the gentle agitation keeps colonies from clumping. Psychologically, every mini-session is a moving “yes” that chips away at the story that you “never have time” to care for your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4221" data-end="4260"&gt;5. Monotask with a 25-5 focus loop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4262" data-end="5073"&gt;Choose a cognitively juicy assignment, silence notifications, and give it twenty-five uninterrupted minutes. When the timer chimes, stand up for five, stretch, sip water, or stare out a window, then plunge back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4262" data-end="5073"&gt;Laboratory experiments that measured heart-rate variability and skin conductance show that multitasking &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8824354/?.com"&gt;spikes sympathetic nervous-system activity&lt;/a&gt;—your sweat glands fire as if you are jogging despite sitting at a desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4262" data-end="5073"&gt;Single-tasking shrinks that spike, and the scheduled pause acts like a pressure valve so mental lactic acid does not accumulate. Over sixty days, these cycles become rehearsal for holding attention on one thing at a time, a practice suspiciously similar to formal mindfulness but wrapped in productivity clothing. Fewer tabs, less cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5080" data-end="5128"&gt;6. Draw a digital sunset an hour before bed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5130" data-end="5982"&gt;Pick a nightly curfew for screens—many people start with 9 p.m.—and treat it the way an airport enforces a flight cutoff. Phones onto airplane mode, laptops closed, tablet elsewhere. Replace the glow with something analog: gentle yoga, tomorrow’s coffee prep, or low-light journaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5130" data-end="5982"&gt;A Norwegian cohort study published in early 2025 reported that even one hour of screen exposure at bedtime &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/screen-time-bedtime-insomnia-risk?.com"&gt;raised insomnia risk by fifty-nine percent&lt;/a&gt; and shaved an average of twenty-four minutes off total sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5130" data-end="5982"&gt;Loss of sleep time is only the surface cost. Blue and bright-white wavelengths suppress melatonin, essentially flipping the “daytime” switch in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and keeping cortisol production humming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5130" data-end="5982"&gt;Guarding that hour is like dimming the kitchen lights so your kombucha knows fermentation hours are over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5989" data-end="6038"&gt;7. Gift one micro-kindness before lights out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6040" data-end="6846"&gt;Before you shut the lamp, send a sincere text, set out a favorite mug for a partner’s morning coffee, or leave a sticky-note compliment on a colleague’s draft. Acts of kindness do two physiological jobs at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6040" data-end="6846"&gt;They release oxytocin, a hormone linked to bonding and trust, and oxytocin lowers blood pressure, creating an internal sensation of safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6040" data-end="6846"&gt;Mayo Clinic reports that participants with hypertension who spent discretionary money on others for six weeks recorded &lt;a href="https://connect.mayoclinic.org/blog/living-with-mild-cognitive-impairment-mci/newsfeed-post/the-power-of-kindness/?.com"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; than those who spent it on themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6040" data-end="6846"&gt;The cardiovascular calm is measurable, yet the emotional dividend—feeling like you are part of a human relay, not a solo sprint—may matter even more. Kindness carbonates your emotional brew so the final flavor is light rather than syrupy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6853" data-end="6890"&gt;Final words: let the brew steep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6892" data-end="7447"&gt;None of these habits require special gear, gurus, or heroic motivation; they only need rhythm. Sixty days delivers exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6892" data-end="7447"&gt;Begin with two habits that feel friction-free, then layer in the others each week like flavor infusions—ginger on week two, hibiscus on week three, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6892" data-end="7447"&gt;By the time your personal fermentation clock dings, notice how much more space there is between stimulus and response. That gap is your new agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6892" data-end="7447"&gt;Choose what fresh ingredients you would like to add next, and savor the calmer, less stressed person you have cultured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="article-featured-image" class="article-featured-image"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/24169542_-1024x768.jpg" alt="Kristopher Mohamed, 19, has been diagnosed with Hodgkin lymp"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Kristopher Mohamed, 19, has been diagnosed with Hodgkin lymp&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AT just 19 years old, Kristopher Mohamed is facing a life-threatening illness. Only a few months ago, he was preparing to begin his medical studies programme UWI. Today, he is focused on raising the much-needed US$130,000 for treatment. So far, around US$50,000 has been secured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vistabella teenager has been diagnosed with stage 4 Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. This system is responsible for producing and transporting infection-fighting white blood cells and plays a crucial role in protecting the body from disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It includes vital organs such as the bone marrow, thymus, and lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohamed received the devastating news in March. He recalls feeling unwell at the end of February, though the symptoms seemed mild at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I had maybe two symptoms. It wasn’t anything ordinary, but I knew something was wrong because I don’t usually get sick.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_1160877" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1160877" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-1160877" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/24169541_-805x1024.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1160877" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Kristopher Mohamed attended Naparima College.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially diagnosed with pneumonia after being rushed to Southern Medical Clinic due to severe chest pain, further tests revealed a different reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I was warded, the doctors wanted to run more tests and get a second opinion. They did a neck biopsy, and those results confirmed I had Hodgkin lymphoma,” he told Newsday via cellphone on June 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment he received the diagnosis remains vivid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was the last day, and I was supposed to be discharged. I was hoping to hear everything was fine and I could go home. Instead, I got the news. It was really shocking, and I had to take some time to process it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, Kristopher knew little about the disease but has since educated himself and expressed gratitude to the doctors who supported him throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The doctors gave me information at every step, and I was able to understand what was happening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohamed’s strength has been bolstered by the unwavering support of his loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone has been supporting me, especially my parents, my close friends, and my girlfriend. Everyone has been there for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239585826-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the initial treatment quote, Mohamed explained the cost may rise depending on changes in his medication and the progression of his condition, which adds urgency to his fundraising efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He admits the diagnosis took a toll on his mental health, but he is now focused on what lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mentally, I’m trying to stay strong. From the advice of my doctor, the best thing is to be positive because when you start treatment, you need to be strong. If I’m not, my body might not be able to handle the treatment properly, and that could lead to complications.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the journey so far, he said, “It’s been a lot to handle, but I had to remind myself why it’s so important to stay positive. I would say I’m acclimatising. I understand what I need to do, and I really just want to start treatment as soon as possible and get this over with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the National Library of Medicine, the cure rate for Hodgkin lymphoma in children, adolescents, and young adults is high, with survival rates exceeding 90 per cent. The five-year survival rate overall is around 88 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristopher remains hopeful and believes this is a cancer he can beat with proper treatment. He is not only asking for financial support but also for prayers and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every bit of support counts. It doesn’t have to be money. Sharing the post, helping others see it, so many people have reached out to me with their own cancer stories. Just having someone to talk to who has experienced something similar has helped a lot. People with Hodgkin lymphoma reached out and gave me helpful advice. They told me what symptoms to look out for and what to expect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says these stories and the encouragement he has received have strengthened his confidence and faith in recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this setback, Mohamed is determined to return to school, complete his medical degree, and live a long, healthy life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I won’t be able to start school immediately. I’m thinking about next year. Chemotherapy will go on for about three or four months, and during that time, my immune system will be very weak. It would be too risky for me to be in public where I could get sick easily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, he and his family are in the process of finalising the necessary chemotherapy medication and other medical arrangements as they continue to raise funds and prepare for the difficult months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hodgkin lymphoma also causes the production of abnormal lymphocytes, which can accumulate and form tumours. Common symptoms include fever, night sweats, fatigue, itchy skin, and painless swelling of lymph nodes in areas like the neck, armpits, belly, or groin.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Z never required a copay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Zollicoffer, known to his patients as Dr. Z, spent the last four decades serving the residents of Baltimore’s poorest neighborhoods—and the family physician never turned anyone away, even if they couldn’t afford to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Forget that dollar bill,” the &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/beloved-baltimore-doctor-couldnt-afford-cancer-treatment-patients-came-to-his-aid-michael-zollicoffer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;66-year-old told CBS News&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m going to see you no matter what. You walk in that door, you will be seen. You bring your grandma with you, I’ll see her, too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Zollicoffer built goodwill in his Maryland community instead of a massive bank account, a practice that may have looked misguided a few months ago when suddenly the doctor became the patient—diagnosed with a double dose of cancers, one renal and one rectal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, he discovered that his own insurance had lapsed due to a policy complication with Medicare. His treatment was suddenly going to cost about $150,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the news trickled out to all those patients Dr. Z had helped over the years, one of his high school friends, Michael Haynie, started a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-dr-mike-zollicoffers-cancer-battle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;GoFundMe campaign&lt;/a&gt; online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before long, all the gratitude and all the goodwill Dr. Z. had nurtured over many decades became a groundswell of support. More than 3,400 people came to his rescue, donating over $280,000 to take care of the selfless doctor in his time of need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE VALUE OF DOCTORS:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a title="After 6 Months Searching for New Doctor, Small Town’s Viral Video was ‘Just What the Doctor Ordered’" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/after-6-months-searching-for-new-doctor-viral-video-helps-cornwall-village-find-one/" rel="bookmark"&gt;After 6 Months Searching for New Doctor, Small Town’s Viral Video was ‘Just What the Doctor Ordered’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zollicoffer’s story also caught the attention of Maryland Congressman Kweisi Mfume. Mfume rose to the front of the House floor to insert &lt;a href="https://mfume.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-kweisi-mfume-pays-tribute-to-dr-michael-zollicoffer-with-congressional-record-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a written statement&lt;/a&gt; about Zollicoffer’s legacy into the Congressional Record, preserving a testimonial of Dr. Z’s grace within U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mister Speaker, you would be hard-pressed to find another individual with as much passion for healing and love for his community as Dr. Michael Zollicoffer,” Mfume read aloud. “For his kindness, his selflessness, and his God-given abilities, Dr. Z has been a pillar of the Baltimore community for decades. His cancer prognoses are positive and, God willing, he’ll be practicing in our City for years to come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zollicoffer’s insurance has since been restored and he’s continuing to see patients regularly. Most of all, he’s grateful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m going to say something that may seem crazy as heck,” Zollicoffer told Steve Hartman in the video below. “I’m thankful that I got cancer, because I am the happiest man on the planet, no matter what the outcome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DOC’S DEDICATION&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="For 3 Hours Doctors Continued CPR on Toddler with No Pulse–Until Life Returned" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/for-3-hours-doctors-continued-cpr-on-toddler-with-no-pulse-until-life-returned/" rel="bookmark"&gt;For 3 Hours Doctors Continued CPR on Toddler with No Pulse–Until Life Returned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is what you’re about! We are about giving: I can’t make it without them, nor can they make it without me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-dr-mike-zollicoffers-cancer-battle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Donate to the ongoing fund if you can&lt;/a&gt;, because even more people have arrived at his clinic since this story aired nationwide, looking for the compassion Dr. Z pays forward every day.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Get moving &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research on early humans shows they may have needed more sleep due to their active lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prehistoric humans were hunter-gatherers, meaning all their food came from hunting animals and gathering plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above is Dr Merijn van de Laar's book 'How to Sleep Like a Caveman'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This required them to travel up to a dozen miles a day on foot, and research estimates our ancestors walked twice as much as people today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women took around 11,000 steps a day while men trekked 19,000. Today, the average American walks 5,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study from &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.brandeis.edu/magazine/2019/winter/inquiry/walking.html"&gt;Brandeis University&lt;/a&gt; found middle-aged adults who walked an extra 2,000 steps a day slept longer and better than on days they were less active. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/10/e011055"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 500 adults found people who didn't exercise but walked 10,000 steps a day had improved sleep quality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Walking has been shown to release mood-boosting hormones called endorphins, which lower stress and can promote relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr van de Laar also suggests higher intensity exercise like jogging or cycling may improve sleep, but exercising within two hours of bedtime could increase your body temperature and heart rate, disrupting your sleep cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Adopt a dog &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Research shows dog owners may sleep more soundly because they are more active (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Records of man's best friend date back tens of thousands of years. Researchers have discovered footprints and paw prints beside each other and found people and dogs buried together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr van de Laar wrote that this suggests humans and dogs likely slept together, so dog owners who mimic their ancestors may get better sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 study found dog owners tend to sleep 53 minutes more at night than people without a canine companion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers suggested this could be because dog owners walk more during the day than non-owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr van de Laar wrote: 'An important factor here is that dog owners may have more active lifestyles anyway, which could make it more likely that they choose to have a dog. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At the same time, because of the active way of living, they might need more physical recovery anyway, which increases sleep duration.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dogs also offer a sense of companionship, leading to fewer feelings of loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Hunt and gather &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ancient diets focused on animal proteins, vegetables and other whole, unprocessed foods. Dr van de Laar suggests the high protein of a Paleo diet may help regulate sleep (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr van de Laar also suggests mimicking the diet of our ancestors, now known as the Paleo or caveman diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The plan involves eating foods that only could have been obtained through hunting and gathering, such as vegetables, nuts, seeds and lean meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ancient humans stuck to these foods until roughly 10,000 years ago, when agricultural practices increased the popularity of grains, legumes, dairy and vegetable oils. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Paleolithic diets were also high in protein from meats like beef and bison, which Dr van de Laar suggests could have sleep-promoting properties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent review of 19 studies found people who report sleeping more soundly at night tend to eat more protein-rich meals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.science.org/content/article/want-sleep-better-bulk-protein-animal-study-suggests"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; found mice and flies on high-protein diets had higher levels of molecules in their guts that improve sleep quality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research suggests opting for protein-rich meals instead of carbohydrates may help regulate blood sugar, preventing blood sugar spikes that can disrupt sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Eyes off the clock &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Recent studies show watching the clock while trying to sleep increases anxiety and stress, hampering sleep quality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prehistoric humans didn't sleep with an alarm clock or cell phone on their nightstand, and Dr van de Laar said ditching tech may lead to a more restful night's sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; A &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.iu.edu/live/news/28256-losing-sleep-over-losing-sleep-how-watching-the-clock-"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; from Indiana University studied 5,000 people with insomnia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants completed questionnaires about the severity of their insomnia, use of sleep medication and the time they spent watching a clock while trying to drift off at night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead researcher Spencer Dawson said: 'We found time-monitoring behavior mainly has an effect on sleep medication use because it exacerbates insomnia symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People are concerned that they’re not getting enough sleep, then they start estimating how long it will take them to fall back asleep and when they have to be up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That is not the sort of activity that’s helpful in facilitating the ability to fall asleep; the more stressed out you are, the harder time you’re going to have falling asleep.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr van de Laar wrote: &lt;/span&gt;'The conclusion is that it is important to remove visible clocks from the bedroom as much as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is important to move these as far away from your bedroom as possible and try to get through the night without a clock. The same applies to mobile phones.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Some even clock nearly thirty-five years in the wild, a lifespan that maps to about 180 human years and comes with an astonishing lack of tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.rochester.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Rochester&lt;/a&gt; team set out to uncover why, zeroing in on four bat species spanning both major bat &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/bats-surf-the-winds-of-storms-during-migration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lineages&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings point to a finely tuned partnership between an overachieving tumor suppressor gene, self-renewing chromosomes, and an immune system that fights hard but rarely overreacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by Vera Gorbunova and Andrei Seluanov of the &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/cancer-institute"&gt;Wilmot Cancer Institute and Department of Biology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bats-defy-aging-and-cancer-patterns"&gt;Bats defy aging and cancer patterns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer risk usually rises with age because every round of cell division adds another chance for DNA damage, a pattern known as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3060950/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Peto’s paradox&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across most &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-bats-navigate-noisy-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mammals&lt;/a&gt; the equation holds, but bats are clear outliers, with at least four separate bat lineages independently evolving extreme &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30966896/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study shows that the “little brown” bat (&lt;a href="https://www.fws.gov/species/little-brown-bat-myotis-lucifugus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Myotis lucifugus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) carries two working copies of the key tumor suppressor gene &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22268/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;p53&lt;/a&gt;, while humans carry only one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“High levels of p53 in the body can kill cancer cells before they become harmful in a process known as &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/apoptosis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;apoptosis&lt;/a&gt;,” said Gorbunova.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-myotis-lucifugus-the-basics"&gt;Understanding &lt;em&gt;Myotis lucifugus&lt;/em&gt; – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better known as the little brown bat, &lt;em&gt;Myotis lucifugus&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most widespread and familiar bat species in North America. You’ll often find them roosting in attics, barns, caves, and trees – basically anywhere cozy and dark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These bats are tiny, weighing less than half an ounce, but they pack a punch when it comes to eating insects. In a single night, one little brown bat can devour hundreds of mosquitoes and other bugs, making them natural pest controllers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They usually hibernate during the winter, often gathering in large colonies where the temperature stays just right. Sadly, their populations have taken a major hit due to white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease that’s devastated colonies across the continent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists and conservationists are working hard to figure out how to protect them, since losing these bats would ripple through entire ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duplicating p53 is not unique to bats; &lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/11994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;elephants&lt;/a&gt; stockpile roughly twenty versions of the same gene and show remarkably low cancer rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bats, however, balance extra p53 with regulatory tweaks so it prunes precancerous cells without wiping out healthy ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our animals can tolerate faster cell growth because their p53 is ready to pull the plug when things look suspicious,” said Seluanov. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rochester team found that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-bats-navigate-rush-hour-without-crashing-into-each-other/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt; cells need only two genetic “hits” to turn cancerous in a dish, far fewer than human cells, but the boosted p53 swiftly orders those rogue cells to self-destruct. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-endless-telomeres-controlled-chaos"&gt;Endless telomeres, controlled chaos&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bats also keep their chromosome tips long thanks to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12034875/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;constitutive telomerase&lt;/a&gt;, an enzyme most adult human tissues silence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier work in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29441358/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Myotis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; bats revealed that telomeres hardly shorten with age, helping tissues regenerate without sliding toward crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfettered telomerase can fuel tumors in other species, yet bats avoid that pitfall. When telomere-powered cell divisions pick up speed, the same hyper-alert p53 system steps in, neutralizing any cell that crosses the line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If cells divide uncontrollably, the higher p53 activity in bats compensates and can remove cancerous cells,” noted Seluanov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-bats-fight-disease"&gt;How bats fight disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third line of defense comes from a bat immune network that spots danger quickly but stays unusually calm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03128-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bats&lt;/a&gt; mute the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-019-0165-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NLRP3 inflammasome&lt;/a&gt; and tone down &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nri3787" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;type I interferon&lt;/a&gt; storms, preventing &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493173/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; that often seeds cancer in aging tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This balanced &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/immunosurveillance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;immune surveillance&lt;/a&gt; means viruses are cleared efficiently and damaged cells are flagged for destruction, yet surrounding tissue is spared collateral damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also report expanded natural killer cell receptor families in several bat genomes, hinting at a surveillance squad that never sleeps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-bats-can-teach-us-about-treating-cancer"&gt;What bats can teach us about treating cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several experimental drugs already seek to boost human p53 activity in stubborn tumors, and the bat data give that strategy an evolutionary vote of confidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others aim to reactivate telomerase in aged tissues; the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/bats-have-acoustic-mental-maps-to-navigate-total-darkness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt; blueprint suggests that pairing such therapies with stronger p53 safeguards could keep runaway cell growth in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt; funded the study because it touches on two grand challenges: healthy longevity and cancer prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If scientists can replicate the bat trio of robust p53, restrained inflammation, and prudent telomerase, future therapies might tackle both aging and malignancy in one stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-other-animals-can-teach-us"&gt;What other animals can teach us&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long looked to other long-lived animals for answers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10492090/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Naked mole rats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11580846/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bowhead whales&lt;/a&gt;, and elephants each have their own anti-cancer tricks, ranging from extra copies of tumor suppressor genes to unique cell death responses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bats now join this elite group, and their diverse adaptations offer a different evolutionary path toward disease resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings also support the case for cross-species genetic studies in humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If p53 enhancements or telomerase tuning can be translated safely, it could lead to preventive therapies for high-risk populations or those with inherited cancer mutations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What bats seem to offer is not a miracle gene, but a blueprint for managing cellular risk while still allowing the body to repair, grow, and age slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59403-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?

Now, scientists tell us that those who suffer from ASD and ADHD also face higher vulnerability to common plastic pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study found that their bodies detoxify &lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/sya-bpa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bisphenol A (BPA)&lt;/a&gt; less efficiently than neurotypical peers, increasing the time their tissues are exposed to this chemical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6148-2363" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. T. Peter Stein&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://som.rowan.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rowan‑Virtua School&lt;/a&gt; of Osteopathic Medicine led the study. Researchers measured urine glucuronidation, the liver process that adds a sugar molecule to BPA so it can be excreted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with ASD and ADHD had reduced BPA detoxification efficiency compared to the control group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28770280/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BPA glucuronidation&lt;/a&gt; was about 11% lower in the ASD group and 17% lower in those with ADHD, while differences in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5842715/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;phthalate DEHP&lt;/a&gt; detoxification followed the same trend but were not statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with ASD and ADHD often have weaker detox systems, leaving them exposed to BPA in the body longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t guarantee illness from BPA but raises concern. Stein noted that this was the “first hard biochemical evidence” linking impaired BPA clearance to &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/americaschildrenenvironment/health-neurodevelopmental-disorders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;neurodevelopmental disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-asd-and-adhd-the-basics"&gt;Understanding ASD and ADHD – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/autism/what-is-autism-spectrum-disorder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Individuals with ASD&lt;/a&gt; often face challenges in social communication and exhibit restricted or repetitive behaviors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They might have difficulty interpreting social cues, maintaining eye contact, or adjusting to changes in routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensory sensitivities – such as heightened responses to light, sound, or textures – are also common. ASD presents across a wide spectrum, so the degree and nature of symptoms can vary greatly from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, ADHD primarily involves persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that interfere with daily functioning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;People with ADHD&lt;/a&gt; may struggle to focus, stay organized, or complete tasks, often acting without thinking or having trouble sitting still. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ADHD and ASD are separate diagnoses, they can co-occur, and some traits overlap – such as difficulties with executive function and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-measuring-bpa-detoxification"&gt;Measuring BPA detoxification&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/glucuronidation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Glucuronidation&lt;/a&gt; converts toxins like BPA into water‑soluble compounds that exit via urine. In this study, mass spectrometry tracked both bound and unbound BPA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lower percentage of detoxification indicated less efficient excretion. Stein’s team confirmed the effect held true even when accounting for urine strength using creatinine levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of twelve detox pathways tested, only BPA and DEHP stood out, suggesting a specific vulnerability rather than a broad weakness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing results with metabolomic profiles, ASD and ADHD children showed unique patterns tied to BPA metabolism that controls did not share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bpa-detox-with-adhd-and-asd"&gt;BPA detox with ADHD and ASD&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;BPA and DEHP act as &lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/endocrine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;endocrine disruptors&lt;/a&gt;, interfering with hormone signals. If detoxification is compromised, these chemicals linger longer in the body during critical phases of brain development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though genetic vulnerability may play a role, this adds a measurable biological mechanism to the environmental risk picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sterile in lab animals, DEHP affects neurodevelopment via epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation. A recent &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.03.641339" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of prenatal exposure in 847 Australian children linked DEHP levels to later ASD and ADHD symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-role-of-methylation-in-gene-expression-1070/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Methylation&lt;/a&gt; in key genes and neural cell networks showed mediation effects between 21% and 80%. These epigenetic footprints reinforce the idea that plastics can affect neurodevelopment through non-genetic pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-evidence-of-environmental-links"&gt;Evidence of environmental links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study builds on a large body of research connecting neurodevelopmental disorders to environmental pollutants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK201995/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Epidemiological studies&lt;/a&gt; have associated prenatal exposure to air pollution, flame retardants, and pesticides with elevated ASD and ADHD risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The common thread in these findings is timing; exposure during pregnancy and early life seems to matter most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulatory bodies have long debated what constitutes a “safe” exposure level for these chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-packaging-other-substances-come-contact-food-information-consumers/bisphenol-bpa-use-food-contact-application" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/bisphenol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;European Food Safety Authority&lt;/a&gt; have reviewed BPA safety multiple times, but the growing evidence suggests current thresholds may not be low enough for sensitive populations, especially children with neurodevelopmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-it-means-for-families"&gt;What it means for families&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study doesn’t claim BPA or DEHP cause &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/children-with-autism-benefit-from-learning-multiple-languages/"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; or ADHD. But it does show that children with these conditions often metabolize these chemicals less efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because BPA exposure is widespread (found in everything from food can liners to thermal paper) this raises questions about safety thresholds for all kids, not just those with ASD or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/autism-and-adhd-disorders-directly-linked-amount-of-time-kids-spend-on-screens/"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing reliance on BPA and phthalates in daily life (choosing glass or stainless steel containers, fresh food over cans, and avoiding receipts) can help limit exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy swings already reflect this concern: several countries are phasing out DEHP and tightening BPA regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-in-research"&gt;Next steps in research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies could investigate whether impaired detoxification is present from birth or develops over time. Longitudinal tracking of exposure, detox pathway function, and neurodevelopment could help answer this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also recommend examining genetic variants in detox enzymes, which might identify individuals most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the epigenetic side, researchers are starting to connect prenatal chemical exposure to long‑term &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/is-your-dna-information-safe-scientists-warn-of-cyber-threats/"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; changes in specific brain regions, pointing to windows of vulnerability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That knowledge could eventually guide nurse‑led intervention, dietary changes, or policies to protect early brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with ASD and ADHD are at a double vulnerability: genetic and developmental differences and a slower ability to clear everyday pollutants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study doesn’t offer advice on treatment or diagnosis, it certainly does ask parents and policymakers to seriously consider chemical exposure in early childhood and pregnancy as a significant factor in neurodevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0289841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2025 14:34:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxOSThtNmZNOE9TLWJtdXNPY2FmQlpscEJQQTlXb1VrenJnaDdDQXhYNU9Gcmd0M2lDb0ZNNzZLTFFmTXQ3Q2xQVDRpSld5LWJMamMtbm9kQS1xcE9jVXNQOWN0WmhORVdIUUQxc0RNZUNITG9NVWZNRUx2Z3BERFg2Qk56SEF6SlNHTjc5UEhxR2g0aEhFNnp4blNLSS1DU0tTWUY4clF2SHFqSnFVWVNv</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现战胜失眠的惊人技巧- futurism.com | Scientists Discover Startling Trick to Defeat Insomnia - futurism.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE8zWV9KSlpqMV9xUDNEdXBIV2lkT2NSbmZ1bFJ5cnJpUUxvZHdFWWNnWS1lbldiZHhXUTR3a1puNUFWMXFiTFp2cWdyMXZmSXg0bmlIMWRFc3BXY1B4TTFPVDBScjloamRGcldKU1ZYbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section id="incArticle" class="post-content z-50 w-full p-3 space-y-4 bg-white border lg:-mt-6 md:p-4 md:border-gray-900 lg:ml-3 lg:w-2/3 font-b text-3"&gt;&lt;div class="space-y-4 lg:space-y-0"&gt;&lt;p class="block text-xs text-gray-500 uppercase lg:hidden font-c"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Image by Getty / Futurism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insomnia is a curse we wouldn't wish on our worst enemy — and scientists have discovered a startlingly simple lifestyle change that appears to be very statistically effective at preventing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study &lt;a href="https://www.sleephealthjournal.org/article/S2352-7218(25)00089-0/abstract" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Sleep Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers from Columbia and the University of Chicago report that eating a full day's serving worth of fruits and vegetables strongly appears to help people sleep more soundly throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interrupted sleep, which is known as "sleep fragmentation" to researchers, has been found to induce a litany of grim health outcomes ranging from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004224002967" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28579842/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18988299/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;cognitive problems&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25244484/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;cognitive dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One major culprit might be a familiar one to many participants in our industrial food system: poor nutrition lacking in fresh fruits and veggies. The researchers recruited 34 healthy young adults with an average age of 28 years old who had no known sleep issues before. The participants were tasked with tagging their food input into an app for 201 days, and wore wrist monitors that tracked their sleep throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After analyzing the data from the app and wrist monitors with statistical modeling, the researchers found that sleep quality can improve up to a staggering 16 percent after eating five cups of fruit and vegetables — the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's definition of a full day's serving — as compared to a diet that lacks produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the effects were effectively instantaneous: sleep improvements took place the very same nights that participants reported eating lots of fruits and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It’s remarkable that such a meaningful change could be observed within less than 24 hours," explained UChicago sleep expert Esra Tasali said in the &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/research-and-discoveries-articles/eating-fruits-and-veggies-may-improve-sleep" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;school's press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though 16 percent may not seem like much, Tasali characterized it as a "highly significant difference."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's possible, per &lt;a href="https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/want-sleep-better-tonight-try-eating-more-fruits-and-veggies" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Columbia's statement&lt;/a&gt; on the study, that the amino acid tryptophan — the same one &lt;a href="https://inside.charlotte.edu/2024/11/22/the-truth-about-tryptophan-and-thanksgiving-turkey-tiredness/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;cited in anecdata&lt;/a&gt; about getting sleepy post-Thanksgiving turkey — might be responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fruits and vegetables contain carbohydrates that help the brain absorb tryptophan, Columbia explains, which in turn helps aid the production of the sleepy hormone melatonin. Though you can purchase synthetic melatonin supplements at the store, it's tastier and healthier to get your brain to produce it for you by eating produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five cups may seem a bit daunting, but the researchers insist that eating more fruits and vegetables in general can help you sleep better even if you don't reach that full serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are always asking me if there are things they can eat that will help them sleep better," author Marie-Pierre St-Onge, the director of Columbia's sleep center, said in the school's press release. "Small changes can impact sleep. That is empowering — better rest is within your control."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/elon-musk-tweets-sleep" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;You Can See When Elon Musk Actually Sleeps by Analyzing His Tweets, and It's Terrifying&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>futurism.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2025 14:30:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE8zWV9KSlpqMV9xUDNEdXBIV2lkT2NSbmZ1bFJ5cnJpUUxvZHdFWWNnWS1lbldiZHhXUTR3a1puNUFWMXFiTFp2cWdyMXZmSXg0bmlIMWRFc3BXY1B4TTFPVDBScjloamRGcldKU1ZYbw</guid></item><item><title>据专家介绍，降低血糖水平的最佳7天步行计划- EatingWell | The Best 7-Day Walking Plan to Lower Your Blood Sugar Levels, According to Experts - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxQSGQwRnlBUUFvazkzalhCVklUMUNiZjVKaUtfMld4MWY4Ym1KcGFINllPdHFxM1JKM3BZcGFZUzZSN0NEQ3BZd0tsMDBrUUFNWThWd2VwVXhBaGp2bHhGSklEM1JYaWlPTkZVZlBlclNYY2t5QjlDUHpCT2NKT0NJbGFCTlFfSW1GX0FtaFp5bTU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walking after meals helps muscles absorb glucose, reducing blood sugar and insulin levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moderate post-meal walks can cut insulin needs and improve insulin sensitivity over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just 15–30 mins of walking daily can lower blood sugar for 24 hours and support long-term control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You need not conquer an exhausting CrossFit workout or cross the finish line at a marathon to score some serious health benefits of exercise. In fact, a mounting body of scientific research proves that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7944867/is-walking-a-good-enough-form-of-exercise/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;walking is one of the best&lt;/a&gt;, most sustainable and most effective exercise options to support mental and physical health over the life span.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And the benefits begin at a mere two minutes. Research shows that a short walk of two to five minutes is enough to result in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7998411/walking-after-meals-lower-blood-sugar-science/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower blood sugar levels after a meal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Blood glucose, or blood sugar, provides energy to your body's cells, tissues and organs to help them function properly. When blood sugar levels drop too low, your energy level dips too. You may feel tired, shaky, irritable or lightheaded. But a sustained high blood sugar level can also zap energy; chronic fatigue can be a symptom of insulin resistance," says &lt;a href="https://www.cynthiasass.com/about/meet-la-plant-based-sports-and-performance-nutritionist-cynthia-sass" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cynthia Sass, M.P.H., M.A., RD, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified sports dietitian in private practice in Los Angeles, who has consulted for five pro sports teams and works with athletes privately.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's normal for blood sugar levels to fluctuate, but most humans feel best energy-wise when blood sugar remains steadier and within an ideal range: not too low and not too high. This easy seven-day walking plan can help you hit the sweet spot.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since the strolls are broken up into shorter segments, starting at just five minutes, this week of walking workouts is ideal if you're just getting started with exercise, adds &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/michele_canon_fit/?hl=en" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Michele Canon&lt;/a&gt;, a NASM-certified personal trainer, STRIDE Fitness coach and owner of Michele Canon Fitness &amp;amp; Nutrition in Pasadena, California.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-exercise-and-blood-sugar-whats-the-connection"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Exercise and Blood Sugar: What's the Connection? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Typically, and with most forms of moderate-intensity cardio (aka aerobic) activity, we see blood glucose levels decrease during exercise, explains &lt;a href="https://www.acefitness.org/resources/author/102/dr-erin-nitschke/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Erin Nitschke, CPT, Ed.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an ACE-certified health coach and therapeutic exercise specialist. But since higher-intensity activities and weight training can trigger the release of stress hormones, such as adrenaline, the liver gets the memo that it needs to release glucose to deal with the hard work ahead.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of prompting a stress response, a brisk walk challenges the body just enough. Walking engages our largest muscle groups, which are found in our lower body, Canon explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The movements during walking stimulate muscle contractions and blood flow—especially within your hips, calves, glutes, hamstrings and quadriceps—which helps deliver glucose from the outside to the inside of the muscle cell, where that energy can be stored and used as fuel.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Especially when performed within 30 minutes to 2 hours after a meal, walking allows your muscles to burn recently consumed carbohydrates for fuel to power your movement. This, in turn, lowers blood glucose or blood sugar levels," Sass says. "Post-meal walks also reduce the amount of insulin your body needs to release after eating carbohydrates, because active muscle cells can take in glucose or blood sugar with less or no insulin."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is key because, over time, high blood insulin levels can lead to insulin resistance, which means cells become less responsive to insulin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Insulin resistance causes blood sugar levels to remain higher for longer periods of time (since insulin isn't working properly to carry sugar out of the blood), which can eventually lead to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2060690/what-is-prediabetes-and-6-steps-to-help-you-manage-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prediabetes&lt;/a&gt; and perhaps progress into type 2 diabetes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People who walk after a meal can experience lower insulin levels by up to 50 times more than if they stayed sedentary, Canon says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The benefits of walking last far longer than the workout itself: "Physical activity can lower your blood sugar up to 24 hours post-activity and make your body and muscles more sensitive to insulin," adds &lt;a href="https://roxanaehsani.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Roxana Ehsani, M.S., RD, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;, a Miami-based board-certified sports dietitian.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-much-to-walk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Much to Walk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This walking program for healthier blood sugar levels is designed to be suitable for beginners. It starts with three 5-minute walks per day and progresses up to three 10- to 12-minute daily walks. Feel free to increase or decrease the minutes of activity based on your comfort level and experience. For an additional challenge, after every 3 minutes of walking, pause and perform a few body-weight squats or lunges, or employ some Nordic walking poles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can break things up to score that bonus post-meal boost, or if time is tight, combine the minutes to do a single walk per day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Exercise is cumulative, so you can walk for 5-minute bouts or 10-minute bouts. Tailor this to your comfort level and enjoyment," Nitschke advises. And she highly recommends chatting with your doctor if you're new to fitness: "It's always wise to check with your primary care provider before making any changes to your activity or nutrition routine."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Depending on your current blood sugar levels, diet and walking intensity, you might expect to see results in your overall fasting glucose levels in about two to six weeks, Canon says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "The results will be quicker if you combine consistent walking with a diet that's low in sugar and processed carbohydrates," she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-day-walking-plan"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 7-Day Walking Plan &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walking uses the sugar you consume through food as energy for the muscles. As a result, walking helps lower blood sugar levels. Simultaneously, walking improves insulin sensitivity, since the pancreas won't be called on to produced as much insulin to deal with the levels of sugar remaining in the blood after a meal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This seven-day walking plan to help manage blood sugar levels includes short segments of walking after each of the three main meals of the day. The best way to lower blood sugar over the long term is to integrate physical activity into your routine and pair it with a well-balanced, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7994446/best-high-fiber-foods-for-diabetes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;fiber-rich diet&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_67-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keep in mind that just one walk per day or walking on fewer days per week is A-OK. Any activity is better than no activity, Nitschke says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_68-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_69-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Start slow and work your way up; this will aid in adherence and motivation. If six days a week of activity feels like too much, then it likely is. Start with every other day and work toward a greater frequency. It's about progress, not perfection," she adds.

When she ran across the &lt;em&gt;Bioelectronic Medicine&lt;/em&gt; study, which found that four people with long COVID brain fog who used nicotine patches for a week had seen a marked improvement in concentration, she was intrigued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because patches seemed like too much nicotine for her to handle at seven milligrams, Singleton opted to use the lowest-dose nicotine gum she could find, which contained only two. Within an hour, her "brain felt like it had come back online in a way it hadn’t in months," and she became a convert then and there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While tobacco products like cigarettes, vapes, and snuff are known for their many terrible side effects, the patches are safer because they deliver nicotine, which stimulates brain receptors, in slow, controlled doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that nicotine receptors are involved particularly in attention — so the ability to focus and maintain attention, all of that seems to have an important role for nicotinic signaling," Paul Newhouse, a Vanderbilt cognitive medicine specialist, told &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt;. "And attention is the front end of memory, right? So without attention, you can’t encode or remember anything."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with Levin, the Duke researcher, Newhouse published a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3466669/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;pioneering study in 2012&lt;/a&gt; that found that short-term nicotine use can help improve cognitive functioning for people with cognitive impairments — and the pair is now finishing a larger, &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/alz.064697" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;multi-year follow-up&lt;/a&gt; to see how that same initial cohort fared years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As fascinating as those studies are, people who use nicotine therapeutically are still, Singleton notes, "very much experimenting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are no protocols or prescribed doses approved by the Food and Drug Administration," she continued. "Overall, it might be accurate to say that nicotine 'holds promise' as a potential tool for brain functioning."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, using nicotine patches to help with concentration is a compelling, if not surprising, off-label use — and with stimulant medications backlogged in a &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/adhd-shortage-doctor-day" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;years-long manufactured shortage&lt;/a&gt;, a safe over-the-counter alternative is good to keep in one's back pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on cognitive function:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/cognitive-decay-ai" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Man Alarmed as His Cognitive Skills Decay After Outsourcing Them to AI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>futurism.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2025 13:45:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE5YTl80bEtKNVhCUk5CaGlFQ0VsSlNETFI2VmR4QXNYV1k3OHJhZXpXenpubFNTT1c3c2RBZFh5aGNnS19KZ0tkbTR3dlBUbFZsVmZDT1FnMzRpMlZmY0dZMUMxNzVzckd6enl2ZHFIVE5mQ0o1bklv</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，人类在生命中的2个特定时间衰老更快- ScienceAlert | Humans Age Faster at 2 Specific Times in Their Life, Study Finds - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxORXppLTlocDE0X1dRSWg1S1pkTl9RT1RLc0FYdDJPZk5iUW1taG9abDA0b2lqZUVOY3dFTzQ1bzRMOTd6dXVzUURWQlJfV2s5ZDlsTlktTVVFNWtzc0VpalRoYWlRS3I1T3U0YzFKc2pZYzF5MmxXbzdzaTBHUkxaeV9JU3V6WUVTazlobnBaLTlpelc4RWhz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Getting older might seem like a slow, gradual process – but that's not always the case, research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, if you wake up one morning, look in the mirror, and wonder if your aging somehow accelerated, you might not be imagining things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a recent study into the molecular changes associated with aging, humans experience two drastic lurches forward, one at the average age of 44, and the other at the average age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not just changing gradually over time; there are some really dramatic changes," geneticist Michael Snyder of Stanford University &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/08/massive-biomolecular-shifts-occur-in-our-40s-and-60s--stanford-m.html"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; in August 2024 when the study was published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It turns out the mid-40s is a time of dramatic change, as is the early 60s. And that's true no matter what class of molecules you look at."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging is complex, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-could-be-caused-by-brain-cells-that-age-too-fast"&gt;associated with growing risks of diseases&lt;/a&gt; of all kinds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snyder and his colleagues investigated the biology of aging to better understand what changes occur and how, in order to better mitigate and treat these ailments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To this end, they tracked a group of 108 adults, who had been donating biological samples every few months over several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They noticed that in&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10522-021-09910-5"&gt; some conditions&lt;/a&gt;, such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="164672" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2308-3425/6/2/19"&gt; cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, risk doesn't rise gradually with time, it escalates sharply after a certain age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So they wanted to take a closer look at the biomarkers of aging to see if they could identify related changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_132987" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132987" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonSquattingOutdoors.jpg" alt="An older male squatting with outstretched arms in a park" class="wp-image-132987 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonSquattingOutdoors.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonSquattingOutdoors-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonSquattingOutdoors-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132987" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The molecular changes associated with aging show that humans experience two drastic lurches forward.

The different molecules studied include RNA, proteins, lipids, and gut, skin, nasal, and oral microbiome taxa, for a total of 135,239 biological features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant submitted an average of 47 samples over 626 days, with the longest-serving participant submitting 367 samples. This wealth of data resulted in more than 246 billion data points, which the researchers then processed, looking for patterns in the changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several previous studies have found non-linear changes in molecular abundances that can be linked to aging in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(19)31091-5"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0673-2"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies of fruit flies, mice, and zebrafish have also pointed to a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aging/articles/10.3389/fragi.2024.1378351/full"&gt;stepwise aging process in those species&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snyder and his colleagues noticed that there's a very clear change in the abundance of many different kinds of molecules in the human body at two distinct stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 81 percent of all the molecules they studied showed changes during one or both of these stages. Changes peaked in the mid-40s, and again in the early 60s, with slightly different profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mid-40s peak showed changes in molecules related to the metabolism of lipids,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="164672" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, and alcohol, as well as cardiovascular disease, and dysfunctions in skin and muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early 60s peak was associated with carbohydrate and caffeine metabolism, cardiovascular disease, skin and muscle, immune regulation, and kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first peak, the mid-40s, is typically when women start undergoing menopause or perimenopause, but the researchers ruled this out as a main factor: men, too, also underwent significant molecular changes at the same age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that while menopause or perimenopause may contribute to the changes observed in women in their mid-40s, there are likely other, more significant factors influencing these changes in both men and women," &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/08/massive-biomolecular-shifts-occur-in-our-40s-and-60s--stanford-m.html"&gt;explained metabolomicist and first author Xiaotao Shen&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of Stanford, now at Nanyang Technological University Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Identifying and studying these factors should be a priority for future research."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144095" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144095" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwoFacesAgingConcept642-1.jpg" alt="A young woman's face next to an older woman's face, both are smiling" class="size-full wp-image-144095" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwoFacesAgingConcept642-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwoFacesAgingConcept642-1-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwoFacesAgingConcept642-1-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144095" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Changes peaked in the mid-40s, and again in the early 60s.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbu0t9yt001b3b769i7sqp2p@published"&gt;My husband and I have been married for three years, and in that time we have had sex exactly four times. While we were dating he said he preferred to wait, and I was willing to respect that. I have spent the time since our wedding night wondering why he has so little interest in me; nearly all my attempts to get him to have sex ended in rejection. The only times we had sex were on our wedding night, our first two anniversaries, and my birthday back in February.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbu0t9yt001c3b76x2tojkuw@published"&gt;A month ago, my husband claimed to be asexual and told me I was free to pursue an open marriage if I wanted. He refused my request for us to attend counseling and I have been weighing my options as to whether I want to remain married to him or take him up on his offer to allow me to see other people. Then two nights ago I discovered him masturbating to online porn. He didn’t hear me approaching and I left the room before he noticed I was there. Do asexual people masturbate? Part of me is now questioning whether he was telling me the truth about his lack of desire for sex. Should I confront him?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbu0t9yu001f3b76ov6l8899@published"&gt;To get the basics out of the way: Yes, some asexual people masturbate. Hell, some asexual people have sex. Their genitals often “work” (to reference your sign-off) in the way allosexual people’s genitals “work”—that is, they show signs of physical arousal like erections and wetness. What distinguishes asexuals, broadly speaking, is that they lack &lt;em&gt;sexual attraction&lt;/em&gt;. What this means, according to Angela Chen, author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ace-Asexuality-Reveals-Society-Meaning/dp/0807014737/ref=sr_1_1?crid=101SH2XNAMEJZ&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9._sr8EYUmEw9g6mP9N-Z_rnQ3Gma_dmDC5ppnwBTntJKUpjDdL0WR92ZXSLDS4uZ0T3BP7_9S80EiVsbhXyvg-JEqKOVgbst7_YHDb5XmqUk.Z-mfZwnQ3jf8iz2urfsrQlbZOSnaHFkdgZX8zz0xi5c&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=ace+angela+chen&amp;amp;qid=1749477930&amp;amp;sprefix=ace+angel,aps,121&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ace: What Asexuality Reveals About Desire, Society, and the Meaning of Sex&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is: “the desire to have sex with a specific person for physical reasons. Sexual attraction can be instantaneous and involuntary: a heightened awareness, a physical alertness combined with mental wanting.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="66" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbu0t9yu001g3b76lfp141q4@published"&gt;Because this concept can be foreign to people who think asexuality simply means not having sex of any sort (be it partnered or solo), Chen  fleshes out what asexuality actually looks like with partnered/solo sex. She cites an ace source, “Sarah,” who has masturbated since she was young and reports that when she masturbates, “attraction does not factor into it at all for me.” Chen continues:&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;blockquote data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-blockquote/instances/cmbu13gds00353b76n6h09h0m@published" class="slate-blockquote" data-word-count="62"&gt;
  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah masturbates when she gets—her voice becomes high-pitched and facetious—“a tingling in my nethers,” but the fact that seeing a person or an act can cause physical changes in one’s own body or desire in one’s mind does not compute. “I cannot comprehend how attraction works,” she continues. “You look at a body and it turns you on? I don’t get it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbu0t9yu001i3b76q8l0jps0@published"&gt;Sex drive—that which may prompt someone to masturbate—is different than sexual attraction. Chen explains the contrast via food metaphor: “A person can feel physiological hunger, which would be like sex drive, without craving a specific dish, which would be more like sexual attraction.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="150" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbu0t9yv001j3b76yvbqegs7@published"&gt;In light of the above-quoted comments from Sarah, you may still be wondering why someone who says they lack sexual attraction may still seek out porn. Asexuality is not monolithic so there are a variety of potential reasons. In &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Asexual/comments/yczf63/why_do_asexuals_enjoy_watching_porn_when_they/"&gt;this thread on r/asexuality&lt;/a&gt;, various respondents give their reasons, including being into the situation (and not necessarily the people in the situation), empathy, the dopamine hit from porn, and simple response to stimuli. Again, arousal is not attraction. “It feels good to hear / see other people feeling good,” explained one Redditor. “It’s sort of like how listening to upbeat music makes you happy, and how you might listen to it specifically for that reason. Just sets the mood I guess?” You should also be aware that there are people on the ace spectrum who may feel sexual attraction but don’t have the desire to act on it—they’re known as &lt;a href="https://orientation.fandom.com/wiki/Aegosexual"&gt;aegosexual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="111" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbu0t9yv001k3b76cf3ykxjm@published"&gt;I hope this puts things into perspective so that you can have a productive conversation with your husband about these things. I advise you not to come in confrontational, but curious. Of course what you discovered would be confusing to most allos who don’t have much or any knowledge about asexuality. (Incidentally, if you want to know more, and I think you should, Chen’s book is a great place to start.) Could your husband have hatched a ruse to avoid having sex with you? Sure, that’s possible, but so is identifying as ace and masturbating/viewing porn. Go into whatever discussion you have on this topic with compassion and an open mind.&lt;/p&gt;

Some women might be OK with it, but I’m not one of them. It’s getting to the point where I no longer feel comfortable assuming the doggy position during sex because I have a suspicion he may “surprise” me. How can I get Jerome to accept that this is off the table?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbu0t9yv001p3b76z1cdr7aq@published"&gt;Telling him that you are wary of doggy style because you’re afraid that he might attempt to penetrate your butt would be a clear and vivid way to express the stress of his badgering. You should not feel unsafe in your own bed, and he should feel bad about making you feel that way. Hopefully, bringing this to his attention will cause him to change course. If not, you can make it explicit: Sex is becoming burdensome for you because of his fixation. This is serious. If you are resolute in your refusal and know that anal sex is absolutely something you will never try, tell him that. Let him know that his pestering is destined to be in vain. When he brings it up, remind him that your answer is a fixed and hard no.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbu0t9yw001q3b762f30lznb@published"&gt;You should, however, at least contemplate what he is to do with this fascination of his. Should this be forever confined to the realm of fantasy and porn for him? Is there any ethical way for him to experience it? That route may involve him seeking sex outside of the relationship, which you also may be against. But unquenched desire can be nagging, which is I think why he’s nagging you. If you can deal with shooting him down regularly and perhaps never having sex from behind again, OK. You both have related but very different-looking crosses to bear. If the burden can’t be lightened amongst yourselves, consider sex counseling.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="65" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbu0tla400243b761awfwonk@published"&gt;First, a note on e coli: Sure it’s not something that anyone &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt;, per se, but it’s not the death sentence that extreme cases reported on the news might suggest. In fact, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16638-e-coli-infection"&gt;e coli is responsible for some types of UTIs&lt;/a&gt;, which again, no one wants, but are highly curable. There are worse things than having a little bit of e coli in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="180" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbu0tla400253b7651uc4b6p@published"&gt;Anal sex can be messy and unsanitary, sure, but it doesn’t have to be. Irrespective of what your husband does to prep (more on that in a sec), &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can protect yourself from germs by wearing latex/nitrile/rubber gloves or opting not to finger him at all in favor of using a sex toy. There are sex toys that are relatively small in size (dilators, dildos, and prostate stimulators) that may accomplish what your husband’s looking for better than your thumb. A small butt plug would do the trick, as well. Even if you do go the digital route, I suggest your index or middle finger, as it’ll give you better access to his prostate and easier manipulation of it—provided that he’s actually looking for a prostate massage. His prostate, by the way, is located a few inches in his rectum on the front side of his body. If he’s lying on his back and you insert a finger with your palm up, you should be able to feel and manipulate it by curling your finger in a “come here” motion.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbu0tla400263b76rsjhdbot@published"&gt;And yes, he can clean out to minimize poop leakage. It would be a lot of work for taking a mere thumb, but he could do it. Douching should be performed with a small bulb douche (&lt;a href="https://futuremethod.com/products/reusable-bulb"&gt;like this one from Future Method&lt;/a&gt;). Fiber supplements should greatly help—they bulk and bind, which often makes the douching process way quicker and more efficient.

							&lt;p data-start="287" data-end="1120"&gt;A dermatologist can tighten skin and a barber can trim grey hairs, yet nothing restores vitality faster than the everyday choices we make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="287" data-end="1120"&gt;In Buddhism we speak of &lt;em data-start="450" data-end="457"&gt;karma&lt;/em&gt; as the aggregate of causes and conditions; in modern psychology we talk about &lt;em data-start="536" data-end="560"&gt;behavioral micro‑doses&lt;/em&gt; that nudge our biology toward health or decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="287" data-end="1120"&gt;The good news is that many of the habits that age us the fastest are also the easiest to drop—&lt;em data-start="704" data-end="708"&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; we give them a clean break for about two months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="287" data-end="1120"&gt;Sixty days is long enough for measurable physiological change: telomeres lengthen when stress falls, sleep resets hormonal rhythms, connective tissue begins to remodel, and epigenetic “clocks” literally tick more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="287" data-end="1120"&gt;Below are eight behaviors to retire—starting today—so you can greet the mirror (and the morning) looking and feeling years younger by Day 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1127" data-end="1159"&gt;1. Marinating in daily stress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1161" data-end="1605"&gt;Chronic psychological stress releases cortisol and inflammatory cytokines that hack away at the protective caps on our DNA—telomeres. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15574496/"&gt;landmark study&lt;/a&gt; by Elissa Epel and Nobel laureate Elizabeth Blackburn found that highly stressed adults had telomeres biologically a decade older than their calmer peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1161" data-end="1605"&gt;From a Buddhist lens, stress is &lt;em data-start="1537" data-end="1545"&gt;dukkha&lt;/em&gt;—suffering caused by clinging to outcomes we can’t control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1607" data-end="1938"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1607" data-end="1625"&gt;Swap‑in habit:&lt;/strong&gt; set three “micro‑pause” alarms (60 seconds each) through the workday. During each pause, breathe in for four counts, hold for four, exhale for six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1607" data-end="1938"&gt;Clinical trials show this simple pattern drops cortisol within minutes. Forty‑five mindful breaths per day is cheaper than retinol and does more for cellular youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1945" data-end="1998"&gt;2. Sacrificing sleep for productivity (or Netflix)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2000" data-end="2376"&gt;Skimping on sleep accelerates “epigenetic age”—the chemical tags that predict how old our organs behave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2000" data-end="2376"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11253334/"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; using the GrimAge clock showed that poor sleepers had cells as much as three years older than chronological peers. Less than seven hours also disrupts growth hormone, a natural night‑time repair crew for skin and muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2378" data-end="2730"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2378" data-end="2396"&gt;Swap‑in habit:&lt;/strong&gt; treat 10 p.m. like an international flight departure—non‑negotiable. Dim lights an hour earlier, substitute doom‑scrolling with light fiction, and reserve your bedroom strictly for sleep and intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2378" data-end="2730"&gt;One month of 7½‑hour nights noticeably brightens eyes and evens skin tone (I’ve tested this during my own marathon training blocks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2737" data-end="2763"&gt;3. Sitting yourself old&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2765" data-end="3148"&gt;Every extra hour parked in a chair speeds up two leading epigenetic clocks—PhenoAge and GrimAge—according to a recent &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11481432/"&gt;East‑Asian cohort study. &lt;/a&gt;The mechanism is two‑fold: reduced muscle insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial sluggishness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2765" data-end="3148"&gt;Buddhists describe the body as a “vehicle of practice”; leave the vehicle idling too long and parts corrode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3150" data-end="3403"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3150" data-end="3168"&gt;Swap‑in habit:&lt;/strong&gt; convert one Zoom call a day into a walking meeting. If that’s impossible, install a 30‑minute stand‑and‑stretch timer. Aim for 8,000 cumulative steps; numerous meta‑analyses show it’s the sweet spot for longevity without overtraining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3410" data-end="3433"&gt;4. Sugar overloading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3435" data-end="3748"&gt;Glucose and fructose hook onto collagen like Velcro, forming advanced glycation end products (AGEs) that&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20620757/"&gt; stiffen skin and deepen wrinkles.&lt;/a&gt;UV light then turbo‑charges the damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3435" data-end="3748"&gt;The Buddha taught &lt;em data-start="3670" data-end="3682"&gt;middle way&lt;/em&gt;; modern science agrees—our cells need glucose, not a syrup flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3750" data-end="4061"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3750" data-end="3768"&gt;Swap‑in habit:&lt;/strong&gt; cut all &lt;em data-start="3777" data-end="3784"&gt;added&lt;/em&gt; sugars for 60 days rather than wrestling with vague “moderation.” Re‑train your palate with naturally sweet foods—berries, roasted carrots, a square of 85 % dark chocolate. In about three weeks your taste buds reset, cravings plummet, and skin often looks clearer and tighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4068" data-end="4107"&gt;5. Heavy (or even “social”) drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4109" data-end="4538"&gt;We’ve long known alcohol dehydrates skin, but genomic data now confirm it accelerates biological aging system‑wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4109" data-end="4538"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2022-07-26-genetic-study-provides-evidence-alcohol-accelerates-biological-aging"&gt;Oxford genetic study&lt;/a&gt; showed that just one additional daily drink shortens telomeres equivalently to smoking half a pack of cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4109" data-end="4538"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6715121/"&gt;Facial scanning research&lt;/a&gt; also links eight or more weekly drinks to deeper eye‑bags and volume loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4540" data-end="4845"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4540" data-end="4558"&gt;Swap‑in habit:&lt;/strong&gt; embark on a 60‑day &lt;strong data-start="4578" data-end="4595"&gt;“dry sprint.”&lt;/strong&gt; Replace the ritual, not merely the liquid: use a fancy glass, a sprig of mint, and sparkling water with bitters. I adopted this during a book deadline; my productivity rose, but what shocked me more was how quickly the morning puffiness disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4852" data-end="4880"&gt;6. Talking yourself older&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4882" data-end="5240"&gt;What we say about age becomes a self‑fulfilling prophecy. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10943510/"&gt;Reviews&lt;/a&gt; of older adults show that negative self‑perception predicts lower quality of life and worse health trajectories, independent of actual medical status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4882" data-end="5240"&gt;Neuroscience suggests that internal dialogue shapes stress reactivity and thus cellular aging pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5242" data-end="5542"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5242" data-end="5260"&gt;Swap‑in habit:&lt;/strong&gt; catch ageist self‑talk (“I’m too old for this”) and replace it with &lt;em data-start="5329" data-end="5346"&gt;beginner’s mind&lt;/em&gt; phrases (“I’m still learning this”). Keep a tally in a pocket notebook for 60 days. The practice cultivates &lt;em data-start="5455" data-end="5462"&gt;metta&lt;/em&gt;—loving friendliness toward oneself—and dampens the stress circuits that age us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5549" data-end="5585"&gt;7. Slouching like a question mark&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5587" data-end="5916"&gt;Poor posture doesn’t just hurt; it projects age. &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/in-a-slump-fix-your-posture"&gt;Harvard Health&lt;/a&gt; notes that slumping shortens the spine, crowds lungs, and contributes to the stooped “aged” silhouette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5587" data-end="5916"&gt;Cosmetic clinics&lt;a href="https://www.cutislaserclinics.com/blog/how-poor-posture-can-make-you-look-older/"&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; that forward‑head posture can visually add five to ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5918" data-end="6183"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5918" data-end="5936"&gt;Swap‑in habit:&lt;/strong&gt; attach a posture reminder app or even a strip of kinesiology tape between shoulder blades for tactile feedback. Combine it with twice‑daily “wall angels.” Improved alignment lets breath descend to the diaphragm, energizing both body and presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6190" data-end="6219"&gt;8. Withdrawing from people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6221" data-end="6559"&gt;Loneliness doesn’t just feel heavy; it weighs on DNA. A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03563-4"&gt;2025 &lt;em data-start="6282" data-end="6299"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; paper&lt;/a&gt; found that social disadvantage and isolation accelerate biological aging markers across multiple organ systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6221" data-end="6559"&gt;Humans are wired for &lt;em data-start="6477" data-end="6485"&gt;sangha&lt;/em&gt;—community—because shared presence regulates stress hormones and immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6561" data-end="6789"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6561" data-end="6579"&gt;Swap‑in habit:&lt;/strong&gt; schedule one “pro‑age” connection each week: coffee with a friend, volunteering, or even a group language class (I practice Vietnamese this way). Quality beats quantity, but face‑to‑face beats text every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="6796" data-end="6846"&gt;Bringing it together: a 60‑day renewal roadmap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol data-start="6848" data-end="7235"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6848" data-end="6931"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6851" data-end="6931"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6851" data-end="6862"&gt;Morning&lt;/strong&gt; – five‑minute mindfulness sit, tall posture check, plan 8 k steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6932" data-end="7018"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6935" data-end="7018"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6935" data-end="6950"&gt;Work blocks&lt;/strong&gt; – 30‑minute focus sprints followed by 60‑second breathing resets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7019" data-end="7078"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7022" data-end="7078"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="7022" data-end="7031"&gt;Meals&lt;/strong&gt; – whole‑food plate; zero added sugar drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7079" data-end="7157"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7082" data-end="7157"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="7082" data-end="7093"&gt;Evening&lt;/strong&gt; – screens off by 9 p.m.; journaling cue to rewrite self‑talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7158" data-end="7235"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7161" data-end="7235"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="7161" data-end="7173"&gt;Weekends&lt;/strong&gt; – alcohol‑free social outing that doubles as gentle movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7237" data-end="7428"&gt;Rotate these practices for two lunar cycles and you’ll have clocked roughly &lt;strong data-start="7313" data-end="7346"&gt;90 micro‑changes per behavior&lt;/strong&gt;—enough to ingrain new neural pathways and visibly refresh skin, energy, and mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="7435" data-end="7457"&gt;Closing reflection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7459" data-end="8059"&gt;When people tell me I look younger than the birth date on my passport, I don’t credit genetics; I credit intentional &lt;em data-start="7576" data-end="7588"&gt;letting go&lt;/em&gt;. Aging isn’t the enemy—grasping outdated habits is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7459" data-end="8059"&gt;By renouncing the eight behaviors above, you’re not chasing lost youth; you’re clearing away what obscures the natural vitality already inside you. That, the Buddha might say, is the essence of &lt;em data-start="7835" data-end="7857"&gt;mindful rejuvenation&lt;/em&gt;—and it starts the moment you put this article down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7459" data-end="8059"&gt;Here’s to meeting Day 60 with brighter eyes, steadier breath, and a heart light enough to keep learning, loving, and, yes, looking younger than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;For the good of your health, you might want to favor a wider mix of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid"&gt;flavonoids&lt;/a&gt; in your diet. These natural plant compounds – found in teas, berries, apples, and dark chocolate – have been linked to longer life and a lower risk of disease, new evidence shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, it was the broader range of flavonoids that made a difference in this research, not just the higher quantity of them. Flavonoids have previously been connected to anti-inflammatory effects in the body, and reductions in the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fruits-high-in-flavonoids-are-associated-with-less-weight-gain-study-finds"&gt;weight gain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/daily-tea-consumption-loosens-arteries-to-lower-your-risk-of-cardiovascular-disease"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-fruit-could-reduce-chances-of-eye-disease-macular-degeneration"&gt;vision loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international team of researchers analyzed data on 124,805 adults in the UK, aged 40 or over. They looked for links between the self-reported diets of the participants and their health, over several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have known for some time that higher intakes of dietary flavonoids, powerful bioactives naturally present in many foods and drinks, can reduce the risk of developing heart disease, type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="163563" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and neurological conditions like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="163563" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;," &lt;a href="https://www.ecu.edu.au/newsroom/articles/research/tea-berries-dark-chocolate-and-apples-could-lead-to-a-longer-life-span-study-shows"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; nutritional scientist Aedín Cassidy from Queen's University Belfast in Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study is significant as the results indicate that consuming a higher quantity and wider diversity has the potential to lead to a greater reduction in ill health than just a single source."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-more-green-tea-each-day-cuts-risk-of-dementia-brain-lesions"&gt;green teas&lt;/a&gt; were the most common provider of flavonoids in the study, drunk by two-thirds of the participants. Other sources included apples, red wine, grapes, berries, dark chocolate, oranges, satsumas, and orange juice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_163566" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163566" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/FlavonoidChart.jpg" alt="Flavonoid chart" class="wp-image-163566 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/FlavonoidChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/FlavonoidChart-600x281.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-163566" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers tracked the different flavonoids in food and drink. (Parmenter et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Food&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statistics showed that participants whose diets had the widest diversity of flavonoid foods had a lower risk of &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/all-cause-mortality"&gt;all-cause mortality&lt;/a&gt;, and of numerous health complications. While the data doesn't prove direct cause and effect, the strong suggestion is that mixing your flavonoids is good for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Flavonoid intakes of around 500 milligram a day were associated with a 16 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality, as well as around a 10 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and respiratory disease," &lt;a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/News/Allnews/2025/Teaberriesdarkchocolateandapplescouldleadtoalongerlifespanstudyshows.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; nutrition scientist Benjamin Parmenter from Edith Cowan University in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's roughly the amount of flavonoids that you would consume in two cups of tea."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when consuming the same total amount of flavonoids, those who consumed the widest diversity had even lower risk of these diseases, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top fifth of the participants in terms of diversity of flavonoid intake saw reductions of around 6-20 percent in the risk of conditions like type 2 diabetes,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="163563" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-find-common-link-between-distinct-neurodegenerative-diseases"&gt;neurodegenerative disease&lt;/a&gt;, compared to the bottom fifth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, the researchers are recommending a mix of flavonoid-rich food and drink, every day. If you want to set yourself a challenge, the top flavonoid consumers in this study were snacking on 19 different types per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eating fruits and vegetables in a variety of colors, including those rich in flavonoids, means you're more likely to get the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="163563" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and nutrients you need to sustain a healthier lifestyle," &lt;a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/News/Allnews/2025/Teaberriesdarkchocolateandapplescouldleadtoalongerlifespanstudyshows.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; nutrition scientist Tilman Kuhn from the Medical University of Vienna in Austria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43016-025-01176-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Food&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

While the p.C282Y variant causes dementia through the development of iron overload, the p.H63D variant in the same HFE gene may cause brain inflammation and damage leading to dementia in the absence of overt iron overload, the researchers write. The reason behind the difference in dementia risk between men and women was not clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2025 12:01:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOcHNGY0RBMWlZb1ZwcTVkNkZlYjlJRTFiZlIxSXpzTmkzMmlPazVuUmREY0haZ3liNmExQmZ6RVE0ZWEwbDd3ZllqVGQtQndIV0NZZ0k3VVpaUGRzTUpUeHhDblc0cHJFekoySmlVQ3NCTXhaRDRwZDJCajUxaWQ0VWZ6OXlxTGNwaDJv</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，千禧一代被诊断患有阑尾癌的可能性是其父母的三倍- CNN | Gen X, millennials are about three times more likely than their parents to be diagnosed with appendix cancer, study finds - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxPamIwQlJlaTdEbEg1b0lCd255RXNONWgyd0x4LUZZT3lTMzJFNlluZkd0VG1BT2NsZDNndUllX19VUVpHRmhITFFjb0ZkSkVyR2hhYnBDMElEVkdQcFFrcXV2OS1aRFU0UHZnN3R4V2pqMTZ6VW1YTl9ESGYxWU1tcDIwQjXSAYoBQVVfeXFMUFhZdS1IaERubGlGY2MtY3I5UFRhZ1VxTmxuMmdYREctWjNYemx2MnpSZFFlUl93RDgwNkdZeU8wdXBPejRlcEczRjVlUkpINXlRZDIyNkF4b3NzLTY1SEh3S3lFWmotZV9feXdwNjVRaVJXanFRV0RuZ2FRN2FaWkNEZXRFaDQ3bl9n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            The pain was so sharp that Chris Williams took himself to the hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w00043b6mdro3467z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was a Tuesday evening in September 2021 when Williams started to feel throbbing abdominal pain and nausea. By the next morning, it had gotten worse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w00053b6md1c4h7fy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I had to go to the ER,” said Williams, who lives in Brooklyn.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w00063b6m6y61gfav@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the hospital, he was diagnosed with appendicitis and had his appendix surgically removed. About a week later, he met with his medical team to get the staples removed and discuss next steps – and that’s when he received shocking news.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w00073b6mpzhq3xpd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They found a tumor sitting on my appendix, and they biopsied that tumor and determined it was cancer,” said Williams, who was 48 at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w00083b6m8ctwjn43@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was actually a blessing,” he said. “This was really just a godsend, in my eyes, and a blessing for me to detect the tumor – for the tumor to trigger my appendix to almost rupture for them to find it – because later on, they discovered it was stage III. Had it stayed in me for a while longer, it would have been stage IV,” which is the most advanced stage of cancer and more difficult to treat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w00093b6m2xhaa7kt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Williams, who is now cancer-free after finishing&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;treatment in November 2022, is among a growing group of appendix cancer patients in the United States who were diagnosed at a young age.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The appendix, which plays a role in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1044532318300010" target="_blank"&gt;supporting the immune system&lt;/a&gt;, is a small pouch-like organ that is attached to the large intestine at the lower right side of the abdomen.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000b3b6mddkvxrwv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although cancer of the appendix is rare – typically, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/pediatric-adult-rare-tumor/rare-tumors/rare-digestive-system-tumors/appendiceal-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; to affect about 1 or 2 people for every 1 million in the United States each year – diagnoses are rising sharply among Generation X and millennials, according to a new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000c3b6mb4tazlgp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Compared with people born from 1941 through 1949, incidence rates of appendix cancer have more than tripled among people born between 1976 and 1984 and more than quadrupled among people born between 1981 and 1989, according to research published this week in the &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02479" target="_blank"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. These increases in incidence were found to have occurred from 1975 through 2019.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000d3b6mtitale77@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s alarming overall,” said Dr. Andreana Holowatyj, the lead study author and an assistant professor of hematology and oncology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000e3b6mpqmikkhc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re seeing some of these generational effects for cancers of the colon, the rectum, the stomach, and so that’s one of the reasons why we were curious to explore this in rare appendix cancers. But nonetheless, the rates and trends which we observed were alarming and worrisome,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000f3b6mfwbdwp84@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers on the new study – from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, West Virginia University and the University of Texas Health Science Center – analyzed data on 4,858 people in the United States, 20 or older, who had been diagnosed with appendix cancer between 1975 to 2019. The data came from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000g3b6m4bboku68@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The data was separated into five-year age groups and showed rising rates in appendix cancer incidence by birth cohort, particularly among people born after 1945, the researchers wrote in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000h3b6mpjfb8so3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the new study did not examine specifically why this incidence is on the rise, the researchers say it’s “unlikely” to be explained by advances in screening for the disease or diagnostic tools.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000i3b6mhh1drxq8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are no standardized screening techniques for appendiceal cancers. Many of them are incidentally found after presentation of something like acute appendicitis,” Holowatyj said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000j3b6mrfro0amy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rather, the trend may be tied to “environmental exposures that may increase risk for generations now entering mid-adulthood,” the researchers wrote. And similar trends “have also been reported for colon, rectal, and gastric cancer,” suggesting that possible risk factors may contribute to gastrointestinal cancers as a whole.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000k3b6m4uogg5q2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For instance, obesity has been identified as a risk factor for appendix cancer diagnoses and is recognized as a risk factor for colon cancer, Holowatyj said, adding that identifying what risk factors might be driving these trends in cancer incidence could help reveal ways to prevent disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000l3b6mntooqoga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The fact that we’re seeing these trends parallel across other cancers of the gastrointestinal tract does tell us, or suggest, that there may be both shared and distinct risk factors that can contribute to cancer development across younger generations in the gastrointestinal tract,” Holowatyj said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000m3b6mv69jjsst@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That’s going to be important to understand – what are those shared factors, or how do those risk factors differ, both in magnitude and absolute risk across these gastrointestinal cancer types – to help us support the development of effective prevention strategies and ultimately aim to reduce this burden or reverse these trends,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000n3b6mz23jyyzi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are no specific screening recommendations for appendix cancers, but &lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2025.43.4_suppl.824" target="_blank"&gt;symptoms of the disease&lt;/a&gt; typically include abdominal or pelvic pain, bloating, nausea and vomiting – which often can mimic symptoms of appendicitis. Appendix cancer may be treated with surgery, in which the appendix is removed. If the cancer has spread, patients are often given chemotherapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000o3b6mkrstfp0b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is a disease where, if not caught before the appendix ruptures, tumor cells disperse throughout the abdominal cavity often,” Holowatyj said. “That’s why up to 1 in every 2 patients are diagnosed with metastatic disease” or cancer that has spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000z3b6modgr7gx5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study showing an increase in incidence of appendix cancer among younger adults comes as no surprise to Dr. Andrea Cercek, co-director of the Center for Early Onset Colorectal and GI Cancers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who treated Williams.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w00103b6mtsyesa0r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve known that early-onset appendix cancer is part of the bigger story of early-onset GI cancers, including colorectal cancer,” said Cercek, who was not involved in the new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w00113b6m8sv1gjll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She has seen the trend firsthand among her own patients – but it still remains unclear what specific factors may be driving these increases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w00123b6m72ijf8ut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are a lot of suspects, including lifestyle changes, dietary changes. People talk about obesity, less activity. But there’s nothing that quite fits everyone. And then there are environmental changes,” Cercek said. “I think it’s probably some type of combination, something multifactorial, but we have not yet identified it. There is thankfully now a lot of work, a lot of research going into this.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w00133b6m5dyitk8v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite the rising incidence, Cercek emphasized that appendix cancers remain uncommon.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w00143b6mwsnhbv64@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is very rare, even though it’s rising,” she said. “However, it is an important part of this overarching story of the rise in cancer in young adults.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000q3b6mti75d71t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Williams’ journey after his cancer diagnosis was not easy, he said, but he remains grateful for his care team. After he was diagnosed, he sought treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, where he underwent additional surgery and received chemotherapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000r3b6mxfjg084o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For me, I could look at it in a couple of different ways. I could moan. I could complain. I could say, ‘Woe is me.’ Or I could be grateful that this was found and that there was a solution in terms of treatment,” Williams said. “It could have ended up being something that killed me, and because it didn’t, I feel like I have everything to be grateful for.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000s3b6ma88si8ey@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before his cancer diagnosis, Williams thought he was doing everything right. He was eating a mostly healthy diet and exercising regularly, but as a project manager at the time&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for the state of New York, he also was experiencing a lot of stress.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000t3b6mgx8ej1sl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At age 42, he had his first heart attack, he said. He had a second heart attack a few weeks after his appendix cancer diagnosis. Then a third happened shortly after his surgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, he said. And just last year, Williams had a fourth heart attack. Blockages were found in his heart, and he said he was treated with stenting, in which a flexible tube was placed in the arteries to increase blood flow to the heart.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000u3b6mcstvob1h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A lot of what I’ve experienced has been due to stress,” Williams said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000v3b6m63ydgh9i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My personality has been one where I internalized a lot. Especially among men, we tend to internalize a lot because we feel like we have to carry the weight of the world on our shoulders,” he said. “But in so doing, as you’re internalizing, you’re making yourself sick. That internalization leads to stress, and that can lead to heart disease, that can lead to strokes, that can lead to cancer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000w3b6md9uvzspb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Inspired by his own health challenges, Williams has launched the Brooklyn-based nonprofit Heart, Body &amp;amp; Soul to connect communities of color, particularly Black men in underserved communities, with physical and mental health tools as well as increased communication with health care providers to help improve their overall health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000x3b6mvbap2py9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We also teach them how to advocate for themselves as well because a big part of the challenges that are faced, especially when having conversations with men of color, is the concern of not being seen or heard when they get into a hospital,” Williams said, adding that he emphasizes the importance of listening to your body and having a primary care physician.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscsv1w000y3b6mjsfba8kt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Especially in the age where we see things happening like men and women being diagnosed at earlier ages with various diseases, I really think it’s important for us to start prioritizing putting a care team together,” he said. “We have to take a more holistic approach to how we treat ourselves and how we take care of ourselves.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
