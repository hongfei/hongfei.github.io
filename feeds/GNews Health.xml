However, the new immuno-based treatment would only require a single step — immunotherapy — to treat the cancer by teaching a person’s immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hundred and three patients participated in the study, 54 with a variety of "solid tumor cancers," including stomach, endometrial and prostate, and 49 with rectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers shared in a &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/news/using-only-immunotherapy-successfully-treats-several-cancers-with-mmrd-mutation-improves-quality-of-life" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:press release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center that of the 54 patients with a “variety of cancers," 35 had “all signs of their cancer” disappear and were using the immuno-based treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith Collection/Gado/Getty &lt;/p&gt; Sign with logo on the facade of the Memorial Sloan Kettering cancer center in Manhattan, New York City, New York, among the top cancer hospitals in the world, September 14, 2017.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/milk-might-lower-womans-risk-of-colorectal-cancer-study-8772735" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Refrigerator Staple Might Lower a Woman's Risk of Colorectal Cancer, New Study Says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Refrigerator Staple Might Lower a Woman's Risk of Colorectal Cancer, New Study Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the release, Dr. Andrea Cercek said, "Nearly 2 out of 3 patients with types of cancer other than rectal were able to preserve their organs and their quality of life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a very significant response, and the results were even better than we had hoped,” Dr. Cercek said. “We found that some cancer types responded extremely well to the immunotherapy, including colon and stomach cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center&lt;/p&gt; Maureen Sideris, seated, with her sister Marion, receiving the 8th of 9 immunotherapy infusions during successful treatment for early-stage gastroesophageal junction cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maureen Sideris, a patient who was diagnosed with gastroesophageal junction cancer in 2022 and participated in the study, said that the treatment had worked successfully for her, according to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My husband, Tommy, and I were preparing for the worst,” she recalled in a statement. “But after being treated with only immunotherapy, I had no evidence of cancer and didn’t have to undergo surgery or chemo or radiation. I felt like I won the lottery!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cerek reported that “20% of non-rectal cancer patients” who still had to undergo surgery “saw lower rates of cancer recurrence." She said this suggests that “even if the effect wasn’t a home run, it helped most patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/radiation-from-ct-scans-performed-in-just-1-year-could-lead-to-over-100000-future-cancer-diagnoses-study-finds-11715344" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Radiation from CT Scans Performed in Just 1 Year Could Lead to Over 100,000 Future Cancer Diagnoses, Study Finds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Radiation from CT Scans Performed in Just 1 Year Could Lead to Over 100,000 Future Cancer Diagnoses, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; A man pouring medications out of a bottle into his hand.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for all 49 patients with rectal cancer who participated in the study, “there was no evidence of cancer after immunotherapy,” according to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center release. Researchers said that one patient had a “growth in a lymph node” that was surgically removed but they “kept their rectum.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, researchers said that the new treatment comes with its own drawbacks as the immunotherapy drug appeared to only work well with patients who had mismatch repair-deficiency, which means certain cells have mutations when cancer cells separate, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/mismatch-repair-deficiency" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Cancer Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; (NCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the NCI, this mutation “is most common” in “colorectal cancer, other types of gastrointestinal cancer, and endometrial cancer" and can also be found in “cancers of the breast, prostate, bladder and thyroid.” The immunotherapy drug works by targeting cells with this mutation, as the immunotherapy drug can more easily target the many mutations, per the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re really excited to help more people,” Dr. Cercek said. “And we are already exploring why rectal tissue seems to have such an extraordinary response to immunotherapy and how we can use that knowledge to help with other cancer types.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/immunotherapy-breakthrough-could-mean-fewer-cancer-patients-need-chemo-11724110" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 22:05:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQYW0wMm9VT3B3ckN3TGktR3Y1VXlpSmhHR1lKWVp6WUZEczdFRHFsSURVMjNocWduQlpLXzFRbDVmVmlTQUNxeVZUamwyQVBhNC1mOEVyT0lYaW9HZzlTY1RSVDh0THNfV0Fac29fclhKSFgxVW9jX0xmQVBtUUlrTmctY21SQQ</guid></item><item><title>HHS吹捧通用流感，冠状病毒疫苗计划，同时对季节性Covid-19疫苗的未来表示怀疑- CNN | HHS touts universal flu, coronavirus vaccine initiative while casting doubt on future of seasonal Covid-19 shots - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPMUV4UDhZczFpbklBcDZka3dTZE1zMFBFdVVONlBkNFN3c0hXR3VFMWNrUG81MDc5ZGJBcDlMYURXa0pnRU1pb01ZZ1ozcW9OWGlnazQtMHJOclB5c0pUSnRkRTRyYmUtNUl6bW5xcTdsNlJmcUJsalJ1UHpKaU56ZTVORlVNRllacTROeS1Hc9IBlAFBVV95cUxOZ0ZUY2xTYjVoOEJfcGJaZVZVV1lQYk5xVFJBYzNxTGdTVVZnQzVMMXIwbmlWRVZ5UHFaSms2UDhRN3lmMXNzZHVCZURwVHVwVlJrM1NzN2phZTRmRGVVaUJVZkt6SXZ1LXRHRU1rUDJzSTJianpvMFdCTUxEM25YRmtMSDNndGZQSkx5c3hpSWZPekhk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            The US Department of Health and Human Services said Thursday that it aims to accomplish within four years a scientific feat that hasn’t been achieved&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for the past 45: the development of a universal flu vaccine that could protect against multiple virus strains with pandemic potential, including H5N1 avian influenza.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00022e6a0aeu0g9q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Generation Gold Standard is a paradigm shift,” National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said in a &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-nih-announces-generation-gold-standard.html" target="_blank"&gt;statement &lt;/a&gt;on the new initiative. “It extends vaccine protection beyond strain-specific limits and prepares for flu viral threats – not just today’s, but tomorrow’s as well – using traditional vaccine technology brought into the 21st century.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00032e6a61zknvgv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS said the project, being developed in-house at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is targeting US Food and Drug Administration approval of universal influenza vaccines in 2029, with human clinical trials scheduled to start next year. The Wall Street Journal first reported that it will be funded with $500 million from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a figure confirmed by a spokesperson for HHS.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00042e6aqpdv4zvk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I hope it works,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine scientist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. He noted that he trained in a flu lab in the early 1980s that was working on a universal flu vaccine, and one still hasn’t been developed. “It’s not for lack of effort, and it’s not for lack of expertise, and it’s not for lack of money that we don’t have a universal influenza vaccine. It’s just really hard to do.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00052e6adojvt4q1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu viruses are wily because they mutate from season to season, sometimes significantly, and because efforts to protect against all – or many – strains at once haven’t succeeded, we get updated flu shots each year to protect us against the latest circulating strains.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00062e6aua4xa41p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A similar paradigm has unfolded for Covid-19 vaccines since they were first authorized in the height of the pandemic at the end of 2020. HHS’s new initiative also aims to develop universal coronavirus vaccines that could provide protection against not just the virus that causes Covid-19 – SARS-CoV-2 – but its cousins SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00072e6abhm5b8uh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vaccine technology in HHS’s new initiative uses inactivated whole-virus vaccines, an older approach that delivers an entire virus that’s been chemically tweaked so it can’t infect human cells. The project comes from work being driven by Dr. Matthew Memoli, the NIH’s principal deputy director, and Dr. Jeffery Taubenberger, acting director of NIAID.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00082e6avjt9q1u8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Memoli, who &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/24/health/nih-interim-director-memoli/index.html"&gt;gained attention&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 for opposing Covid-19 vaccine mandates and reportedly declined Covid-19 vaccination himself, said in &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/trial-potential-universal-flu-vaccine-opens-nih-clinical-center" target="_blank"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt; that one of the vaccines being advanced in this project, which can potentially be administered through a squirt up the nose, is an attempt “to induce a comprehensive immune response that closely mimics immunity gained following a natural influenza infection.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00092e6aln93g0hb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccine experts who are not involved in the project said universal flu and coronavirus vaccines are a worthy goal, but they questioned whether this project could produce one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000a2e6a6djbjb6o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Greg Poland, who directs the vaccine research group at the Mayo Clinic, said the accepted scientific definition of a universal flu vaccine is one that would provide at least 75% protection against symptomatic infection with both A and B strain flu viruses for at least a year, and preferably over multiple seasons, for all age groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000b2e6ase877hqe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Poland says &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abo2167" target="_blank"&gt;research that’s been published&lt;/a&gt; on the most advanced candidate in the new initiative, BPL-1357, describes a vaccine that contains inert versions of four A-strain avian influenza viruses but doesn’t include any B-strain viruses, “which tells me they’re not aiming at seasonal viruses,” he said. “They’re aiming at those viruses that have the potential for pandemicity,” or the potential to start pandemics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000c2e6av2p3aj0z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Poland said he was also surprised by the amount of money being devoted to a vaccine technology that science has largely moved away from.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000d2e6a30iclfc8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Why would we devise a major program and devote a tremendous amount of resources to an old platform?” he asked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5qxpnw00003b6mscvltou0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The advantage of using whole viruses is that they give the body a chance to develop antibodies to many parts of a virus, which tends to create long-lasting protection, even if some parts of the virus mutate. But they can also cause unwanted side effects and adverse reactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5rvfok00003b6mcv0d3ny1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whole virus vaccines are typically grown in chicken eggs or cells. In this case, the vaccines under study are grown in canine kidney cells. Those viruses are treated with a chemical called beta-propiolactone, which prevents them from being able to copy themselves in the body and infect cells. The inactivated viruses are then purified and mixed into a shot or nasal spray.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5r6xwi00023b6mgwt4faw9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US used to use flu vaccines made from whole inactivated viruses but has since &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8473132/" target="_blank"&gt;moved to safer options&lt;/a&gt;, such as subunit or split virus vaccines, which use only a part of the flu virus to create an immune response. Flumist, a nasal spray, uses a whole but weakened version of the virus, so it’s not completely inactivated. Inactivated whole-virus flu vaccines are still used in some other countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000e2e6avupyvwey@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Poland and another vaccine expert, Dr. Peter Hotez, director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital, said whole-virus vaccines were once more common, but developers moved away from them because they produce inoculations that are sometimes too strong and can provoke dangerous immune reactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5t2pa0000g3b6mi9g3nlmi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m guessing it’s going to be quite reactogenic,” Hotez said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000f2e6ald1wh0wn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He pointed to the 1976 swine flu vaccine, which produced a strong immune response to the whole virus it contained but also caused high rates of Guillain-Barré syndrome, an immune disorder in which the body attacks its own nerves and muscles, causing muscle weakness and paralysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000g2e6ax8dtflg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other whole-virus vaccines, including the first ones developed to fight respiratory syncytial virus or RSV, have caused problems such as immune enhancement, where exposure to the virus after vaccination makes the infection more dangerous, not less.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000h2e6aoccdpuuk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a bit of a head-scratcher why they have so much confidence in a whole inactivated virus approach. I don’t quite understand that,” Hotez said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5r89m1000b3b6m5v7vvzeg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Just before it announced its new universal vaccine development plan, late Wednesday HHS threw into question the future of seasonally updated Covid-19 vaccines. The agency said in a statement that “all new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure – a radical departure from past practices.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000o2e6aoa2obk0u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The FDA typically selects strains for updated Covid-19 vaccines in June so manufacturers can ready them for the fall respiratory virus season. The agency has adopted a system similar to the one used for flu vaccines, holding previously that updating only the strain targeted by the vaccine – and nothing else – didn’t represent a change big enough to require new human trials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000p2e6aoprfax5m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If HHS now requires placebo-controlled trials before clearing updated Covid-19 vaccines, experts said, that could delay availability of the shots by months, putting vulnerable people at risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000q2e6a7m4zlnyi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The advantage of updating the vaccine every year to make it more close to the circulating strain is, you get better antibody responses, so for four to six months, you will clearly have better protection against mild to moderate disease, and that matters especially for people who are more frail,” particularly people 75 and older, Offit said.

            A spokesperson for HHS didn’t respond to an inquiry about whether the new guidance pertains to updated Covid-19 vaccines, but an official told CNN on Saturday that “the covid vaccines, including new ones by Pfizer and Moderna, are new and must have more gold standard science to ensure safety and efficacy for the public.” The official drew a distinction from the flu shot, “which has been tried and tested” for decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Questions about the fate of Covid vaccines began to swirl after the FDA missed an April 1 deadline to decide whether to grant full approval to the Novavax vaccine, the only non-mRNA vaccine available to protect against the coronavirus. A source familiar with the situation, who wasn’t authorized to speak on behalf of the agency, told CNN that the vaccine had been on track to be approved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000t2e6azkl4nqga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Novavax later &lt;a href="https://ir.novavax.com/press-releases/Latest-update-on-U-S-FDA-BLA-for-Novavaxs-COVID-19-Vaccine-1" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://ir.novavax.com/press-releases/Latest-update-on-U-S-FDA-BLA-for-Novavaxs-COVID-19-Vaccine-1" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;the FDA had requested a “postmarketing commitment” for a clinical trial, suggesting that a study would be required of the vaccine after it received full approval (it had been available through emergency use authorization since 2022). HHS’s newest statement adds to questions about whether a trial would be required before approval, not just for Novavax’s vaccine but also for updated versions of those from Moderna and Pfizer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In a conference call with Wall Street analysts Thursday, Moderna President Dr. Stephen Hoge insisted that the company’s interactions with the FDA so far have been “business as usual” and emphasized the “real need for Covid vaccination, particularly this coming fall.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr000v2e6av1k4m2ds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Covid-19 has become less deadly since the height of the pandemic as the population developed widespread immunity through both infection and vaccination, but the virus still kills and can be especially dangerous for the elderly. Between September 2023 and August 2024, there were more than 36,000 deaths from Covid-19 among people 65 and older, CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-04-15-16/05-Panagiotakopoulos-COVID-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-04-15-16/05-Panagiotakopoulos-COVID-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;showed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr000w2e6aia4llo2e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This month may reveal whether the FDA shares Moderna’s “business as usual” approach. The company is expecting FDA decisions on a next-generation Covid-19 vaccine by May 31 and on an expansion of approval for its RSV vaccine into younger ages by June 12. It said an FDA decision on its combination flu and Covid-19 vaccine would be pushed back from the end of this year to 2026, as the agency said it requires efficacy data on the flu component to support the application.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr000x2e6ax3c6uzlh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The company also said it’s going to “de-prioritize” development of the combination flu and Covid-19 vaccine for people under the age of 50, instead focusing on advancing it for older adults, as it shifts some resources to cancer therapies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cma5pxsao001f2e6a9lnjwg4e@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="changing-standards-may-delay-shots" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Changing standards may delay shots
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr000y2e6a0gl1hpeq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If the FDA does require placebo-controlled trials before approving updated seasonal Covid-19 vaccines, experts said, it will signal a new standard.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr000z2e6agyz844vg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “FDA clearly, after a deliberative process, adopted an approach that treated Covid-19 vaccine boosters like influenza boosters, not like a new product, and held to that over a few years,” said Dorit Reiss, a professor of law at UC Law San Francisco. “They adopted a standard, and now they’re changing it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr00102e6afm9653dn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The agency does appear to be moving forward at least with the process of selecting strains; it’s asked its group of outside advisers to hold May 22 as a date to meet to discuss them, according to a person who viewed the communication who wasn’t authorized to speak on behalf of the FDA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr00112e6amljitbmi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In its statement Wednesday, HHS also claimed that current systems for monitoring vaccine safety, including the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and the Vaccine Safety Datalink, don’t capture vaccine injuries sufficiently and “have become templates of regulatory malpractice.” HHS said it’s building surveillance systems now “that will accurately measure vaccine risks as well as benefits.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr00122e6a51qqpznu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccine experts pushed back on the assertion that those systems are insufficient. And the plan to build a different surveillance system appeared to come into direct conflict with a pledge that Sen. Bill Cassidy said HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made to secure his confirmation vote in February.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr00132e6a5yy5upio@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, Cassidy &lt;a href="https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-delivers-floor-speech-in-support-of-rfk-jr-to-be-hhs-secretary/" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at the time, has “committed that he would work within the current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems, and not establish parallel systems.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr00142e6au5v8nza2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cassidy, a Republican doctor from Louisiana, did not respond to CNN’s request for comment Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration looks to be surrendering in the war against germs. A new report from Wired reveals the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has shuttered a federal lab dedicated to studying some of the deadliest infectious diseases in the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Wired’s report, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/hhs-niaid-irf-ebola-disease-research-stop/"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday, the Integrated Research Facility in Frederick, Maryland was ordered to completely cease its experimental research by April 29. The facility has long researched the treatment and prevention of “high consequence” infectious diseases, including Ebola and Lassa fever. The facility’s ultimate fate is uncertain at this time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/frederick-integrated-research-facility#:~:text=It%20is%20one%20of%20the%20few%20facilities%20in%20the%20world%20able%20to%20perform%20medical%20imaging%20to%20evaluate%20animals%20in%20BSL%2D4%20containment"&gt;Integrated Research Facility&lt;/a&gt; operates under the umbrella of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). It hosts one of the dozen research laboratories in North America allowed to handle germs that meet the criteria for Biosafety Level 4, the highest level of containment; it’s also one of the few places in the entire world where scientists can perform medical imaging on BSL-4 infected animals. BSL-4 pathogens typically cause severe or fatal illness, may be able to spread easily in a lab setting, and have few or no available treatments or vaccines. These pathogens include the viruses that cause Ebola and Lassa, as well as the reconstructed flu virus that caused the 1918 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Wired viewed an email sent by Michael Holbrook, associate director for high containment at the Integrated Research Facility, that detailed the facility’s shuttering. Holbrook reportedly told employees that the facility will be explicitly ending its studies on Lassa fever, SARS-Cov-2, and Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-rare-deadly-mosquito-virus-has-emerged-in-new-york-2000503317"&gt;rare but often deadly mosquitoborne virus&lt;/a&gt; found in the U.S. Northeast. The animals used for these studies, however, will not be euthanized. He added that officials from the Department of Homeland Security would padlock the freezers used for BSL-4 research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The sacrifice to research is immense,” Gigi Kwik Gronvall, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Wired. “If things are unused for a period of time, it will cost more money to get them ready to be used again.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The HHS’s closing of the Integrated Research Facility shouldn’t come as a complete surprise. After President Donald Trump’s election win last November, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—who has since become HHS chief—promised that he would try to &lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2024/11/15/trump-pick-rfk-jr-promises-to-end-infectious-disease-research-on-week-one-video.html"&gt;shut down infectious disease research&lt;/a&gt; at the National Institutes of Health as soon as Trump took office. During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy also &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-says-government-ignores-chronic-disease-misguided-rcna190042"&gt;(wrongly) claimed&lt;/a&gt; that federal funding on infectious diseases far outweighed the money spent studying chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;When contacted by Wired, a NIH spokesperson characterized the facility’s closing as a “research pause” and appeared to blame staff members for the shutdown, though without any further details. Notably, the facility’s director, Connie Schmaljohn, was also put on administrative leave.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This decision follows identification and documentation of personnel issues involving contract staff that compromised the facility’s safety culture, prompting this research pause,” Bradley Moss, communication director for the office of research services at NIH, told Wired.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The government’s stated rationale for pausing work at the Integrated Research Facility might merit some skepticism, however, given how unorganized and destructive the supposed “restructuring” of HHS being carried out by RFK Jr. has gone to date. And seeing as we’re still fresh off the worst pandemic seen in over a century, any sustained pause in infectious disease research is likely to be bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Kennedy Jr. announced a plan that would require placebo-controlled studies for all new vaccines, surprising some experts who noted that such testing already routinely took place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In a statement, Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said that “all new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials” before approval, and called the move a “radical departure” from existing standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Even though modern studies routinely use placebos,&lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;one exception has been the Covid booster shots, which have been authorized without human trials to target new strains of the virus as it has evolved. It’s unclear how the announcement will affect availability of Covid vaccines that were expected to be updated for the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Kennedy also announced an effort Thursday for the National Institutes of Health to turbocharge the development of new inoculations for Covid, bird flu and seasonal flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The new vaccine development initiative would involve methods other than the mRNA technology used to develop the dominant Covid vaccines that are already in use, a statement from the Health and Human Services department said. The mRNA shots have been the subject of conspiracy theories, and Mr. Kennedy has intensely criticized them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Taken together, the moves suggest that Mr. Kennedy will reach far into the details of vaccine development, an effort likely informed by his decades as one of the nation’s most vocal critics of immunization oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

To require a placebo group would deny those patients access to the vaccine that has already been found safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SMND7JTT5RHDXOPUTWBGRZ7NWA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Claiming vaccines have risks the data doesn’t show or trying to overstate vaccine risks is not transparency,” said Dorit Reiss, a professor at the University of California College of the Law at San Francisco who tracks public health vaccine law. “It’s misinformation, and it undermines real transparency and informed consent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KXIWMZDR5ZEUVHSKQZPBYEIXLI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Additionally, many vaccines have been tested against placebos, the experts said. And while HHS said the trials would be for “new vaccines,” if Kennedy tries to test vaccines that have already been approved, such as the measles vaccine, against a placebo, that would mean in practice some children would not get vaccinated against the infectious disease while their neighbors did — a quandary that physicians say leaves them susceptible to diseases when there is a vaccine that works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C5M36GTHZNBPZMSIJA3PFGT32Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Stanley Plotkin, a pioneer in the field who developed the rubella vaccine, said that when scientists test vaccines against a new disease, they typically look for evidence that the vaccinated individuals do not get a disease, compared with those who received a placebo. This is how the coronavirus vaccines were tested, in 30,000-person trials in which half of the participants received saline shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K6DDLGDNN5EFJP32D7DBKFU63I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But when a disease is already well understood, scientists can look for evidence that vaccines induce a biological response that has been scientifically shown to protect against the disease — what scientists call “a correlate of protection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RN77H467VZETRGSI5GBTAN7MII" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the case of diseases that cause serious illness and can even be fatal, if there are existing interventions, the use of placebos is often not considered ethical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="45JUNSUM5VDX7AFUE4X225PHCE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Ethics must be taken into account when you set up a study,” Plotkin said. “Can I ethically agree to having people acquire the disease because they receive a placebo?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="API2WOOX5BERHI6B3Z65RNLP44" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="API2WOOX5BERHI6B3Z65RNLP44" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Coronavirus vaccine in play?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YC5YSNXK4RBJZIOJM242X6KVFQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The administration has taken aim at reexamining the coronavirus vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AYNJD2OOKJECJCIE5LRIYT4JNY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When asked by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0lzUuxmH4w"&gt;CBS News on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; whether the Food and Drug Administration plans to green-light updates to the coronavirus shots, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency was “taking a look.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2QKKP4VXPNELBALY3WTUOOZCMQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We have a bit of a public trust problem,” Makary said. “I think there’s a void of data.

The company’s shot has been available under emergency use authorization and is the only vaccine that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/07/13/novavax-coronavirus-vaccine-fda-authorizes/"&gt;uses a more traditional protein base&lt;/a&gt; instead of messenger RNA — an appealing option to some who have reactions to mRNA shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5BZJEKNYN5EYVJPIRVRE3A232I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The FDA was on track to grant full approval to the vaccine April 1, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal deliberations. Top Trump FDA officials told agency regulators to pause the approval, these sources said — which some vaccine experts say amounts to political interference into decisions typically made by career staff tasked with reviewing the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="25KKAGDVKD3JX9EMX8DDNG0NF8" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“To be clear, this is a new product that Novavax is trying to introduce to the market with a study of a different product from 2021. New products require new clinical studies,” Makary wrote Saturday &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrMakaryFDA/status/1916253910039429309"&gt;in a post on X.&lt;/a&gt; Several vaccine experts dismiss the notion that the vaccine constitutes a new product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IA32VGHOIFHHBO3BQA6J7GLEW4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Such a move would be costly and suggests a potential shift in how the agency may approach coronavirus vaccines going forward. Typically, Pfizer and Moderna get instructions from the FDA on how to update their vaccines in June. It’s unclear whether they will need to run new clinical trials for their vaccines, which would be unlikely to occur before the annual coronavirus shot in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U2UKR6DSAVA2NHAY2IS6TAH6JY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“While we cannot comment on this specifically, we look forward to continued collaboration with the Administration and teams across HHS,” said Chris Ridley, a spokesman for Moderna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KX43SDV77FBF7FYSICJWRW2AFE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Medical experts The Post spoke to predicted that the change by Kennedy could limit new vaccines approved under his watch, as well as slow investment by pharmaceutical companies.

			&lt;p&gt;There's a lot going on in the teeming &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-people-in-your-life-are-sharing-their-gut-microbes-with-you"&gt;microbiomes of our guts&lt;/a&gt;, and we're regularly making new discoveries about these bustling miniature ecosystems – including a new study identifying a symbiotic fungus that could fight liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fungus in question is &lt;i&gt;Fusarium foetens&lt;/i&gt;, and researchers led by a team from Peking University in China found that in mouse models, it was effective in stopping a fatty liver disease known as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22988-nonalcoholic-steatohepatitis"&gt;metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis&lt;/a&gt; or MASH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More precisely, it was the compound FF-C1 produced by &lt;i&gt;F. foetens&lt;/i&gt; that made the difference. Mice with a MASH-like disease treated with the fungus showed significant improvements in liver health, including lower inflammation levels and less scarring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_159629" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159629" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/EnzymeAnalysis.jpg" alt="Enzyme analysis" class="wp-image-159629 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/EnzymeAnalysis.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/EnzymeAnalysis-335x415.jpg 335w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/EnzymeAnalysis-600x744.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-159629" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The team studied the chemical reactions triggered by the fungus in mice. (Zhou et al., &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Several observations have shown that bacteria and fungi interact in the gut, where they influence each other through varying degrees of symbiosis," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adp5540"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our model is that elevation of &lt;i&gt;F. foetens&lt;/i&gt; in the gut leads to the generation of FF-C1, which enters the intestinal epithelia by an unclear mechanism."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having collected stool samples from 100 people across different parts of China, the team used a newly developed method for isolating and growing the different species of fungus potentially present in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-contain-a-variety-of-microbiomes-heres-a-look-at-a-few-of-the-most-important"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt; of these volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That gave the researchers 161 different species of fungi. The ubiquity of &lt;i&gt;F. foetens&lt;/i&gt; in the samples, and its ability to adapt to low-oxygen environments, made it a prime candidate for further experiments in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as identifying the benefits for liver health, the study also outlined part of the way the fungus appears to be working: it seems the FF-C1 chemical dampens the activity of an enzyme called Ceramide Synthase 6 (CerS6), which lives in the lining of the gut and helps produce &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramide"&gt;fats in the blood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less CerS6 means it's less likely that MASH will get started or progress. The researchers backed up their hypothesis by genetically engineering mice to develop without any CerS6, or with too much of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We validated the role of CerS6 in &lt;i&gt;F. foetens&lt;/i&gt;–mediated amelioration of MASH in mice by intestinal-specific Cers6 deletion and overexpression," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adp5540"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results still need to be repeated in human trials of course, but further down the line, its possible these findings will inspire new treatments. Almost &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41575-023-00846-4"&gt;1 in 3 people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide have metabolic dysfunction–associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), a group of conditions that includes MASH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given how busy our guts are in terms of bacteria and fungi, it's likely that many more similar discoveries are waiting to be made – whether that's microbes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/toxin-secreting-yeast-may-be-behind-some-forms-of-gut-inflammation"&gt;that are causing disease&lt;/a&gt;, or protecting us from them. The same techniques used here could be deployed to identify more helpful fungi in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Optimizing culture techniques and medium composition for gut fungi is essential for understanding intestinal microecology and will yield deeper insights into host-gut microbiota cross-talk," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adp5540"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adp5540"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;IRVING PARK — A confirmed measles case has been found in a Chicago resident, and another was found in a suburban Cook County resident, health officials announced Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the first two measles cases this year in Cook County, according to a news release from the city and county health departments. The agencies are coordinating to investigate, identify and notify people who might have been exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is relatively rare in the Chicago area; last year, an outbreak marked the &lt;a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/05/30/measles-outbreak-in-chicago-contained-city-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"&gt;first time Chicago had a confirmed measles case since 2019&lt;/a&gt;. That outbreak — with the majority of cases found among people staying at shelters for migrants — was contained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chicago is no stranger to measles after our outbreak last spring, and having contained it once, we know we can do it again,” Chicago health commissioner Dr. Olusimbo Ige said in the release. The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine “is an extremely effective tool for combatting illness and saving lives in our community. It’s never too late to get vaccinated and protect yourself from measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s first confirmed case was found in a Chicago adult who traveled internationally through O’Hare Airport in early April. They developed a rash April 25 and have been isolating at home since being diagnosed, according to the health departments. The adult had received one dose of the MMR vaccine; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, two doses are recommended for the best protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other case was found in a suburban Cook County adult whose vaccination status is unknown. The person went to a local hospital for medical care April 28 and was isolated after the illness was identified, according to the health departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who were at these locations April 21-28 might have been exposed, according to the agency:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;April 21 at Fittingly Delicious, 3939 W. Irving Park Road&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;10 a.m.-8 p.m. April 22 at O’Hare Airport, especially Terminal 1&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;10 a.m.-8 p.m. April 23 at O’Hare Airport, especially Terminal 1&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;10 a.m.-12:30 p.m. April 25 at Aldi, 7235 39th St. in Lyons&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;10 a.m.-12:30 p.m. April 27 at Shell, 3901 S. Harlem Ave. in Stickney &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;10:20 a.m.-1 p.m. April 28 at Mobil, 2945 S. Harlem Ave. in Berwyn&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials initially warned about an April 21 exposure at the Chicago Public Library Independence Branch, 4024 N. Elston Ave. But by Thursday, investigators determined the person with measles did not visit the location, and no additional action needs to be taken by people who visited the library that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles include rash, high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes, according to the health department. It can take seven to 21 days for symptoms to appear after a person is exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone presenting symptoms of measles should call their doctor or an emergency department before going there in person so staff can make arrangements to protect other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-to-know-about-measles"&gt;What To Know About Measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is rare in Chicago because there is a high vaccination rate in the city, but reports of cases have increased in the United States in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being fully immunized with the MMR vaccine is the most effective way to protect against being infected by and spreading the virus, Dr. Sameer Vohra, Illinois Department of Public Health director, said in the news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vaccine is widely available to people 1 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The MMR vaccine is safe and effective. We encourage anyone who is unvaccinated, or under-vaccinated, to speak with their medical provider and take appropriate steps to get up to date on the recommended shots,” Vohra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious and can be dangerous for unvaccinated people, particularly babies and young children, health department officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illness spreads easily through the air. When an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes, the virus can remain in a room for up to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complications from measles can lead to pneumonia, seizures, hearing loss, life-long brain damage and death, according to health department officials.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Misinformation has contributed to declining vaccination rates and fueled recent outbreaks” of measles, said Dr. Kiran Joshi, interim Cook County health department COO. “The MMR vaccine has been in use for over 50 years, is highly effective and has protected millions of lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-primary-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-primary-background-color has-background is-style-wide"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to the Block Club Chicago podcast:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;/div&gt;

In the beginning, she didn’t take the sport too seriously. “I went to practice, but I usually ran whatever was the shortest option available,” she recalls. Back then, she says, running was a “good, healthy” part of her life. But after a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/how-to-break-up-with-someone.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;difficult breakup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; in her senior year of high school, her approach changed. She started using exercise as a way to cope with emotional pain and soon became competitive about her race times. &lt;/em&gt;“&lt;em&gt;I was probably doing a three- or four-mile run five days a week,” she says. Around the same time, a friend announced she was giving up &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/05/new-nutrition-labels-will-call-out-percentage-of-added-sugar.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;processed sugar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and Kelly remembers saying, “Oh, cool, I’ll do that with you.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma467qql000v3b6dmz0o9u2b@published" data-word-count="72"&gt;&lt;em&gt;That dietary change “flipped a switch,” says Kelly, who is now a brand-strategy consultant on the West Coast. “It triggered more restrictions.” Up until then, Kelly had eaten fairly intuitively. She had never felt critical of her body. But giving up sugar made her newly health-conscious. “I ate like somebody who needed to lose weight, but I should have been eating like somebody who was fueling for performance and energy,” she says. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma467qqc000u3b6dadqojpxi@published" data-word-count="59"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly had been having regular &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/menstruation-full-moon-red-moon-cycle-white-moon-cycle.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;periods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; since she was 13, but when she was 18 and made these lifestyle changes, her period stopped. “I was told by coaches and doctors, ‘Oh, that is just something that happens to active women,’” she says. Years later, when she started thinking about starting a family, the severity of her condition became clear. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma467qux000w3b6dqfwlofzw@published" data-word-count="7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below, Kelly recalls her journey to motherhood.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma460vu600160iggp0pc0y08@published" data-word-count="43"&gt;During my freshman year of college, my parents sat me down for a talk. They were worried that I was exercising too much and had grown too thin. They said, “Will you just go to a doctor and have them run some labs?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma4689uk00173b6df183hg4s@published" data-word-count="61"&gt;So I went to a primary-care doctor and they ran a bunch of labs and they said that everything was normal. My BMI was right at the bottom of the healthy range. And so I said to my parents, “Look, see, I’m fine.” I got even deeper into running at that point — running half-marathons and marathons and doing well in them.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma460vu600180iggue4vsyze@published" data-word-count="33"&gt;I ran in a recreational league in college, and though we didn’t compare notes, I definitely knew a handful of other women who also had lost their periods. That normalized it for me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma468nzd001h3b6dy3rys8nl@published" data-word-count="61"&gt;Plus, I was off and on birth-control pills, depending on if I was in a long-term relationship or not. When I was on the pill, it let me push the questions surrounding my period to the back of my mind, because when you’re on the pill, it masks your natural period. I bled no matter what, because of the synthetic hormones.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma460vu6001a0iggdysm2bwe@published" data-word-count="81"&gt;When I was a sophomore, I started getting a bit suspicious. I had this nagging feeling of, &lt;em&gt;Maybe this isn’t healthy; maybe I should go off the pill and see if I get my period naturally.&lt;/em&gt; I went off the pill and, sure enough, I didn’t get my period. I made an appointment with my gynecologist and said, “I’m a runner. I’m not getting my period. It’s been like this for a long time. Is this bad? What should I do?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma469355001q3b6dqsylqr12@published" data-word-count="52"&gt;And the doctor said, “Look at you! You’re healthy. You love running. You’re not trying to have a baby right now. It’s fine. And when you want to have a baby, you can always come back. We can talk about IVF! But you’re nowhere near there, so I wouldn’t worry about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma469355001r3b6dbuoxcdau@published" data-word-count="82"&gt;I trusted him. He was the doctor who delivered me — this old, lovely guy. I also didn’t question what he said because I was afraid of gaining weight. If he had told me, “Look, this is unhealthy. This is not good. You need to stop this,” I would’ve listened. It would’ve been hard for me, but I would’ve listened to him. But the opposite of that happened. I thought, &lt;em&gt;Well, I was a little worried, but the doctor said it’s fine. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma469356001s3b6d8nd0q8eg@published" data-word-count="54"&gt;So I kept running. At my peak, I was running more than 70 miles a week and eating a little more than I had been in high school. After that doctor’s appointment, I didn’t think about my missing period for a long time. I went back on the pill and I graduated from college.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma469fcb00293b6dqz0jenaz@published" data-word-count="80"&gt;In my late 20s, I switched from the pill to a copper IUD without hormones, one that wouldn’t affect my menstrual cycle. I still didn’t get my period. At that point, I started to feel like I was in menopause. My hair was getting thin and falling out, and I had a huge crash in energy. I just felt weird and horrible and off. Without the pill, I began to feel in my body what it meant not to menstruate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma469l6o002i3b6duy9csgr7@published" data-word-count="33"&gt;By then, I had also fallen in love, and though I wasn’t ready for kids, I could imagine having them fairly soon. That’s when I finally admitted to myself, “This is probably bad.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma469ugq002z3b6dld25u1x2@published" data-word-count="94"&gt;The physician ordered an MRI to see if I had a pituitary tumor — that came back negative. They also conducted a Provera challenge, in which the patient is given a course of synthetic progesterone to see if it will induce menstruation. I failed it. But I still didn’t get any kind of diagnosis. Instead, they told me, “Oh, you have this thing that happens to active women,” and said, “It’s possible that eating a little more could help. You could try cutting back your running a bit and increasing your calories a bit.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46a71j003h3b6d3jj4xfbs@published" data-word-count="42"&gt;Right about then, a book came out called &lt;a href="https://www.noperiodnowwhat.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Period, Now What?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;It was written by Nicola Sykes, who has a Ph.D. in computational biology. She went through this experience herself and realized that there should be better information about it available.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46acut003q3b6d4awaz4vq@published" data-word-count="62"&gt;Reading the book, a lightbulb went off. I had a textbook case of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24431-hypothalamic-amenorrhea"&gt;hypothalamic amenorrhea&lt;/a&gt; (HA) — when the hypothalamus causes your period to stop. That can happen due to low energy availability, excessive exercise, or chronic stress. HA can cause short-term issues like fatigue and mood swings and lead to bigger problems down the road, like bone loss, heart risks, and infertility.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46acut003r3b6d9teuzeup@published" data-word-count="45"&gt;In the book, Sykes wrote that to recover from this, you need to stop &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;intense exercise — anything that gets your heart rate up — and consume at least 2,500 calories a day. If you do those things, then your period will come back.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46ampk00483b6d7ag8qiwp@published" data-word-count="61"&gt;I read the book and my first reaction was like, “I know this is me, but oh my God, you have to stop doing &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; intense exercise? I’m a runner! This gives me so much joy. I’m in all these groups of friends that are runners!” I couldn’t imagine doing that. So I decided, &lt;em&gt;I’ll eat more and I’ll exercise less&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46at9p004h3b6dgpqtygt7@published" data-word-count="129"&gt;I switched to a high-calorie diet with no restrictions whatsoever — I ate lots of pizza, ice cream, pasta. I prioritized high-carb foods and frequent meals throughout the day. Eating more was easier for me to wrap my head around than not exercising. So for a few months, I didn’t change much about my running. But still, no period. So then I ran a little bit less, and a little less and less and less — and I still didn’t get my period. Finally, after about six months of this, another lightbulb went off and I realized,&lt;em&gt; This gradual method is just going to prolong how long it takes me to recover. If I want to get back to running a lot, I have to stop completely for now. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46at9q004i3b6dsfzlx12n@published" data-word-count="66"&gt;So I stopped all exercise. I biked to work — an easy bike ride — and that was it. At first, not running was the hardest thing I’d ever done. It was excruciating. I just felt so antsy all the time, and I really, really wanted to run. If I saw somebody jogging in the street, I’d feel so jealous and sad and conflicted and bad.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46at9q004j3b6dhsaxv39t@published" data-word-count="121"&gt;But then I woke up a week or two into those six weeks and I was like, &lt;em&gt;Oh, wow, I don’t care if I run today or not. I’ll do this as long as it takes.&lt;/em&gt; I soon noticed that life had a lot more ups and downs, and that was a surprise. Sometimes I felt good, and sometimes I felt bad. I realized that for the past decade, it was as if I had been putting a blanket over everything, because running was very effective at making me feel even-keeled. If I did ten miles in the morning, I’d have all these endorphins, and the rest of the day, nothing much bothered. But the thing is, things should bother you.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46b3pe00503b6dpyehrfdm@published" data-word-count="84"&gt;My period came back six weeks after I fully stopped running. I remember discovering that I had my period and thinking, &lt;em&gt;Oh my God, this is amazing. This is beautiful. &lt;/em&gt;It had been ten years since I’d had one. I was so angry that none of the doctors said to me, “Hey, this is a thing that happens to people and we know how to recover from it. This is what you have to do.” Instead, I treated myself after reading a random book.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46bg3p005i3b6dsbb7bife@published" data-word-count="83"&gt;I gained weight during this time, about maybe 10 or 12 pounds — I’m four-foot-ten, so that’s a lot on me. I had to buy new clothes. It was a little difficult, mentally, because I was used to being extremely thin. I was about to get married and I remember when I went to my last dress fitting, they said, “Oh, actually, you’re not as skinny as you were when we first fit this, so we have to take it out a little.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46blg0005r3b6dia1fvv47@published" data-word-count="57"&gt;At first, that made me uncomfortable, but I was so sold on the idea that I was doing the right thing. I knew it was healthy, and I experienced a major shift in my mind-set. I just thought, &lt;em&gt;Yeah, it’s working! They &lt;/em&gt;should &lt;em&gt;take my dress out because I shouldn’t have been the size I was before. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46c0e900683b6davkmv04v@published" data-word-count="70"&gt;After about a year, we decided to try for a baby. I was back to running, but not super competitively at all — I was interested in other things now. I was probably doing around 30 miles per week. I had already been tracking my cycle very closely, because when you have had HA, you’re more prone to losing your period again. So I knew exactly when I was ovulating.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46c7ge006h3b6dm0r9cxum@published" data-word-count="159"&gt;It took me three cycles to get pregnant, and then I miscarried. But that miscarriage was not a heartbreaking experience for me. One day, I thought I got my period, and then my period just didn’t stop. Normally, my periods are maybe four or five days long, and I was on day nine and I was still bleeding, and I thought, &lt;em&gt;What is going on?&lt;/em&gt; I went to my OB/GYN — a new one — and she asked me if I’d taken a pregnancy test. And I said, “No, you don’t understand, I am on day ten of my cycle. I haven’t even ovulated yet.” I was kind of frustrated with her. My experience over the past decade had destroyed my trust in doctors and made me feel like if I wanted good care, I needed to be the one to make sure it happened — I couldn’t blindly trust doctors to be doing the right thing for me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46c7gf006i3b6dm06xu3dj@published" data-word-count="51"&gt;She said, “Okay, that makes sense, that’s fine, but why don’t we just rule it out?” So I went to the bathroom, took the pregnancy test, and it was positive, and I was like, “Oh my God, I’m not on day ten of my cycle. I’m still on the previous cycle!”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46c7gf006j3b6dx6f9loz4@published" data-word-count="55"&gt;We found out it was a nonviable pregnancy, and I had to have a D&amp;amp;C — I think because they were worried it might be ectopic. But because I had never gotten excited over a positive pregnancy test, I just thought, &lt;em&gt;Wow, how cool I can get pregnant! &lt;/em&gt;I didn’t feel too sad at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46c7gf006k3b6drxohim3v@published" data-word-count="18"&gt;Three cycles later, I was pregnant again. And this time, the pregnancy went great. I loved being pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46cgrb00713b6dsbhs5jt4@published" data-word-count="35"&gt;The birth was complicated and bad. My baby was born with the cord wrapped around his neck and he was totally blue: low Apgar score. He had to be in the NICU for a week.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46coq1007a3b6d9pubt7k1@published" data-word-count="65"&gt;They discharged me, and then I came back to the hospital the very next day to be with him in the NICU. I had a friend who was an OB at the hospital. When she came to say hi and see how I was doing, I said, “I feel okay for having just given birth! But I do feel like I’m a little bit swollen.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46coq1007b3b6dnq1q9nrv@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;In fact, I had mentioned to the nurses before I was discharged that I felt like I looked very, very swollen. My hands, my face, my legs, my ankles. I felt uncomfortable, and I didn’t look like myself. But the nurse kind of laughed at me and said, “No, no, I’m more swollen than you! You’re not that swollen. This is what happens postpartum!”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46coq1007c3b6dsoil4y1a@published" data-word-count="37"&gt;I thought, &lt;em&gt;Okay, that’s fine.&lt;/em&gt; But then my OB friend said, “Sure, that can be normal, but since you’re here at the hospital, why don’t you just get your blood pressure taken and make sure everything’s okay?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46coq1007d3b6dl5jvxq39@published" data-word-count="56"&gt;So I walked around the corner to labor and delivery, and I said, “I feel kind of swollen. I just gave birth. Can you guys take my blood pressure?” They were a bit dismissive, and they said, “You don’t look that swollen, and we’re super busy right now. Can you come back in a few hours?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46coq2007e3b6dt6kkpf13@published" data-word-count="71"&gt;When my friend came back to check on me and I told her what happened, she said, “You know what? I’m just going to take your blood pressure myself.” She took my blood pressure, and all these alarms went off. It was like 200 over 100 or something crazy. They checked me in immediately — I had postpartum preeclampsia, and I had to be inpatient for a week. That was horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46coq2007f3b6d9dmrb0kj@published" data-word-count="76"&gt;A lot of people don’t realize that you can get preeclampsia up to six weeks postpartum. It’s even more deadly postpartum because doctors are less likely to catch it. So I was very lucky that I was in the hospital visiting my son in the NICU and that my friend was there. As far as I know, this had nothing to do with my history of HA — preeclampsia is just a thing that can happen.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve heard stories of women with HA who, instead of recovering, do IVF to get pregnant. It’s scary to think that I could have gone through pregnancy in the compromised health state that HA puts you in. And it’s even more scary to think that I could have become a mother in the compromised emotional state that led me to develop HA in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

Becoming a parent, especially in the early days, forces you to put someone else’s needs before your own and give up control. This is a stressful shift even for people who are mentally fit. I can’t imagine doing it from the mind-set I was in when I had HA.&lt;/p&gt;

With both boys, when I was postpartum, I felt myself itching to fall back into my old eating and exercising patterns. I was burning tons and tons of calories through breastfeeding, and I think as a result, I just felt this intense desire to run a lot and not eat enough in a way that was weird and surprising to me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46d63200883b6d61i1rxt1@published" data-word-count="88"&gt;But as soon as I would follow through on these urges a little bit — like, say, &lt;em&gt;Oh, I’m going to go on a long run, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Oh, I’m not going to have a snack &lt;/em&gt;— suddenly I was like, &lt;em&gt;Wow, that’s interesting. I notice that this behavior pattern in my brain is definitely not what I want, so I’ll stop that. &lt;/em&gt;I could feel it starting, but I knew there was no way, with everything that I’ve been through, that I’d let it progress to its end.&lt;/p&gt;

But now that I have two kids and my career, there have been times when I’m running more and times when I’m running less. I’m grateful that I was forced to recover from HA because it made running just one thing among many that I enjoy, and sometimes it takes a backseat, and that’s good.&lt;/p&gt;

Ask whether it’s really in the best interest of the patient.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Dr Johnson acknowledges that 'CT scans are a wonderful technology,' he adds that doctors 'may want to consider potential alternatives.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;CT scans are used to diagnose and monitor cancers and bone injuries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/new-cancer-risk-data-suggest-hitting-pause-routine-ct-scans-2025a10009xo?icd=login_success_email_match_fpf&amp;amp;icd=login_success_email_match_fpf"&gt;video &lt;/a&gt;for Medscape, Dr Johnson said: 'CT scans are a wonderful technology. There’s no doubt of that. However, we may want to consider potential alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We may also want to ask ourselves whether these scans are the best tools we have and ultimately whether they will change patient management.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CT scans, which use ionizing radiation to create detailed images of the body, are not the only imaging tool doctors have at their disposal. They are best used for imaging of bones, soft tissues and organs and are frequently used for detecting tumors, fractures and blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr Johnson noted the FDA has recognized ionizing radiation as a carcinogen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr David Johnson is urging doctors to reevaluate if CT scans are really in their patients' best interests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are similar scans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An x-ray also uses radiation - though a lower dose - to produce images of the body, but those images are less detailed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While CT scans produce 3-dimensional images, x-rays only produce 2-dimensional images. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MRIs use no radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, the machines use magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of soft tissue and organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they are more expensive than CT scans (costing as much as $12,000 per scan) and take longer, which can prove fatal if images are needed right away in an emergency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While an MRI can take between 30 and 60 minutes, a CT scan only takes about 15 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Johnson first raised concerns about CT scans and cancer risk in a 2009 opinion &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrgastro.2009.184"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He wrote: 'Unfortunately, there is little cognizance among health-care providers (or their patients) about the relative latent cancer risks associated with repetitive exposure to ionizing radiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Given the exposure of a relatively high proportion of the population to these tests, it is incumbent on healthcare providers to have an improved understanding of these risks and discuss them accordingly with their patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The risks and benefits of these tests should be carefully analyzed and radiation exposure risk assessment should be conducted as part of the selection of diagnostic and screening tests.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the estimated percent lifetime risk of death from cancer that is attributable to the radiation from a single CT scan of the head&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the estimated percent lifetime risk of death from cancer that is attributable to the radiation from a single CT scan of the abdomen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That same year, researchers estimated high doses of radiation from CT scans were responsible for two percent of all cancers (roughly 30,000) per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, recent &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778?resultClick=1"&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;estimated 'CT-associated cancer could eventually account for five percent of all new cancer diagnoses annually.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, a study by California researchers estimated that, over the lifetime of the millions of people receiving CT scans, about 103,000 radiation-induced cancers from the scans are projected to result from tests done in 2023 alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Johnson said in the video that the findings 'were quite striking.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers warned CT machines emit unsafe levels of radiation that can fuel the formation of tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The highest number of projected cancer cases in adults was linked to CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, followed closely by chest CTs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Across all patients, the most frequently associated cancers were lung, colon, leukemia, and bladder cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among female patients specifically, breast cancer emerged as the second most common type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a professor at the University of California-San Francisco medical school, is one of the authors of the new research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In her new research, the team found the three most common cancers observed in exposed patients were lung cancer - 22,400 cases - colon cancer - 8,700 cases- and leukemia - 7,900 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the number of CT scans performed in millions (right axis and blue lines) and the incidence of cancer per 1,000 CT scans (left axis and black lines)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the projected number of CT-induced cancers by body region exposed to the scan in adults&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Estimated radiation-induced cancer risks were higher in children, despite adults receiving more CTs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Men and women experienced CT-related cancers at about the same rate across all ages and number of scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer risk related to CT exposure was highest in people in the 60s and lowest for children under 10 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Smith-Bindman previously told NBC: 'It’s unfathomable. We keep doing more and more CTs, and the doses keep going up.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said between two machines, one could be exposing patients to 10 to 15 times higher radiation doses than the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'There is very large variation and the doses vary by an order of magnitude — tenfold, not 10 percent different — for patients seen for the same clinical problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Radiation exposure is measured in millisieverts (mSv), which measures the amount of radiation absorbed by the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People are exposed to small amounts of radiation every day from their background environment or through things like flying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, a roundtrip flight between New York and Tokyo exposes a person to 0.19 mSv. An x-ray of the stomach emits 0.6 mSv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2009 study looked at the radiation dose associated with the 11 most common types of CT scans performed on 1,119 adult patients in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the projected number of CT-induced cancers by body region exposed to the scan in kids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Radiation exposure varied widely. Average doses ranged from 2 mSv for a head CT to 31 mSv for an abdominal and pelvic CT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers found the amount of radiation emitted by CT scanners varied widely across the four hospitals they collected data from - with a 13-fold difference between the highest and lowest doses for each scan type. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an attempt to tackle the problem, new Medicare regulations effective this year will require hospitals and imaging centers to collect and share information about the radiation emitted by their scanners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The regulations also require a more careful inspection of the dosing, quality and necessity of CT scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new rules, issued in the final weeks of the Biden administration, are being rolled out over three years in hospitals and outpatient clinics and providers could face fines if they do not comply, beginning in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Trump administration has not commented on its plans to follow, revise or reverse the new policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            Cases of whooping cough are climbing across the country this year, with about 6,600 already documented — nearly four times the number at the same point last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4dixt800003b6m2bigmlu0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2024, there were more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/media/pdfs/2025/01/pertuss-surv-report-2024_PROVISIONAL-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;35,000&lt;/a&gt; cases of whooping cough in the United States, the highest in more than a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/pertussis-cases-by-year.html" target="_blank"&gt;decade&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/media/pdfs/2025/01/pertuss-surv-report-2024_PROVISIONAL-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Ten people died&lt;/a&gt;, including six babies less than 1 year old.

            Given the rise in cases, I wanted to know what causes whooping cough, how it spreads and what the symptoms are. What vaccine is recommended to prevent it, and who should get it? Why do cases appear to be surging? And what should people who are concerned about whooping cough do protect themselves and others?
    &lt;/p&gt;

            To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner.

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What causes whooping cough?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e6086000q3b6mj4274idf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Whooping cough, also called pertussis, is a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;highly contagious respiratory illness&lt;/a&gt; caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. These bacteria are spread from person to person. If someone infected with pertussis coughs or sneezes, tiny droplets are released that contain the bacteria. People nearby can become infected by breathing in the droplets. The bacteria can also be spread through prolonged close contact when people share the same breathing space — for instance, when infected people &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/whooping-cough/symptoms-causes/syc-20378973" target="_blank"&gt;hold a baby&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What are the symptoms?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e6086000s3b6mz4rks8sx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/pertussis#tab=tab_1" target="_blank"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; generally start seven to 10 days following infection. Initially, an infected person develops symptoms similar to a cold and other mild respiratory infections, such as a low-grade fever, runny nose and cough. The cough often then progresses to a severe hacking cough that is characterized by &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;violent coughing fits&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e6086000t3b6m51au6b57@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During these coughing fits, people may make a high-pitched “whoop” when they try to take breaths after they cough, hence the name whooping cough. The fits may be so severe that they vomit during or afterward. Many struggle to sleep as a result. Some may have trouble breathing, and patients have been known to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/health/whooping-cough-cases-surging-human-challenge/index.html"&gt;break their ribs&lt;/a&gt; due to the severity of the force associated with coughing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e6086000u3b6mgaiasbw7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pertussis is especially dangerous in infants. Globally, it is a significant cause of disease and death in infancy, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/pertussis#tab=tab_1" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. About 1 in 3 babies younger than 1 year old infected with pertussis will need care in the hospital, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC statistics&lt;/a&gt; also indicate that about 1 in 5 of those hospitalized develop pneumonia, 1 in 50 have convulsions, and about 1 in 100 will die from their complications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e6086000v3b6mpcxjwmyi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, there are people with preexisting health conditions that may be exacerbated by pertussis. These &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/postexposure-prophylaxis/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;include&lt;/a&gt; those who are immunocompromised or have moderate to severe asthma.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How long does recovery take? Can anything speed it up?&lt;/strong&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Length of time to recover depends on the individual. Coughing fits typically last between &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;one and six weeks&lt;/a&gt;, but they can persist for as long as 10 weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e6086000y3b6m5q9b68kd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The treatment for pertussis is antibiotics. There are a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/clinical-care/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;common antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; that are effective against pertussis, including azithromycin, clarithromycin and erythromycin. The earlier the treatment begins, the better the prognosis. Early treatment has been shown to reduce severity and the time to recover.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e6086000z3b6mpod3jtty@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; In some patients, the diagnosis can be made simply by hearing the characteristic cough. Others who are a bit more subtle will &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/pertussis/symptoms-diagnosis" target="_blank"&gt;require testing&lt;/a&gt; via a nose and throat swab.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            People infected with pertussis can spread the bacteria from the time their symptoms start until at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;two weeks&lt;/a&gt; after coughing begins. Many cases of pertussis may be spread by people who think they have a run-of-the-mill virus before their severe coughing fits begin. Early use of antibiotics can shorten the time someone is contagious.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What vaccine is recommended to prevent it? At what ages should it be given?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e608600133b6mizgsh19u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; There are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;two types&lt;/a&gt; of combination vaccines that include protection against pertussis, the DTaP vaccine and Tdap. These vaccinations include protection against tetanus (the “T” in each name) and diphtheria (the “D” and “d” in those names).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e608600143b6mg85cjyry@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/dtap-tdap-td/hcp/administering-vaccine.html" target="_blank"&gt;DTaP&lt;/a&gt; series is five doses of the vaccine given at 2 months, 4 months and 6 months old, then 15 months through 18 months old, then 4 years through 6 years old, according to the CDC’s recommended immunization schedule. Tdap is then recommended for all adolescents, with the preferred age of administration being 11 to 12 years old.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e608600153b6m2iowjobs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Adults who never received Tdap should receive a single dose. To maintain protection, all adults should also receive a booster &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/health/whooping-cough-cases-surging-human-challenge/index.html"&gt;every 10 years&lt;/a&gt;. And pregnant women are recommended one dose of Tdap during a pregnancy to be given during gestational weeks 27 through 36 to convey some antibodies to their baby. Getting the vaccines &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/dtap-tdap-td/hcp/about-vaccine.html" target="_blank"&gt;reduces&lt;/a&gt; the likelihood of contracting pertussis as well as the severity of the disease if one were to get it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e608600163b6mi3wc09n3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Why are pertussis cases increasing?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e608600173b6m7924c5s4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The exact cause is not known, though there are some hypotheses. One is related to the Covid-19 pandemic: More people were wearing masks, isolating and taking precautions that reduced transmission of all respiratory illnesses. As a result, there were fewer pertussis cases then, with a rebound once these precautions stopped. Moreover, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7338a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; for DTaP along with other childhood immunizations have been declining. This is an unfortunate development. People should be reminded that during the early part of the 20th century, before widespread availability of the pertussis vaccine, pertussis was a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;major cause&lt;/a&gt; of childhood mortality in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e608600183b6mpzomhzd3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Completing the DTaP series is important, as is receiving the Tdap vaccine for those who are eligible. Individuals with symptoms of pertussis should get tested so that they can know if they have pertussis and prevent spread to others.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e5y6y000o3b6m5v12st0g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People should also know that the likelihood of spread within a household is high. In addition to good handwashing and the limiting of contact with infected people, the CDC recommends that everyone who shares a household with someone who has pertussis, even if they don’t have symptoms, should get antibiotics within 21 days of the beginning of the cough in that initial person.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e6zhq001c3b6mpu9hy9dc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This method of receiving antibiotics after exposure, known as post-exposure prophylaxis, can help reduce their chance of contracting pertussis. In addition, the CDC supports providing antibiotics to people at high risk of severe infection within 21 days of exposure to someone who has pertussis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the National Institutes for Health (NIH) today announced the development of the next-generation, universal vaccine platform, Generation Gold Standard, using a beta-propiolactone (BPL)-inactivated, whole-virus platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This initiative represents a decisive shift toward transparency, effectiveness, and comprehensive preparedness, funding the NIH’s in-house development of universal influenza and coronavirus vaccines, including candidates BPL-1357 and BPL-24910. These vaccines aim to provide broad-spectrum protection against multiple strains of pandemic-prone viruses such as H5N1 avian influenza and coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our commitment is clear: every innovation in vaccine development must be grounded in gold standard science and transparency, and subjected to the highest standards of safety and efficacy testing,” said HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program realigns BARDA’s operations with its statutory mission under the Public Health Service Act—to prepare for all influenza viral threats, not just those currently circulating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Generation Gold Standard is a paradigm shift,” said NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. “It extends vaccine protection beyond strain-specific limits and prepares for flu viral threats – not just today’s, but tomorrow’s as well – using traditional vaccine technology brought into the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generation Gold Standard, developed exclusively by NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="spaced"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recalibrates America’s pandemic preparedness&lt;/strong&gt;. Unlike traditional vaccines that target specific strains, BPL-inactivated whole-virus vaccines preserve the virus’s structural integrity while eliminating infectivity. This approach induces robust B and T cell immune responses and offers long-lasting protection across diverse viral families. Moreover, the intranasal formulation of BPL-1357 is currently in Phase Ib and II/III trials and is designed to block virus transmission—an innovation absent from current flu and COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embodies efficient, transparent, and government-led research&lt;/strong&gt;. The BPL platform is fully government-owned and NIH-developed. This approach ensures radical transparency, public accountability, and freedom from commercial conflicts of interest.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marks the future of vaccine development&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition to influenza and coronavirus, the BPL platform is adaptable for future use against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza. It also offers the unprecedented capability to protect against avian influenza without inducing antigenic drift—a major step forward in proactive pandemic prevention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials for universal influenza vaccines are scheduled to begin in 2026, with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval targeted for 2029. The intranasal BPL-1357 flu vaccine, currently in advanced trials, is also on track for FDA review by 2029.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the National Institutes of Health (NIH):&lt;/strong&gt;
NIH, the nation's medical research agency, includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic, clinical, and translational medical research, and is investigating the causes, treatments, and cures for both common and rare diseases.

Older or damaged cells put people at higher risk of cognitive decline and chronic diseases such as &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-6218db20-25e5-11f0-b65d-e37d95cf0d09"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While you can't control your chronological age, eating a Mediterranean diet, being physically active, reducing stress, and eating well can help maintain a lower biological age or turn the clock back further.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analyzing around 14 years' worth of health data from more than 280,000 people in the UK, average age of 57 the researchers found those who developed dementia were biologically older (55 vs. 45) at baseline, according to blood and organ function biomarkers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with the most advanced biological age were about 30 percent more likely to develop dementia than those in the lowest group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the researchers relied on advanced algorithms to calculate people’s biological ages, DailyMail.com has revealed a 24-question quiz that will reveal how old your body really is - despite how many years you've been alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists say that simple tweaks to diet, exercise, and sleep can help reduce a person's biological age, or how old their body's cells and tissues are&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say a good result is a biological age that is slightly younger than the chronological age, or the number of years someone has been alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Longevity experts at NOVOS based in New York City, have made an AI-powered tool that estimates one's biological age without using blood test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The test is free, involves no needles, and is based on results from 47,000 Americans and Europeans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People taking the test first answer questions on their ethnicity, gender, education level, and income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The test also asks users for their arm circumference, which can point to muscle mass and fat distribution. If this is not known, users are told they can input the US average of 13 inches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is also a question on blood pressure where participants used data from the American Heart Association to estimate their blood pressure in cases where they do not know their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A healthy range is 120/80 mmHg, while an unhealthy range is 120 to 129 mmHg and less than 80 mmHg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are asked about lifestyle, including weight gain in recent years, their alcohol consumption, and if they get out of breath walking up stairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The tool then analyzes the data to reveal a biological age, which is sent to users via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The online calculator is just an estimate as it takes extensive testing to determine a person's biological age.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study by Chinese researchers, the team determined &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13992279/ability-balance-one-leg-old-bones-biological-age.html"&gt;people’s biological ages&lt;/a&gt; by measuring lung function, blood pressure, and cholesterol, as well as other blood biomarkers, including average cell volume and white blood cell count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average chronological age at the study's start was about 57 while the average biological age was around 45. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When dividing the participants into four groups based on biological age, researchers found those with the most advanced biological age were about 30 percent more likely to develop dementia than those in the lowest group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with a higher biological age tended to be older, male, current or former smokers, and carriers of the APOE 4 gene, which is linked to a higher likelihood of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brain scans reveal how accelerated biological aging shrinks critical brain structures, specifically gray matter volume (GMV). Faster aging (measured by KDM-BA and PhenoAge) correlates with reduced gray matter volume in memory and cognitive regions (A-D) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers employed two different algorithms to calculate individuals' biological ages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One, called KDM-BA, uses a machine-learning model that compares nine health measurements in a person - such as blood pressure, cholesterol, and lung function - to population averages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If biomarkers are worse than expected for their chronological age, they receive an older biological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other algorithm, PhenoAge, estimates biological age using 10 measurements - including inflammation and metabolic markers such as glucose - combined with chronological age in a mortality-predicting formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Higher biological age scores calculated by both were tied to smaller volume in the vast majority of people’s brain regions, especially in the hippocampus, where memories are processed and stored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Individuals with a higher biological age as determined by the KDM-BA algorithm, exhibited a thinner cortex, or the brain’s outer layer, in 40 brain regions, particularly those involved in memory and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Individuals with a higher biological age as determined by the PhenoAge algorithm, exhibit cortex thinning across 45 brain areas, with the most significant shrinkage occurring in regions responsible for sensory processing and emotion regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the journal Neurology, found 36 to 40 regions of the brain that showed thinning were also associated with an increased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bryan's biohacking and restrictive diet have transformed his appearance, shown in 2018 (left) and 2023 (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This cortical thinning accounted for approximately eight percent of the heightened risk associated with accelerated biological aging, indicating it plays a significant – but not exclusive – role in cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While thinning brain tissue contributes to dementia risk, other aging-related factors (like vascular damage or protein buildup) likely drive the majority of the danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the people who later developed dementia had an average chronological age of 65 at the start of the study, compared to 57 for those who stayed free of dementia, their average biological age was 55 by one of the methods, compared to 45 for those with no dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Yacong Bo, a researcher at Zhengzhou University in China, said: ‘These brain structure changes explain some, but not all, of the association between advanced biological age and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘These results support the hypothesis that advanced biological age may contribute to the development of dementia by causing a widespread change in brain structures.’&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in good news for those seeking to turn back the hands of time, reducing stress can lower your biological age by just a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists also argue that simple tweaks to diet, exercise, and sleep can help reduce a person's biological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And biohacking in the quest for longevity has surged in popularity in recent years, with followers trying to reduce their biological age to live longer and avoid illnesses such as heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Famous biohacker Bryan Johnson, 47, claims the biological age of his lungs is 18. He also claims to have the heart of a 37-year-old, the skin of a 28-year-old, the gum inflammation of a 17-year-old, and the nighttime erection rate of a teenager.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Bo said: ‘With the rising impact of dementia around the world, identifying risk factors and implementing preventive measures is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘While none of us can change our chronological age, we can influence our biological age through lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 01

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s his goal to even further lessen trust in vaccines and make it onerous enough for manufacturers that they will abandon it,” said Dr Paul Offit, an expert on infectious disease and immunology and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, about the statements and Kennedy. “It’s a fragile market.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In this same week, Kennedy extolled parents to “do their own research” in a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/kennedy-vaccines-research.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;talk show interview&lt;/a&gt; – the phrase has become pop culture shorthand for a shallow internet search that casts people into the arms of the disinformation

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“All new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure – a radical departure from past practices,” an HHS spokesperson told the Washington Post, in response to questions about general vaccine policy and the measles vaccine. The department did not clarify what it meant by “new vaccine”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The department spokesperson also described new surveillance systems for vaccines, “that will accurately measure vaccine risks as well as benefits – because real science demands both transparency and accountability”, but did not elaborate on the design of those systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prior to being confirmed to the role of health secretary, Kennedy was arguably the nation’s most prominent anti-vaccine advocate and led a non-profit known for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/13/majority-antivaxx-vaccine-ads-facebook-funded-by-two-organizations-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;prolific misinformation&lt;/a&gt;. He also &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/us/rfk-jr-finances.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;earned money&lt;/a&gt; by referring clients to law firms suing vaccine makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Among the claims Kennedy spread was that medications cause “autoimmune injuries and allergic injuries and neurodevelopmental injuries that have long diagnostic horizons or long incubation periods, so you can do the study and you will not see the injury for five years”, he said in an interview in 2021, according to reporting by the Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy also claimed this week that the MMR vaccine includes “aborted fetus debris”. The rubella vaccine, like many vaccines, is produced using &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/fetal-tissues" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;decades-old sterile fetal cell lines&lt;/a&gt; derived from two elective terminations in the 1960s, including the rubella vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Vaccines against new pathogens, such as Covid-19, are placebo tested. However, experts consider new placebo-controlled trials for long-time vaccines, for instance measles, to be unethical because it would effectively deny a patient a known intervention while potentially exposing them to a dangerous disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“No institutional review board at any academic center would ever accept that – so he’s asking what personal injury lawyer invariably asks for, which is the impossible to be done,” said Offit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although Kennedy has made false and misleading statements about vaccines generally, the Covid-19 vaccine appears to be especially in the administration’s crosshairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In response to recent &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/26/rfk-jr-chronic-disease-covid" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;questions about Covid-19 strategy&lt;/a&gt; from the Guardian, the administration responded: “The Covid-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Health officials have reportedly required all research grant applications on messenger RNA technology, which powers most Covid-19 vaccines, be &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/trump-vaccine-skeptics-research-funding" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;flagged to Kennedy’s office&lt;/a&gt;. They have also ended research that tested for the Covid-19 vaccine’s safety and efficacy in special groups, such as pregnant women, as part of an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/rfk-hhs-layoffs-lawsuit" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$11bn clawback&lt;/a&gt; in grants from states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Most controversially, the Food and Drug Administration has delayed expected approval of a new Covid-19 vaccine from Novavax, reportedly on the review of a political appointee known to be skeptical of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Over the weekend, FDA commissioner Marty Makary addressed the delay by describing annual updates to the vaccine’s strains as a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/27/fda-covid-vaccine-approval-process-novavax-pfizer-moderna/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“new” product&lt;/a&gt;, creating confusion about whether vaccine makers have to conduct new safety and efficacy trials.

            When it comes to karma, most people believe the universe is their own personal cheerleader — but an exacting judge for everyone else, according to a new study published May 1 by the &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/rel-rel0000565.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;American Psychological Association&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Psychology of Religion and Spirituality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6w00023j6npdqjy3qg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers asked more than 2,000 people from various &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/23/health/francis-collins-faith-science-public-health-wellness/index.html"&gt;religious&lt;/a&gt; and nonreligious backgrounds to write about their experiences with karma — the belief that good deeds are rewarded, and bad actions are punished — and a common through-line of their responses emerged.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6w00033j6n6bwa318q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the participants wrote about themselves, 59% told tales of being rewarded for their good deeds. In their stories about others, 92% chronicled how misfortune befell cheating partners, indebted friends, bullies and lousy coworkers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6w00043j6n2n0d7pfv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Thinking about karma allows people to take personal credit and feel pride in good things that happen to them even when it isn’t clear exactly what they did to create the good outcome,” the study’s senior author, Cindel White, said in a statement. “But it also allows people to see other people’s suffering as justified retribution.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6w00053j6ni5ppszpe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The findings offer a window into the way our minds form judgments about ourselves and those around us, said White, an assistant professor at York University in Toronto who studies how psychological motives interact with spirituality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6w00063j6ne6k5st9s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I firmly believe in providing charitable donations to those in need, no matter how small,” one anonymous response from the study reads. “Doing so has benefited me greatly and occasionally has led to individuals doing me favors without asking.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6w00073j6ndp1frl71@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another reads, “I knew a guy who was always rude and cruel to everyone; he never did anything nice his entire life. He was diagnosed with cancer, and I just couldn’t help but think that was karma.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x00083j6nes8lpjpl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study identifies the tendency to see yourself as deserving of good fortune, even in the absence of direct causes, as a form of “attribution bias,” — a concept which has been studied by psychologists for decades, said Patrick Heck, a research psychologist at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, commenting in his personal capacity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x00093j6nawcwukih@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Attribution theory and attribution biases are the general idea that people attribute certain things that happen to them or other people in line with ways that make them feel good about themselves,” said Heck, who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000a3j6ncwtktlap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In some ways, attribution bias serves the purpose of promoting self-esteem, which helps people overcome challenges in life, White said. But other times, it could lead people astray when they fail to recognize the contributions of others or the external factors of success.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000b3j6nzuvul9o3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On the other side of the coin, the belief that other people’s suffering is a form of punishment comes from a need to believe that the world is just. This belief can help people make sense of the complexity of life, Heck said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000c3j6ne2tzclw3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “(The world) is full of statistical noise. Random things happen to people all the time. And we know from lots of research in psychology that people struggle to reconcile randomness in their lives,” Heck said. “It’s very compelling to want to have a story or an explanation for why good things happen to some people and why bad things happen to other people. … I think karma is a really nicely packaged way that maybe has found its way into religion and other belief systems.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000d3j6n4mas26ta@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The concept of karma originates from Asian religious traditions such as Hinduism and Buddhism, and many variations exist in how it’s practiced between different groups, White said. For this reason, the study sampled participants from the United States, Singapore and India to get a broad range of cultural and religious backgrounds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000e3j6nxs6p3ygt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Notably, results skewed slightly differently between Western and non-Western respondents, with Indian and Singaporean participants showing less self-enhancing bias — a finding that is consistent with &lt;a href="https://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/Manuscripts/WhiteNorenzayanSchaller-PSPB%202018.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000f3j6nbqiz35hw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We found very similar patterns across multiple cultural contexts, including Western samples, where we know people often think about themselves in exaggeratedly positive ways, and samples from Asian countries where people are more likely to be self-critical,” White said. “But across all countries, participants were much more likely to say that other people face karmic punishments while they receive karmic rewards.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000g3j6n2cialb2d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            White said her future research will explore how these beliefs around karma affect decision-making.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000h3j6nd3ihk242@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s sometimes differences between your religious beliefs, what people actually think about in everyday life, and then how they act,” White said. “There could be other situations where they are prompted by the experience itself, and they’re going to think about karma in a very different way.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000i3j6nrxshljs1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, belief-driven biases can have broad, real-world implications, especially when it comes to policymaking and our justice system, Heck said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000j3j6nlf56pj3r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Often, social prejudices such as racism and classism function on the premise that an “inferior” group earned its status by behaving in a way that is socially unacceptable, said Yudit Jung, an adjunct associate professor of psychology at Emory University in Atlanta who was not involved in the research. Such views can then inform people’s treatment of those groups and their willingness to offer help.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000k3j6nb1kemc0d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ultimately, Jung, who is also a practicing psychoanalyst, said she believes the studied biases are common to most people. They can be a form of defense, originating from early childhood experiences and the need to feel secure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000l3j6n028q39fb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I work with patients a lot on (developing) compassion and a sense of shared humanity, recognizing that we are all a mixture of good and bad,” Jung said. “It’s not about influencing religion. It’s about a patient’s basic ethics.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

ROACH: Since starting blood thinners, I’m unable to continue anti-inflammatories for ongoing arthritis pain. Is there a safe arthritis pain medication other than Tylenol? I am a 72-year-old male on meds for atrial fibrillation, Type 2 diabetes, cholesterol, and a hiatal hernia. Would the maximum daily amount of Tylenol to minimize the pain be too high over an extended period of time? -- L.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="J42SYGY5AZABLD57N6JUM7QW5U"&gt;ANSWER: People taking anticoagulant drugs like warfarin, or one of the newer direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOAC) like apixaban, are at a significantly increased risk of bleeding when they also take anti-inflammatory drugs like naproxen or ibuprofen. Most patients are recommended against using these drugs together. Sometimes after a careful discussion of the risks and benefits, a person on an anticoagulant will be prescribed an anti-inflammatory, but most of the time, they are avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3Y7CF2DJGZCIHKK7V5YPE52NFI"&gt;Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is much safer to use in combination with a DOAC. The maximum dose of Tylenol I recommend in older patients is 3,000 mg, or two extra-strength pills three times daily. I do not recommend this high a dose in some situations, such as an older person with liver disease who is very small in size (120 pounds or less) or who drinks moderate amounts of alcohol. However, adding Tylenol to warfarin (but not a DOAC) can cause the bleeding risk to go up when using a relatively high dose of Tylenol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MUS2BFQPCFG7JJYOXT5ZJALLRY"&gt;One option is an anti-inflammatory gel like diclofenac, which isn’t absorbed as well into the body, so they don’t put a person at risk. But it can penetrate superficial joints like the hands and knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: I’m a female who is 63 years old. My blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg. I’m 98 pounds, and my heart doctor believes that I might be one of those people who produces cholesterol. My total cholesterol is 241 mg/dL, my LDL is 168 mg/dL, and my HDL is 65 mg/dL. My doctor did a calcium score, and the result was 31. Should I take cholesterol meds? -- W.P.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DY3L5CBY4ZE2LJK6CSO5IPQBQE"&gt;ANSWER: There are several decision tools to help doctors and patients evaluate the potential benefits of cholesterol medication, and they start with estimating your risk of having a heart attack or stroke during the next 10 years. Since you have had a coronary calcium scan, the most appropriate tool to use is the MESA score (tinyurl.com/mesascore).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Y5UK5XY2EFDEFN54NAIMXWWDJM"&gt;When I put in your information, it gave a 10-year risk of 3.5%. This is a level at which giving a medication like a statin would only have a minuscule benefit for you, and statins always have a small risk of causing side effects (such as muscle pain). It can also cause blood sugar levels to go up slightly. Experts do not recommend treatment for you at this level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7GLGBKFVCRGJ5IZECQMYAJXZKI"&gt;All humans make cholesterol. Statin drugs work by preventing our body from making as much cholesterol as we otherwise would by blocking an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase. A drug in a different class called ezetimibe works by reducing the amount of cholesterol you can absorb from food. The two together are more effective at lowering cholesterol than either alone, but I do not recommend any medication for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BNVOADI6KNBHDG3XCBWPHCKOQY"&gt;Having a healthy, mostly plant diet (like a Mediterranean-style diet), along with regular exercise, would have a much bigger impact on keeping you healthier than a statin, since a good diet and exercise reduces many health risks, including cancer and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NPEUKDHL6JGKFPCJEMJSW2QXWY"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human beings exhibit marked differences in habits, lifestyles and behavioral tendencies. One of these differences, known as chronotype, is the inclination to sleep and wake up early or alternatively to sleep and wake up late.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Changes in society, such as the introduction of portable devices and video streaming services, may have also influenced people's behavioral patterns, offering them further distractions that could occupy their evenings or late nights. Yet past studies have found that sleeping and waking up late is often linked to a higher risk of being diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mental+health+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mental health disorders&lt;/a&gt;, such as depression and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/anxiety+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;anxiety disorders&lt;/a&gt;, as well as poorer physical health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of humans' chronotypes, as well as the possible implications of being a so-called "morning person" or "night owl," could thus be beneficial. Specifically, it could inform the development of lifestyle interventions or &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medical+treatments/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medical treatments&lt;/a&gt; designed to promote healthy sleeping patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at McGill University, the Mila–Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute and other institutes recently carried out a study exploring the neurobiological underpinnings of people's natural tendency to be more active at specific times of the day. Their findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02182-w" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/i&gt;, unveil associations between chronotype and specific trends in the structure of the brain, as well as reward processing and the regulation of emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"As an explicit manifestation of circadian rhythms, chronotype is closely intertwined with physical and mental health," Le Zhou, Karin Saltoun and their colleagues wrote in their paper. "Night owls often exhibit unhealthier lifestyle habits, are more susceptible to mood disorders and have poorer physical fitness compared with early risers. Although &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/individual+differences/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;individual differences&lt;/a&gt; in chronotype yield varying consequences, their neurobiological underpinnings remain elusive."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary objective of this recent study by Zhou, Saltoun and their colleagues was to explore the link between chronotype and various phenotypes (i.e., characteristics or traits arising from the interaction between a person's genes and their environment). In addition, it was aimed at determining whether the brains of morning people and night owls exhibit some differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To work toward these goals, the researchers analyzed data from one of the largest biomedical databases compiled to date, the UK Biobank. Their analyses focused on the chronotype of included individuals, as well as imaging scans capturing their brains and various phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We conducted a pattern-learning analysis with three brain-imaging modalities (gray matter volume, white-matter integrity and functional connectivity) and capitalized on 976 phenotypes in 27,030 UK Biobank participants," wrote the researchers. "The resulting multilevel analysis reveals convergence on the basal ganglia, limbic system, hippocampus and cerebellum. The pattern derived from modeling actigraphy wearables data of daily movement further highlighted these key brain features."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, this study is one of the most comprehensive explorations of the neurobiology of chronotypes carried out to date. The findings it gathered suggest that chronotype is deeply rooted in the biology of the brain, while also confirming its connections with people's unique traits, learning, emotional regulation and behavioral patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recent work could soon inform future research aimed at further exploring the neurobiological differences between morning people and night owls. Eventually, it could also contribute to the development of targeted interventions to treat mental health conditions or improve people's lifestyle, which also account for chronotype-related factors.&lt;/p&gt;

Red meat comes from non-fowl mammals (a.k.a. animals that aren’t birds). Beef, pork, lamb, venison, and boar are examples of red meat. Chicken and turkey, on the other hand, are white meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, red meat &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7015455/#:~:text=Red%20meat%20is%20a%20nutrient%20dense%20food%20that%20is%20an,B12%20in%20the%20diet." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:contains key nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;contains key nutrients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like protein, vitamin B12, and zinc. Its major flex? Red meat is a top source of heme iron—the kind most readily absorbed by your body, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/before-during-after/iron-blood-donation/iron-rich-foods.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Red Cross;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Red Cross&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—though you can also find heme iron in chicken and turkey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But be warned: With the buzz around protein online, the pros of red meat might be getting overstated, especially at the expense of the cons.

Here’s a breakdown of the pros and cons of red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It can help keep you full.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some content creators swear by red meat for its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40steakandbuttergal%2Fvideo%2F7482085354737028395&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa64637530%2Fis-red-meat-good-for-you%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:satiating power;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;satiating power&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the science backs that up. Red meat is loaded with protein that keeps hunger at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Protein naturally boosts satiety,” says Kim Johnson, RD, the founder of Nourish/d Wellness. “It keeps you fuller, longer.” That’s partly because it takes more time and energy for your body to break it down, she says. (BTW, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a19993913/protein-breakfast-ideas/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein in general has this effect;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;protein &lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;in general&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;u&gt; has this effect&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so white meat options like chicken should also keep you feeling satiated.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For that reason, Johnson recommends enjoying red meat earlier in the day, ideally a couple of hours before bed, to give your body time to digest. But here’s the kicker: it’s not just the meat that keeps you full—it’s eating adequate calories that helps you feel truly satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It supports muscle growth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to build strength and support lean muscle, red meat might just deserve a spot on your plate. It’s a complete protein source, meaning it packs all nine essential amino acids your body needs for muscle repair and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, it contains &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64174301/how-much-creatine-should-i-take/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:creatine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;creatine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—which has &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a44716483/creatine-for-women/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:legit benefits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;legit benefits&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to strength and performance—along with B vitamins that help convert food into energy and keep your muscles functioning at their best. You’ll also get a healthy dose of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g19967379/signs-youre-not-getting-zinc/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:zinc;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;zinc&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a key player in muscle recovery and overall health, per a 2020 study in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213231720301312" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Redox Biology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Redox Biology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And, you’ll get some iron, which supports muscle growth and function, per a 2023 study in the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jcsm.13277" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia, and Muscle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia, and Muscle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s the most bioavailable source of heme iron.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some women intentionally include red meat &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40catherineirvin%3Fis_from_webapp%3D1%26sender_device%3Dpc&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa64637530%2Fis-red-meat-good-for-you%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:during their follicular phase;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;during their follicular phase&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to help replenish iron levels—and there might be something behind the strategy. Red meat is a top-tier source of iron, a nutrient many &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62514296/weird-signs-of-iron-deficiency/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:women tend to fall short on;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;women tend to fall short on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, especially during menstruation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, it’s not just iron. Red meat is rich in zinc and B vitamins, all of which are essential for hormone health and energy, according to Johnson. “If you find yourself seriously craving meat, it might be your body’s way of signaling a need for more iron, protein, or zinc,” says Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no science specifically citing red meat consumption to be beneficial during a woman’s cycle, however, and you can also get these nutrients from other sources like poultry, seafood, shellfish, and plant-based options, says Anjali Prasertong, MPH, RD, the writer of the weekly newsletter Antiracist Dietitian. And it’s not like red meat is the end all be all of a healthy period. “Hormonal health is best supported by consistent and sustainable nutritional variety, stress management, and avoiding restrictive eating,” says Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s tasty.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in case you wondered, yes! That’s a good enough reason to add it to your plate. There's no point in eating in a way that's “unsustainable and virtually joyless,” says Abby Langer, RD, the founder of Abby Langer Nutrition and author of &lt;em&gt;Good Food, Bad Diet&lt;/em&gt;. So, if you want to eat red meat because it’s tasty—there’s benefit in that too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And now, some of the potential risks of red meat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It may increase your risk of heart disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest cons of eating red meat is its potential to harm &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64343593/dhrps-heart-health-measurement-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;. Processed and non-processed red meat consumption is associated with an increased risk of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64619518/walking-activity-quick-bursts-heart-disease-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; in both men and women, according to a 2023 systematic review in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/44/28/2626/7188739" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:European Heart Journal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;European Heart Journal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because the high saturated fat content in red meat can cause cholesterol levels to rise, says Johnson. Compared to white meat, red meat usually has more saturated fat—and processed meats have even more than unprocessed cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/saturated-fats" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Heart Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recommends that just six percent of your total daily calories come from saturated fat. That means if you’re consuming 2,000 calories, only 120 of them should be from saturated fats, which shakes out to about 13 grams. Particularly as it pertains to diets that are heavy on red meat, it could take a toll on your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64232705/sharell-weeams-heart-attack-essay/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;, Johnson says. “Over time, your risk of cardiovascular disease increases, your LDL cholesterol is very likely to increase, as well as blood pressure and inflammation,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s linked with certain types of cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating more than 12 to 18 ounces of red meat per week has also been linked to a higher chance of getting colorectal cancer, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.aicr.org/cancer-prevention/recommendations/limit-consumption-of-red-and-processed-meat/#what-the-science-says" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Institute for Cancer Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Institute for Cancer Research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (AICR), especially when done at the expense of eating whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and beans. Red meat and processed meat increase colorectal cancer risk by 30 and 40 percent, respectively, according to a 2024 study in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38112776/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers, and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers, and Prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are still trying to learn more about how exactly red and processed meats are linked with cancer, but the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(15)00444-1/abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:classifies processed meat as a Group 1 carcinogen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;classifies processed meat as a Group 1 carcinogen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (the highest level), meaning there is sufficient evidence that it causes cancer in humans. Red meat is group 2, which makes it a probable carcinogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, it’s not just &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a36366953/color-cancer-symptoms-women/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:colon cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;.

Additionally, several large &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8118195/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIH studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;NIH studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have also demonstrated an association between the consumption of heme iron and the development of colorectal cancer and breast cancer in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s linked to type-2 diabetes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red meat, especially the processed kind (think: hot dogs and deli meats), has been linked to a higher risk of type-2 &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a60525665/type-2-diabetes-food-list/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, per a 2024 meta-analysis in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(24)00179-7/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Lancet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Lancet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The number is steep, according to the research. Participants in a 2023 study in the &lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(23)66119-2/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Journal of Clinical Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who consumed the most red and processed meat had a 64 percent higher risk of developing type-2 diabetes compared to those who ate the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side: swapping red meat for more plant-based foods—like beans, nuts, and whole grains—can lower the risk of both heart disease and diabetes, according to a 2023 review in &lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-03093-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BMC Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between red meat and type-2 diabetes comes down to three factors, based on the studies above: saturated fat, heme iron, and inflammatory compounds—all of which can mess with the way your body uses insulin and even damage the cells to produce it, which can lead to type-2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed red meats may increase dementia risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red meat might also mess with your brain health. Eating processed red meats like bacon, sausages, and salami increases dementia risk by 13 percent, according to a 2025 study in &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000210286" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Neurology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Neurology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Just one fourth of a serving per day increased the risk, compared to those who ate processed meat less frequently. One serving of unprocessed red meat also saw a 16 percent increased risk of self-reported cognitive decline, per the same study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, how much red meat should we be eating?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are risks associated with red meat, you don’t need to avoid that section of the grocery store entirely. “We don't have to just completely give up red meat,” says Johnson. “It’s all about what kind, how much, and how often.” Red meat can fit into a balanced diet, she says, and she recommends eating red meat once or twice a week in three to four ounce portions (even less frequently than the &lt;a href="https://www.aicr.org/cancer-prevention/recommendations/limit-consumption-of-red-and-processed-meat/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:AIRC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AIRC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which suggests women cap their red meat consumption at 12 to 18 cooked ounces per week) and minimizing processed meats as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, the claims and diets promoting more frequent consumption might not be backed by experts or science. “I wouldn't recommend it every day,” says Langer. “But once or twice a week, in a moderate amount, is fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just that people online are advocating consuming more red meat, it’s also that they’re eating mostly—or only—red meat. “I'm not against red meat, I’m just against a diet being predominantly one food group,” Langer says. “A variety of food means that we're getting a variety of nutrients.” When it comes to all-meat diets, you're losing out on a lot of the protective nutrients, like high fiber carbs, non-starchy vegetables, antioxidants, and micronutrients, Johnson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blanket statements from red-meat promoters online like “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40steakandbuttergal%2Fvideo%2F7484372490421046574%3F_r%3D1%26_t%3DZT-8vlFPWZF5RL&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa64637530%2Fis-red-meat-good-for-you%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I thrive without fiber;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;I thrive without fiber&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” or “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40catherineirvin%2Fvideo%2F7494016997382950175&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa64637530%2Fis-red-meat-good-for-you%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I'm a daily ground beef girl;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;I'm a daily ground beef girl&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” may work for social media, but maybe not so much for people's real lives, Prasertong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Find The Healthiest Red Meat Options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all red meat is created equal. Processed meats carry some of the highest risks (according to the research above), and you’ll also want to put some consideration into the fat content of your red meat and how it was raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to enjoy beef, try choosing lean cuts like sirloin or tenderloin to avoid going overboard on calories or saturated fat, says Johnson. When it comes to ground meat, check the label for cuts that are at least 90 percent to keep saturated fat lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, our experts say there are some benefits to grass fed cuts, but you don’t need to break the bank for them. “Grass-fed beef does have a better omega-3 profile compared to conventional beef, but it's not going to be your main source of omega-3, so just kind of think of that as a nutritional bonus, and not a substitute for something like salmon,” says Johnson. “The real benefit is overall quality and how the animal was raised.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Cut Back On Red Meat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Divide Your Plate Into Sections:&lt;/strong&gt; Build your plate around plants instead of making meat “the main event of the meal,” says Johnson. Half of your plate should be non-starchy vegetables, like spinach salad, asparagus, and mixed vegetables. Then, one forth of your plate can be protein, like chicken, fish, or steak. The remaining one fourth of your plate can be high-fiber carbs like sweet potatoes, quinoa, or whole wheat pasta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cut Your Portion In Half:&lt;/strong&gt; “Cut your red meat portions in half and replace that half with a non-heme plant,” says Johnson. For example, if you are using ground beef for taco night, you could use half of your ground beef and use black beans or lentils as the other half. This would decrease your red meat intake while adding other nutrients like fiber to your meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swap Your Red Meat For Something Leaner:&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of using red meat, swap it for a leaner source of protein, like chicken, turkey, fish, or shellfish, says Johnson. For example, ground beef can be swapped for ground turkey to make turkey burgers, or chili and ground chicken can be made into meatballs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick A Few Meals A Week That Are Plant-Based: &lt;/strong&gt;If you’re transitioning toward a plant-based diet, Langer recommends aiming for at least two to three meatless meals per week. Try using tofu, beans, lentils, and tempeh as a main protein source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re cutting back on meat, it’s important to know how to get the most out of your non-heme iron sources like lentils, chickpeas, tofu, spinach, and quinoa. “Pair them with vitamin C-rich foods to help your body absorb the iron more effectively,” Johnson says. Think: lentils with bell peppers, chickpeas with tomatoes, or a spinach and berry smoothie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 12:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE9JdXFWd3lfNHVVdjEwbnhCT1V4ZkEzOEsxaWFQLVF5WjhhVVFyMEhIak96RDk4MUpBS2hBZjVMaFJRZ3NDU011ZVJMWGwyUE50b2VxOUlBZEVkdW1uVjRhNGpZTDhTMF9EV3lj</guid></item><item><title>麻疹在加拿大、墨西哥和美国爆发，跨越北美边境-美联社新闻 | Measles jumps borders in North America with outbreaks in Canada, Mexico and US - AP News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPS2dDdXhZeFVEUWtNTHhKbjFXYlQ0ZEU3bVFrTkNERnBlcFJXdXBaNjEyaE92R2dLYWxfVmhLV3pwbXN3a0pOREtndGRfUlhqS1JaRWpZZEVIUTRfNDg4RWhseFFkTm5UMjJ5QW0xZWYtdWZHR3p6SWdWM2hkN2ZfVTFzS3VFQTlyc19VMnJIZlMzYnluUUlzNUx2WQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxPS2dDdXhZeFVEUWtNTHhKbjFXYlQ0ZEU3bVFrTkNERnBlcFJXdXBaNjEyaE92R2dLYWxfVmhLV3pwbXN3a0pOREtndGRfUlhqS1JaRWpZZEVIUTRfNDg4RWhseFFkTm5UMjJ5QW0xZWYtdWZHR3p6SWdWM2hkN2ZfVTFzS3VFQTlyc19VMnJIZlMzYnluUUlzNUx2WQ</guid></item><item><title>顶级营养师经常食用5种高蛋白、高纤维食物，而不是肉类，以改善肠道健康- Business Insider | 5 high-protein, high-fiber foods a top nutritionist eats regularly instead of meat for better gut health - Business Insider</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxNSUJqbjY5OFVPUEt4bDhwQ29fVm5WWjhXSGZEUzJ0bUtNQ0FwRTM5Q3ZjOE8tOS1WY0hHdWtLMllBOWpzT3N4U01xR2psUHNSejlYWHFxTWdKMHlDZEhWdW42QnhmMkIwQlV3c0p2WWYydS1NcmlRcHgzbGlRaDdrTE5NU1k3TkJwNHFRRzhKZi0wZHZSOUMtN0k1dGotWXdJVWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="post-body-content post-story-body-content" data-component-type="post-body-content" data-load-strategy="exclude" data-track-content="" data-post-type="story"&gt;
            
              &lt;p&gt;You don't need to be scoffing steaks or gorging on protein shakes to get enough of the macronutrient — a top nutritionist says &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-nutritious-plant-based-proteins-soy-seitan-pulses-2021-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;plant-based protein&lt;/a&gt; is the best kind, and better for your gut health than meat, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federica Amati, Ph.D., is the lead nutritionist at ZOE, a science and nutrition company, and a postdoctoral medical scientist at Imperial College London. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/high-protein-foods-rule-easy-fat-loss-lose-pounds-2024-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Hitting protein targets&lt;/a&gt; is currently a huge health trend. But Amati told Business Insider that most people get enough, and don't need to worry about eating more protein unless they're an athlete or actively trying to change their body composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; people get their protein from matters, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amati referred to a 2024 study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition involving 50,000 healthy nurses aged 30-55 at the start of the study, between 1984 and 2016. The nurses who ate more protein, and specifically &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/eat-more-protein-boost-gut-health-same-time-easy-doctor-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;plant protein&lt;/a&gt;, had a higher chance of being free from 11 major chronic diseases, having good mental health, and not having cognitive or physical impairments as they aged. Meanwhile, participants who ate more animal protein had an increased risk of chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding is echoed in a 2021 study by researchers at the University of Oxford, published in the journal BMC Medicine. The 474,985 middle-aged British participants who ate more red and processed meat were more likely to develop heart disease, pneumonia, diabetes, and growths in the colon. Participants who ate more poultry were at higher risk of gastrointestinal diseases and diabetes, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amati said the results of the 2024 study suggested that the health benefits came from eating more fruit, vegetable, and whole foods, not protein. The researchers argued this could be because the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-spector-increase-fiber-plant-based-protein-sources-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;dietary fiber&lt;/a&gt;, micronutrients, and polyphenols in plant foods are associated with positive health effects, including reduced low-density lipoprotein, or "bad," cholesterol, lower blood pressure, and decreased inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Amati still has animal-based proteins: She eats oily fish twice a week, and eggs and fermented dairy — kefir and Greek yogurt specifically — regularly. But most of her protein comes from plants, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you don't go fully plant-based, research suggests it's possible to make a "huge" reduction in your chronic disease risk by replacing some animal protein with plants, Amati said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She shared some of the best sources of &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-spector-increase-fiber-plant-based-protein-sources-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;high-fiber plant protein&lt;/a&gt; that she eats regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1b82631c-db68-416f-9860-0e05347d85d9" data-toc-id="1b82631c-db68-416f-9860-0e05347d85d9"&gt;Nutritional yeast&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/nutritional-yeast" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Nutritional yeast&lt;/a&gt;, or "nooch," is deactivated yeast that has a cheesy flavor and contains B vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a nice example of a food that has both protein and fiber," Amati said. In terms of nutritional value, 100 grams of nooch contains about 50 grams of protein and about 20 grams of fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-mediterranean-diet-chef-adds-plant-based-protein-to-meals-2025-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;dietitian who follows the Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; previously told BI she incorporates nooch into her diet by sprinkling it on savory dishes as a cheese replacement. Amati's colleague at ZOE, the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/top-nutrition-scientist-tim-spector-foods-kitchen-gut-health-easy-2025-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;gut health expert Tim Spector&lt;/a&gt;, uses it instead of bouillon cubes to add flavor to his cooking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="3750505b-b354-44bf-95ec-09a54c636def" data-toc-id="3750505b-b354-44bf-95ec-09a54c636def"&gt;Soy products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/is-soy-bad-for-you" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Soy products&lt;/a&gt; are good sources of protein and fiber. For example, there are about 10 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber in 100 grams of edamame beans, and around 20 grams of protein and 7 grams of fiber in 100 grams of tempeh. And 100 grams of tofu contains about 8 grams of protein but less than 1 gram of fiber.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers suggested that this may have been because the estrogen-like compounds in tofu could have led to effects that mirror the beneficial effects of estrogen in women who weren't taking supplemental hormones — or because the fiber and minerals found in tofu help to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="3d5bd72e-b8c9-46b9-80cf-14521279c859" data-toc-id="3d5bd72e-b8c9-46b9-80cf-14521279c859"&gt;Oats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amati often eats oatmeal or &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trying-ree-drummond-easy-overnight-oats-recipe" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;overnight oats&lt;/a&gt; in the morning, adding kefir, chia seeds, and fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

It also, unfortunately, means ticks â€” including those that play host to bacteria that cause Lyme disease,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the most common tick-borne illness in the US. The bacteria, which larval ticks pick up when they feed on infected rodents, can cause headache, joint pain, a telltale bullseye rash, and more serious symptoms in humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Lyme-transmitting ticks, known as black-legged or deer ticks, were once largely balkanized to coastal New England. (The disease is named for a Connecticut town where researchers in the 1970s first described it, although &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/ancient-history-of-lyme-disease-in-north-america-revealed-with-bacterial-genomes/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;it has existed for millennia&lt;/a&gt;.) But in recent decades, the ticksâ€™ range has expanded. Lyme is now &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/data-research/facts-stats/lyme-disease-case-map.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;pervasive in the northeastern US&lt;/a&gt;, with large numbers of cases detected as far west as Minnesota and as far south as Virginia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Todayâ€™s newsletter explains why ticks have become more widespread â€” and how to keep them from crawling all over you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Two factors have combined to produce ideal conditions for more Lyme-causing ticks to come into contact with more humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;One is global warming. Climate change has kept the Northeast hotter and more humid for longer on average, stretching the ticksâ€™ active season from early spring into the late summer or early fall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;â€œWhen I was starting to work on this back in the 1970s, 1980s, we really didnâ€™t see new cases until May,â€� said Dr. Allen Steere, a rheumatologist at Harvard Medical School who was among &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2019/08/22/lyme-disease-how-discovered-and-where-from-here/KVovTbvJsJ8HIhx4K7yYQI/story.html?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2019/08/22/lyme-disease-how-discovered-and-where-from-here/KVovTbvJsJ8HIhx4K7yYQI/story.html?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;the first researchers to study Lyme&lt;/a&gt;. Today, infections in the northeast typically start rising in March. Adi Shah, who treats patients with severe Lyme at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, told me heâ€™s seen cases in November or December.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The deer tickâ€™s moniker suggests the second factor behind its proliferation. Less hunting and fewer natural predators have caused New Englandâ€™s population of white-tailed deer â€” on whose backs the ticks breed â€” &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/12/27/data/massachusetts-deer-population/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/12/27/data/massachusetts-deer-population/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter "&gt;to skyrocket&lt;/a&gt;. â€œEvery deer represents, basically, a dating site,â€� said Stephen Rich, a microbiologist at UMass Amherst. One deer can feed up to a thousand ticks, each of which can lay up to 4,000 eggs, he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Suburban sprawl, lawns that abut woods, and gardens with plants that deer see as tasty snacks have also invited more of them into spaces that humans frequent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Thereâ€™s one surefire way to avoid getting Lyme: â€œDonâ€™t get bitten,â€� says Thomas Mather, a University of Rhode Island tick expert.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Chemicals can lessen the chances. Rich, the UMass microbiologist, suggests getting your property treated with &lt;a href="https://web.uri.edu/tickencounter/prevention/protect-your-yard/perimeter-treatments/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://web.uri.edu/tickencounter/prevention/protect-your-yard/perimeter-treatments/"&gt;bifenthrin, an insecticide&lt;/a&gt;. If you live in a tick-infested area, Mather says, spray your clothes and shoes with permethrin, another chemical, once a month. If youâ€˜re traveling to a Lyme hotspot, apply a repellant like DEET every few hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There are sartorial solutions, too. If hiking, wear long pants and sleeves, tuck in your shirt, and tuck your pants inside your socks. Tight-fitting clothes, like leggings, offer ticks fewer points of entry. Shower after you come inside and do a tick check. â€œThey tend to get in the areas where your body forms a Y,â€� Rich said, like leg and arm joints.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And donâ€™t forget about your pets! Ticks like to burrow behind dogsâ€™ and catsâ€™ ears and beneath their collars. If yours spend time outside, check them regularly and keep them up to date with flea and tick prevention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Suppose you spot a tick on you. What then? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Finding one crawling on you may be creepy, but good news: it probably hasnâ€™t bitten you yet. If it has, use tweezers to grasp the tick close to your skin &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/after-a-tick-bite/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/after-a-tick-bite/index.html"&gt;and pull it away gently&lt;/a&gt;, to avoid getting its mouthparts stuck in you. (Gross, I know.) Be careful not to squeeze its body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Different tick species carry different types of bacteria and viruses, so the next step if youâ€˜ve been bitten is to figure out what youâ€˜re dealing with. Consult &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alpha-gal-syndrome/in-depth/tick-species/art-20546861" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;this visual guide&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://web.uri.edu/tickencounter/tickspotters/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;send a photo to TickSpotters&lt;/a&gt;, Matherâ€™s program at URI, which will identify the tick for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;How long the tick has been there also matters. Ticks swell as they feed on your blood, so if you suspect it has, consider sending it to a lab &lt;a href="https://web.uri.edu/tickencounter/testing/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;that can test it for germs&lt;/a&gt;. Just put the pest into a sealed zip-lock bag and overnight it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In the northeast, about half of adult deer ticks carry germs that cause Lyme disease, so if you pull one of those off you, thereâ€™s a good chance youâ€˜ve been exposed. Many cases of Lyme are mild and resolve quickly with the antibiotic doxycycline. But others can cause lasting fatigue, brain fog, or even brain inflammation and heart problems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Lyme can be hard to diagnose, and some patients experience &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/03/28/magazine/i-was-convinced-i-didnt-have-lyme-disease-guess-what/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/03/28/magazine/i-was-convinced-i-didnt-have-lyme-disease-guess-what/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter "&gt;a dizzying array of symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. â€œIt is not a well understood phenomenon, and itâ€™s also quite difficult to treat effectively,â€� Steere, of Harvard, said of such cases. A blood test can determine whether you have antibodies that indicate an infection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Of course, the best peace of mind comes from not getting bitten at all. â€œI know patients who get Lyme disease and it is very debilitating,â€� said Shah, of the Mayo Clinic. â€œIt does take you out of commission.â€�&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="divider"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_center"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;ðŸ§© 1 Down: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/games/mini-crossword/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Pointers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;b&gt;| â˜€ï¸� 58Âº &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/04/30/metro/boston-new-england-forecast/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;A cooler note&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="divider"&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

who have a biopsy due to an elevated PSA level are found to have prostate cancer," states the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study did have some limitations, chiefly the low number of samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The urine prostate cancer prediction model was performed on a small data set and appears to be largely an analysis of European men, both of which may limit its applicability to other high-risk prostate cancer populations," Abramowitz noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test could also come with a significant cost increase due to the specialized equipment necessary to perform the analyses, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledged the need for larger studies to validate the findings and to potentially include other cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;This work may pave the way for more specific screening methods that improve our ability to detect high-grade cancers before they progress or metastasize, ultimately improving cure rates and reducing treatment-related morbidity."&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While this study was focused specifically on prostate cancer, we believe that some of the methods could be generalized to other cancers as well, which we would like to try in our future studies," Smelik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal, according to the researchers, is to achieve more efficient screening programs within the next few years, potentially helping to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/cancer-research" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:prevent and treat prostate cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;prevent and treat prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showalter agreed, adding, "This work may pave the way for more specific screening methods that improve our ability to detect high-grade cancers before they progress or metastasize, ultimately improving cure rates and reducing &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:treatment-related;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;treatment-related&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High cholesterol is a serious health condition that describes an excess of fatty deposits in the blood arteries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Should a blockage form in the artery to the brain, a stroke will occur; if a blockage develops in the artery that delivers blood to the heart muscle, a heart attack ensues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you have been diagnosed with borderline or high cholesterol, you must alter what you are eating to help protect yourself against life-threatening cardiac or brain events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other key lifestyle changes include quitting smoking, cutting back on alcohol, and regular cholesterol checks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's also important to exercise more to help lower cholesterol levels; the health body advises everybody to do at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This could be broken down into daily brisk walks, cycling, or swimming – any movement that feels like a workout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Try a few different exercises to find something you like doing," the NHS says.

   &lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-personalisation" class="checktheseout2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
  &lt;p&gt;"When you eat as much fibre as we do, you can get gassy. We walked, cue the farts, and the legendary fart walk was born,” she wrote on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, doctors say this light post-meal activity could be one of the simplest ways to support gut health, lower blood sugar, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tim Tiutan, an internal medicine specialist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre, said that he "totally supports the fart walk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to him in an Instagram Reel, light movement after eating helps the intestines move gas along and prevents constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3119587/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Japanese researchers revealed that walking suppresses the glucose increase after a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Walking at a brisk speed for 30 minutes as soon as possible just after lunch and dinner leads to more weight loss than does walking for 30 minutes beginning one hour after a meal has been consumed," the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts also agree that timing is key. To get the most out of &lt;a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/health/story/interval-walking-boosts-heart-health-and-helps-you-reduce-weight-what-is-it-2715251-2025-04-26" target="_blank"&gt;your post-meal walk&lt;/a&gt;, start within an hour of eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you wait too long, you’ll miss the spike because it starts going up within minutes after you eat," said Dr. Christopher Damman, a gastroenterologist at the Digestive Health Center at University of Washington Medical Centre, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t require intense effort. Walking helps your bowels move and lowers your blood sugar. You don’t need to do intense workouts, just five minutes of moving can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/visualstories/health/walking-or-running-which-is-better-for-fat-loss-weight-management-exercise-229857-30-04-2025" target="_blank"&gt;walking even 5 to 15 minutes&lt;/a&gt; after a meal can reduce the typical spike in blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Yale Medicine, after you eat, your blood sugar goes up as your body starts absorbing sugars from the food. If you’ve skipped breakfast, your blood sugar can rise even more after lunch or dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually, the body uses a hormone called insulin to keep blood sugar in check. But sometimes, it doesn’t make enough insulin or doesn’t respond to it properly.&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-drupal-entity"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="shoppingWidget_mobile"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="shoppingWidgetLSH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can lead to high blood sugar, also called hyperglycemia. If it’s not managed, it can cause serious health problems like damage to the eyes, kidneys, and heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when you add a bit of exercise, &lt;a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/which-walk-is-more-effective-for-weight-loss-empty-stomach-or-post-meal-stmp-2679595-2025-02-15" target="_blank"&gt;as simple as walking&lt;/a&gt;, it can immediately bring down the spiked blood sugar level and even aid in fat loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also cardiac benefits when it comes to walking after meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking after a meal can help get your heart rate up for a while, which enables healthy blood flow through the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Cancer Society recommends adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity (equal to a brisk walk, at a pace of 3 miles per hour) or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity (makes your heartbeat and breathing faster, and makes you sweat) each week, preferably spread throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "fart walk" might sound like a joke, but it’s actually a habit backed by doctors. It’s simple, free, and can help you stay healthier for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dottedimg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="authors__container"&gt;&lt;div class="authors__by"&gt;&lt;p class="authlable"&gt;Published By: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="authdetaisl"&gt;ITGD Sr Sub Editor &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="published__on"&gt;&lt;p class="authlable"&gt;Published On: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="authdetaisl"&gt;May 1, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

He joined a high-end longevity clinic for a few hundred dollars a month and began monitoring his blood panels, eating better and improving his sleep. He wanted to stay active as he aged — playing tennis, surfing, hiking and spending time with his young daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But during Mr. Provissiero’s annual physical at the longevity clinic, his physician, Dr. Darshan Shah, gave him a sobering warning. Despite his healthy habits, Mr. Provissiero’s blood sugar was nearing &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/well/blood-sugar-levels-diabetes.html" title=""&gt;prediabetic levels&lt;/a&gt;. A family history heightened his risk of developing diabetes, which can shave years off a person’s life expectancy. When a stricter diet and exercise regimen didn’t move the needle, Dr. Shah prescribed metformin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Scientists have known for decades that metformin lowers blood sugar. It’s approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat Type 2 diabetes and is also commonly prescribed for weight loss and polycystic ovary syndrome. But some doctors, including Mr. Provissiero’s, are betting this same drug can head off a number of chronic diseases before they even develop, to help otherwise healthy people live longer and better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“The hope is that this is going to lead to a greater number of healthy years,” said Mr. Provissiero, who lives in Malibu, Calif. After one year on metformin, he said he feels less bloated, more energetic and more in control of his weight and blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Research on metformin’s impact on the human life span is scant. The existing research, much of which has been done on mice, is “all over the place,” showing varying effects based on the animals’ sex and species, said Rafael de Cabo, a senior investigator at the National Institute on Aging who has studied metformin in mice for over two decades. Human studies, which have largely focused on diabetes patients, turn up conflicting findings on metformin’s benefits for healthy people, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Still, interest in metformin’s anti-aging potential has remained high as scientists find early but promising evidence that it could also manage or delay other conditions like &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.diabetesresearchclinicalpractice.com/article/S0168-8227(19)31471-8/abstract" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-022-04649-4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2810994" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;. “Metformin may be targeting the root cause” of several other diseases whose risks increase with age, potentially because it regulates hormones, repairs tissues and eases immune system inflammation, Dr. de Cabo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drinks we’ve heard are bad for blood sugar may actually be helpful, say dietitians.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These include unsweetened coffee and tea, milk, juice and soy milk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instead, try to avoid sugary drinks like soda, sweet tea and syrupy lattes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you’re trying to manage your blood sugar, finding a drink that won’t spike your numbers can seem like a challenge. But what if we told you there are beverages you may be avoiding that are compatible with—and even advantageous for—blood sugar management? It’s true! Many of the drinks we’re often told are bad for blood sugar contain compounds that may support healthy blood sugar levels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, there are some drinks that really are problematic for blood sugar. To set the record straight, we asked dietitians to weigh in on drinks that get an unfair rap for blood sugar management, plus ones to avoid. Here’s what they told us. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-coffee"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Coffee &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8037224/drinking-coffee-inflammation-diabetes-risk-research/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Coffee&lt;/a&gt; fans, we’ve got good news! “Coffee without added sweetener may actually be beneficial to blood sugar,” says &lt;a href="http://erinpalinski.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Erin Palinski-Wade, RD, CDE&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and author of &lt;em&gt;2 Day Diabetes Diet.&lt;/em&gt; “Drinking black coffee has been associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes and a slowed progression of the disease.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Palinski-Wade points to the presence of chlorogenic acids in coffee. These compounds function as antioxidants that may reduce inflammation. That’s important because unchecked inflammation can make it harder for your body to use its own insulin, impairing glucose metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And it doesn’t matter if you prefer full-test or decaf; both kinds of coffee contain chlorogenic acid. The most important thing is to make sure your coffee is unsweetened to avoid added sugars.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-dairy-milk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Dairy Milk  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dairy milk gets an unfair reputation in so many ways. Perhaps you’ve heard it promotes inflammation or that its sugars can raise blood sugar. You can relax, says Palinski-Wade. “&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031955/is-dairy-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dairy milk&lt;/a&gt; often is looked at as being bad for blood sugar due to the natural sugar (lactose) it contains,” she says. “However, this drink is balanced with protein, carbs and fats, allowing it to have a minimal impact on blood sugar.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, some research has found a correlation between increased dairy intake and a &lt;em&gt;reduced&lt;/em&gt; risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “The exact reason isn’t known, says Palinski-Wade. “However, it may be due to beneficial nutrients, including vitamin D and magnesium found in dairy, which can help to improve insulin sensitivity.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “100% fruit juice can be part of a diabetes meal plan and keep blood sugar balanced,” says Palinski-Wade. Trouble is, the natural sugar in juice frequently causes people to avoid it, even though natural sugar is very different from added sugar. How so? “Natural sugars—unlike added sugar—are generally bound in a matrix of fiber, antioxidants and other beneficial nutrients that can help blood sugar, not hurt it,” says Palinski-Wade.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re skeptical, consider the results of a recent study that found that moderate fruit juice consumption doesn’t increase the risk of type 2 diabetes or negatively impact blood sugar control.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In addition to fruit juice’s impressive nutrition and antioxidant profile, it has a lower glycemic index than sugar-sweetened beverages. So, it’s unlikely to flood your bloodstream with sugar the same way as soda or sweet tea.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Juice can be enjoyed alone or used in recipes as a natural way to sweeten your dish,” says Palinski-Wade. “I recommend looking for juice that contains fiber naturally, such as 100% prune juice, and keeping your portion size to a half-cup at a time for blood sugar balance.” Or, pair it with a source of protein to slow the absorption of its sugars, like a handful of nuts or slice of cheese, says &lt;a href="http://www.samanthacassetty.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Samantha Cassetty, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition and wellness expert and co-author of &lt;em&gt;Sugar Shock&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are a lot of&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/myths-about-soy-you-need-to-stop-believing-11706042" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; unfounded myths about soy&lt;/a&gt;. One that you might have heard is that soy milk raises blood sugar. Is it true?  “Unsweetened soy milk is one of my go-to plant-based milks because it matches the protein in dairy milk,” says Cassetty. It’s also low in carbs, making it a healthy option when you’re managing your blood sugar, she says. In fact, 1 cup of unsweetened soy milk provides 8 grams of protein, just like dairy milk, and roughly 9 grams of carbohydrates, depending on the brand.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, soy milk’s protein can further slow down the impact of other carbs in your meal or snack. “So, if you’re having a bowl of cereal or oatmeal, serving it with soy milk can help stabilize your blood sugar,” says Cassetty.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, looking for a variety with no added sugars is key, she adds. “Sometimes plain versions contain a small amount of sweetener, so you need to read labels until you find a brand that doesn’t,” she says.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Remember how coffee’s chlorogenic acids do good things for blood sugar? Turns out, tea boasts its own blood sugar–friendly compounds called catechins. Research has found that catechins from both green and black tea may regulate blood sugar in multiple ways, such as improving the body’s ability to use insulin, guarding against &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and functioning as antioxidants to combat oxidative stress.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “They may also feed your good gut bacteria, which may help your body’s insulin work more effectively to clear sugar from your blood,” says Cassetty. No wonder tea is among our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-antioxidant-drinks-for-diabetes-8667246" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;top antioxidant-rich drinks for diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, when it comes to reaping tea’s benefits, the less you add, the better, says Cassetty. “Try to drink tea plain without any sweetener, whether that’s sugar or a zero-calorie sweetener,” she says.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even healthy drinks can raise blood glucose if they contain added sugar. In addition to searching the Nutrition Facts panel for added sugars, try these strategies:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retrain Your Taste Buds. &lt;/strong&gt;If your favorite beverages contain added sugars, Cassetty recommends slowly weaning yourself off them. “The real key is to get your taste buds used to drinking plain, unsweetened drinks with no added sugar and no other sweeteners,” she says. (More on this next!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swap Part of Your Sugary Drink with an Unsweetened Version. &lt;/strong&gt;This works for tea, coffee, and plant-based and flavored milks. Start with a ratio of 75% sweetened to 25% unsweetened. Then, keep adjusting until you’re favoring the unsweetened. Over time, you may not need the sweetened at all!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downsize. &lt;/strong&gt;If you’re not quite ready to say goodbye to your sugar-sweetened coffee or tea habit, switch to a smaller cup. It’s a small change that can help until you’re ready to make the move to unsweetened versions.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the Caffeine&lt;/strong&gt;. Some people can experience an increase in blood sugar levels when they consume large amounts of caffeine. If you notice that caffeine makes your numbers spike, switch to decaf or a half-caf blend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to what to drink for better blood sugar, there’s a lot of confusion and misinformation! The truth is, many drinks you might have heard are bad for your blood sugar (and that you may be avoiding!) may help with blood sugar management. According to dietitians, unsweetened coffee and tea, dairy milk, 100% fruit juice and soy milk can all be part of a blood sugar–friendly diet. Ideally, the goal is to aim for drinks that are free of added sugars. However, if you’re not ready to say goodbye to sugar entirely, think baby steps. By slowly weaning yourself off of sugar-sweetened drinks, you can retrain your taste buds over time.&lt;br&gt;

The NHS points out that "how often people pass stool differs from one individual to another", stating: "Most people will have a bowel movement between three times a day and three times a week.", reports &lt;a target="_self" rel="Follow" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/one-toilet-habit-not-just-31527271" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link"&gt;Surrey Live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The guidance highlights that individuals should seek medical advice "if you notice any persistent change in your bowel habit, such as needing to go to the toilet more often, having looser stool, bleeding from your bottom or stomach pain".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 2018 study in the USA found that a whopping 95.9% of participants reported having between 3 and 21 bowel movements weekly, reinforcing the widely accepted '3 and 3' rule (three times a day to three times a week) for normal frequency. The research also proposed different benchmarks for stool consistency based on gender.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="35149931" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2023, and a new study from the USA indicates that the most typical bowel pattern is once daily. Interestingly, the study revealed that individuals who passed four soft stools weekly had a 1.78 times higher risk of dying within five years compared to those with a standard seven weekly bowel movements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, less frequent bowel movements were linked to a 2.42 and 2.27 increased risk of death from cancer and cardiovascular diseases, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sean Gibbons from the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle refers to the optimal frequency of bowel movements for &lt;a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/health" target="_self" rel="Follow" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section-topic"&gt;health &lt;/a&gt;as the "Goldilocks zone": one to three times daily. Gibbons' research further classified bathroom routines into distinct categories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Individuals who made trips to the toilet one to three times daily were found to have a greater amount of beneficial gut bacteria and more microbes that produce short-chain fatty acids, which are known to reduce inflammation in the body. #&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation is now believed to be a key factor in diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and even Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those who had bowel movements less than three times a week seemed to have higher levels of toxins in their blood associated with chronic kidney disease and Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;section data-embed-group="read-more" data-embed-items="2" data-ad-dockable="true" data-redesign-embed="true"&gt; &lt;aside class="read-more-links" data-mod="readMoreTweak" data-immediate=""&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gibbons explained to the BBC that constipated individuals may have increased harmful toxins in their bloodstream because, after consuming all available fibre, gut bacteria begin to ferment proteins, releasing damaging toxins into the blood that can harm organs like the kidneys and heart and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"If you have chronically high levels of this metabolite in your circulation, it can promote atherosclerosis, a kind of hardening of the arteries and damage to the cardiovascular system," Gibbons stated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added, "It's hard to say definitively, because we don't have causal data to know whether these people went on to get sick in the future, but it does seem to be the case that, based on what we were looking at, pooping every other day to a couple of times a day is probably a better window to be healthy."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Interpreting health studies can often be complex, as it's challenging to draw definitive conclusions about whether a specific habit or aspect of our health is the direct cause of an outcome until substantial evidence accumulates. Many health outcomes are correlative rather than causative—for instance, individuals who are generally unhealthy might also experience less frequent bowel movements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microbiome scientist Emily Leeming from King's College London shared insights with the BBC following her research on gut transit times—the duration it takes for food to travel through the body and be excreted: "What we found was that people who had a longer transit time tended to have more 'bad' gut bacteria, so bacteria that have previously been linked to having worse heart health and metabolic health."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;section data-embed-group="read-more" data-embed-items="2" data-ad-dockable="true" data-redesign-embed="true"&gt; &lt;aside class="read-more-links" data-mod="readMoreTweak" data-immediate=""&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What should poo look like?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Emily Leeming, a microbiome expert at King's College London, explained to the BBC the importance of monitoring one's stool: "We should all be looking at our poo, because it's basically like a free gut health test. It's not just how often you go, it's also colour and the shape of your poo as well.

has a dark secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The community of just over 15,000 residents has &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14647121/subtle-clue-EYE-dementia-45-retinal-thinning.html"&gt;one of the highest dementia rates&lt;/a&gt; in America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One in four people here over the age of 65 have it compared to around one in 10 nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And that is probably only the 'tip of the iceberg', according to Dr Gladys Maestre, director  of a dedicated dementia and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14635517/virus-herpes-shingles-SEVEN-TIMES-early-dementia.html"&gt;Alzheimer's research program&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told the Daily Mail the number of sufferers is likely 'much, much higher', as many people don't have health insurance and cases therefore go unreported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Residents in the city and the surrounding Starr County area say that almost everyone has someone in their family impacted by the condition, which causes loss of memory, language, problem-solving and other thinking abilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Maestre: 'Access to health is difficult in the area, so I believe we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg. I have also seen so many people aged around 50 already sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The only way to give accurate estimations is by doing an epidemiological study, door by door in this case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While it might appear a sleepy border town with an interesting history, Rio Grande City in southern Texas has a dark secret. The low laying community of just over 15,000 residents has one of the highest dementia rates in America, at around 25 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Asked what is behind the staggering number of dementia patients in Starr County, Dr Maestre says poverty is one big factor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The region has a poverty rate of around 30 percent, which is more than double the national average of just under 12 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe lower wages and disadvantaged neighborhoods can put people at a greater risk of dementia due to various factors including poorer air quality, a greater reliance on cars or bus transportation over walking, fewer social interactions and more stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Maestre says she believes that pollutants in the area are another big contributor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She identifies a handful of toxins that have been found in the water supply and in the town's old houses, many of which date back to the early and mid 19th century. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include arsenic which has been linked to reduced memory and intellectual abilities in children and adolescents, and cadmium, which is a carcinogen released into the environment through industrial and agricultural activities, known for contributing to the development of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another factor Dr Maestre highlights is the extreme heat in south Texas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A growing body of research has indicated a link between extreme heat and an increased risk of dementia-related deaths and hospitalizations, particularly among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study of over three million Medicare patients in New England found that temperature increases of 1.5C (34.7F) led to a 12 per cent rise in hospital admissions for dementia sufferers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation explains that heat can trigger dementia because 'prolonged exposure to the hot summer sun can place too much stress on the body, which negatively impacts cognitive function.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr James Falcon has been working with his physician father Antonio to lead more research into the problems plaguing Starr County&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Earlier this month it emerged that the remains of an 84-year-old Maria Soprano had been found in the city of Roma in Starr County after her family reported her missing. Authorities confirmed that she suffered from dementia and Alzheimer's&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Starr County, temperatures range from an average minimum of 44F in January to an average maximum of 99F in July, while the average annual temperature is 74F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is another factor creating a 'perfect storm' for dementia, says the doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The region is also heavily Hispanic and this demographic group is 1.5 times more likely to be affected by dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the exact reasons for this disparity are still being investigated, research suggests several factors may contribute, including cardiovascular disease, socioeconomic status, and potential genetic predispositions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with Dr Maestre, another leading dementia specialist in the region is Dr James Falcon, who has been working with his physician father Antonio to lead more research into the problems plaguing Starr County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The former soldier, who served in Afghanistan before returning to Rio Grande City, previously told Today: 'There isn't a single one of us that works here [in the clinic] that doesn't  know somebody personally that has been affected by this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For a while growing up we were the poorest county in the country, that's the reality of where we live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Working here in the clinic, there isn't a day that goes by where we don't see somebody with some kind of memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A lot of people are early in the course of their disease [but] you see pretty advanced patients.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services reports that 459,000 Texans have been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, around 12 percent of the state’s population over the age of 65&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In Starr County, temperatures range from an average minimum of 44F in January to an average maximum of 99F in July, while the average annual temperature is 74F&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mayra Garza, who has been helping as a volunteer at the Falcon's El Faro Health and Therapeutics clinic in Rio Grande City on Alzheimer's research, explains that it is an issue close to her heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website: 'My family has been highly impacted by this Alzheimer's disease, both my parents have / had it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is important to understand why this is impacting me and my family.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this month it emerged that the remains of an 84-year-old woman suffering from dementia had been found in the city of Roma in Starr County after her family reported her missing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Authorities confirmed that Maria Soprano suffered from dementia and Alzheimer's, which may have contributed to her becoming disoriented and lost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Maestre told this website that urgent action needs to be taken to prevent such devastating events from happening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She concludes: 'I think this is a perfect storm, where environmental issues and adverse early life experiences come together to make the brain more vulnerable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I say life experiences I mean not only pollutants, I mean extreme heat, and a car-centric environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'To make progress, we need more research on what is going on, and more infrastructure for care and prevention.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last week the Texas House passed a Senate bill that would create a $3 billion Texas research fund for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, if it goes ahead, would issue grants for research and encourage collaboration among universities, medical institutions and other experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services reports that 459,000 Texans have been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, around 12 percent of the state’s population over the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms include forgetfulness, irritability, struggling to follow a conversation or find the right word and being confused about time and place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 05:45:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>减肥药物可以治疗严重肝病患者- Euronews.com | Weight-loss drugs could treat patients with serious liver condition - Euronews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizgFBVV95cUxQOGlBQWZoeUVOSFZaRWtBc1NOd3VZWjFPMmxYeVQ1OEZDdE1NZXNDNFlmN1FRanVSdHlsN0pPeE4ydVNMbUhnaUR0WVJvMzZ6MHpqaFFTc3VuUnBNSDRlUzc1ekVLZm9BeWNJcVJ3N0M1UndtbU5pVER0WnlLYnVRV2VKY3JLMlZrV2puWHVpZzRiLXhnTmxqLTJydmU3bmYyRmI3OEJubjdCb0Z0NERRQkhOLVdaN2FKM080WkU5Zk1taDVDdXNCZXdiN01oUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;S��4a����G!i+��SDNZ{���7�ǯ?��S`0���0-�q�=^��WZ���X�P��N4P8{4iH�y"�����):�P�BTUhtK�n�a�{{]�z��߆��ͫ����닓*��%^YR���E5L3dɊKf�"�Tu���%~��D��._������a�yw� �.z�b

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC researchers analyzed data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance Project (NEISS-CADES).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The database keeps track of drug-related adverse events reported to a nationally representative sample of emergency departments in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on 551 documented cases, the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-03258"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;estimated 24,499 ED visits were due to semaglutide use between 2022 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of those, 70 percent were for GI symptoms, including 58 percent for nausea and vomiting, 25 percent with abdominal pain and 12 percent with diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seventeen percent of ED visits were because of low blood sugar and six percent of people were experiencing an allergic reaction to the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nine percent of the visits involved medication error.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the visits to the ED, about one-third of people with low blood sugar and 15 percent of people with GI symptoms were admitted to the hospital for closer observation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study did not reveal if any deaths related to the medications occurred. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain, vomiting and constipation are listed as common side effects of Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More severe side effects listed include thyroid tumors, changes in vision, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, dehydration and kidney complications, allergic reactions, food or liquid getting into the lungs and gallbladder complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After being resigned to being obese, Brad Roberts couldn't believe it when he lost 24lbs in a month on weight loss drugs. However, in a shocking turn of events, the 44-year-old father-of-four and his wife Stacey are suing the doctor who prescribed him the weight loss drugs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to these, Wegovy also lists depression or suicidal thoughts, kidney failure, and increased heart rate as side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one lawsuit, Ozempic user Brad Roberts claims&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14507341/ozempic-dieter-suing-doctor-treating-weight-loss-drug.html"&gt; the drug caused debilitating joint and muscle pain&lt;/a&gt;, as well as severe stomachaches that confined him to his bed for 18 hours a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other claims in the lawsuit include that he has trouble walking and suffers from memory loss, vision problems and issues communicating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one of the court documents obtained by DailyMail.com, Dr Yadira Lockard, a psychologist who has served as Roberts' therapist since January 2015, describes his deterioration after he was allegedly 'dangerously' overmedicated with weight loss drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she noticed a concerning change in his behavior about a year into his weight loss and eventually his condition deteriorated until he no longer had 'the mental capacity to make life decisions of any particular consequence to himself or on behalf of his family.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the FDA has received hundreds of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12636411/ozempic-weight-loss-suicide-thoughts-depression-fda.html"&gt;reports of suicidal thoughts and depression from patients on weight loss medications&lt;/a&gt; since 2010, as well as 36 deaths 'by suicide or suspected suicide.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of 2023, 265 reports of suicidal thoughts and depression among people on weight-loss drugs had been received by the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/wegovy-other-weight-loss-drugs-scrutinized-over-reports-suicidal-thoughts-2023-09-28/"&gt;Reuters &lt;/a&gt;reported, though instances of suicidal thoughts on the drugs are unverified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A DailyMail.com investigation last year revealed dozens of patients were suing Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, claiming they experienced extreme side effects they were not warned about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most of the patients claim they suffered from gastroparesis - stomach paralysis. The condition, which can be life-threatening, causes a build-up of food in the gut and symptoms include nausea, vomiting and severe pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brea Hand, 23, told DailyMail.com she required five hospital visits before doctors diagnosed her with gastroparesis, which was allegedly caused by Ozempic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DailyMail.com reviewed more than a dozen lawsuits filed between November 2023 and January 2024 by patients who were diagnosed with gastroparesis after using Ozempic and Wegovy, including some who suffered 'life-threatening' bowel injuries and now face lifelong consequences.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one case, a woman who used Ozempic and Mounjaro claims she was diagnosed with gastroparesis, which caused her to vomit so much some of her teeth feel out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another, a woman was diagnosed with a 'life-threatening bowel injury' after using Ozempic and underwent surgery that lasted nearly nine hours. Doctors said she would be in pain 'for the rest of her life' and 'will never have a solid bowel movement again.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the number of semaglutide-related hospital visits is concerning, it is on par with visits for side effects from other drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2021 &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8493432/#:~:text=Based%20on%2096%E2%80%89925%20cases%20(mean%20patient%20age%2C%2049%20years%3B%2055%25%20female)%2C%20there%20were%20an%20estimated%206.1%20(95%25%20CI%2C%204.8%2D7.5)%20ED%20visits%20for%20medication%20harms%20per%201000%20population%20annually%20and%2038.6%25%20(95%25%20CI%2C%2035.2%25%2D41.9%25)%20resulted%20in%20hospitalization."&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found roughly six in 1,000 Americans visit the ED every year due to medication-related complications and a 2022 &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34757641/"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found over-the-counter cough or cold medications cause about 27,000 ED visits in the US every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 02:32:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxNblo1bllhajIzS1M5T21mMlJEemFkWWZBbmQ2MTYxWkpvMTRmRm9zMXR4Y3FLekk2d0tVeElJcDNaV29uMVFGbDRzRHdkUjRoOFlMdmZ5QnBVanJ6bVd2UTdfUFk0YkFQck1RVzBqYjFVdTVUbFRiVUR2b3RFVDBSMndPVG9DWmg2X2FuQzZsMVhwYThYRHE0eTNuMTVlNjJnaE9Cdm4tU0NtcmlqSmNQWXc3Wmg5cEJTa1R4LWM5d1paWnJMbWdz0gHMAUFVX3lxTE83NmVfeFZPVGhiVUtnVUt0LTljc0FUb29Hd1ZEa1oyeEVMZGphaF9Uek9Pc3RqOUh2eVZ3bXNXSjgzVXhSUVZKVmtRR3U4c2dtOEtXTzZwSEV2VGt4UXJFTHkxNlJYWHNlU0pZdkgzSHRoNjFraFR6Q2ROU1lwTnlJOEhNQ0VVa2tIOTZabXNBb0lzbWp2RVFhS3FIUGZvZ3Z4MjJWOGpUSC0xSk1JYlNCd0tQNl9sSk52akpPcUZzclcyOTBLdjBGbTBxXw</guid></item><item><title>美国100个性传播疾病热点城市揭晓：这座令人震惊的富裕小镇隐藏着肮脏的秘密--《每日邮报》 | America's 100 STD hotspot cities revealed: And the shocking wealthy town with a dirty secret - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQQlJNT3p3Mnc5LUNseGRpaWZheEFOaFpIMHRZUUFMUHJRQTgxVU5PNVFTTlJ5OGZUaDBfUENONHNOY205Zm1OR1BHQmRaLUdYQVJCUllVMldZYTBZano5MDJyTGM4NzZDRFBMOUNLaEdoS3NPRUtSenBjYk0zVXJRbDJONXZvTVoxdTEzamM4enlNNmVFSjBkSUxqQmlXT29QNkxzX2tnTjM4d9IBrwFBVV95cUxOU3JzdHdSQmRObXhxSE44ZFFyMTctVWpwS21wSzR4QVJpYnNvTEdXb0REX0l6NEFDMkpaYUV2N0RUdFBxUEE2d3FPdi05Rm1jSnZrUmJLOXUtYlVrWndzM2dQTVdGWW05aWxsUm10M0lSQ2RKaWVVTHZsQ1FoUS1IZ09ibDF2dWFybG9OLU95cE9DamFvd3VtM0VPbTMyd3Q2a2pINDBQMTVRaFowcGxr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cities in the eastern half of the US may be rife with sexually transmitted infections, a new analysis shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Innerbody Research, a medical website run by a team of scientists, examined &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-b8147080-253f-11f0-91e0-fd96e094411a" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;'s 2023 data for rates of STIs across America and found the 10 cities with the highest rate of infections, with Detroit, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/michigan/index.html" id="mol-b81756b0-253f-11f0-91e0-fd96e094411a"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, topping the list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Midwestern city had about 1,500 infections per 100,000 residents in 2023, jumping eight places from the previous year's report.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was followed by Philadelphia, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pennsylvania/index.html" id="mol-212b29e0-25c4-11f0-b349-7df794508157"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;

- the nation's capital and home to the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/white-house/index.html" id="mol-7179e890-25f7-11f0-ba72-17419599ac08"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; - was ranked in seventh place for the first time due to modern-day dating trends and new social constructs, experts say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Memphis, Tennessee; Baltimore, Maryland and New Orleans, Louisiana, made up fourth, fifth and sixth places, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;For the first time ever, the team named Detroit City as the metro area with the highest overall STI rates across the country&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Washington DC was &lt;span&gt;found to have a rate of 1,334 overall STI cases per 100,000 people as of 2023. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Broken down, there were 22,738 cases of chlamydia, 6,450 cases of gonorrhea, 489 cases of syphilis and 593 cases of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hiv_aids/index.html" id="mol-cb0bde61-2541-11f0-91e0-fd96e094411a" class=""&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The city, where reports suggest it takes having a net worth of over $2million to feel wealthy, has reportedly seen an uptick of cases among younger generations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Shenell Williams-Davis, a sexual health coordinator with Mary’s Center Public Health Outreach Services in DC, new dating trends and relationship structures may be to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtoninformer.com/std-rates-washington-dc/"&gt;The Washington Informer&lt;/a&gt;: 'The doors of [varied sexual preferences] have opened up, and a lot of people are starting to experience [a multitude of things]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's no longer just one-on-one [sexual relationships], but [people experiencing multiple partner relationships]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So that brings the issue where I may treat three people, but where are the other two in the group, or I can treat three, but where are the other four people? This [creates a breeding ground] for reinfection.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Despite making up only a quarter of the population, young people between 15 to 24 years old account up for about half of new STIs every year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Years of rising rates of STIs has culminated in what experts call a&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14074021/Americas-STD-explosion-laid-bare-shocking-number-people-catching-one-minute.html"&gt; public health crisis&lt;/a&gt;, driven by decreased condom usage and poor sex education. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Detroit saw &lt;/span&gt;20,830 cases of chlamydia, 7,983 cases of gonorrhea, 628 cases of syphilis and 386 cases of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hiv_aids/index.html" id="mol-4784c6d0-25f3-11f0-ba72-17419599ac08" class=""&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Across the US, Chlamydia is &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6784019/STD-rates-soar-record-high-driven-rising-rates-40s.html" class=""&gt;the most common STI&lt;/a&gt;, with 492.2 cases per 100,000 people as of 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the rate is increasing, mostly driven by a recent uptick in the number of seniors citizens contracting chlamydia due to increased sexual activity in later life, limited sexual health education, low condom use and the misconception that STIs don't affect older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is often called a 'silent infection' as many people experience no symptoms but if they do appear, they can be mild and may not show up for several weeks after exposure - making it easier to spread as people keep having unprotected sex without knowing they are suffering from the illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms of chlamydia include abnormal or foul-smelling vaginal discharge, pelvic pain, abdominal tenderness, pain during intercourse, irregular bleeding, and fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Untreated chlamydia can lead to several long-term complications, primarily affecting reproductive health, including infertility and ectopic pregnancy in women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Gonorrhea cases fell for a second year in 2024, declining seven percent from 2022 to below pre-pandemic levels due to an increased availability of at-home STI kits. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Untreated gonorrhea can lead to serious health issues, including pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. And while the infection can usually be easily treated, some strains are resistant to commonly used antibiotics - making them harder to clear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Syphilis has increased by one percent nationwide and the rise - while small - is worrying public health officials, as the disease can advance to damage the brain, nerves, eyes, and heart if it goes untreated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is most commonly reported among 30- to 34-year-olds, a slightly older group compared to other infections due to peak sexual activity during those years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms begin with small open sores on the genitals, mouth, or rectum, as well as enlarged lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the second stage, a skin rash develops, as well as genitals sores, fever, muscle and joint pain, vision changes, and loss of appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the infection advances further, it can inflame and damage heart valves and slowly degrade the brain, causing personality changes, memory loss, difficulty making decisions, and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While most of the illnesses can be cured with a round of antibiotics and abstinence from sex, HIV can attack the body's immune system and lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once infected with HIV, there is no effective cure currently and proper medical care to control the virus is required. In the US, approximately 8,000 people die each year from HIV-related illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Washington DC was found to have 1,334 overall STI cases per 100,000 people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People, particularly young people, are using condoms less regularly. They went from the top contraceptive tool for 75 percent of men in 2011 to 42 percent of men by 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite making up only a quarter of the population, young people between 15 to 24 years old account up for about half of new STIs every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in 100 US adults has an STI, including over 209,000 cases of syphilis, over 600,000 cases of gonorrhea, and over 1.6million &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-64252/What-symptoms-chlamydia.html"&gt;cases of chlamydia&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, there are some positive signs that a decade-long rise could be plateauing and even turning a corner. There were 2.4million sexually transmitted infections in 2023, a two percent decline from 2022.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eric Rodriguez, CEO and co-founder of Innerbody Research, SAID: 'The number one thing that an individual can do to help address this issue is to get tested more frequently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What we've found is that people don't realize how important it is to get tested regularly, because many STDs are manageable if they are caught early. Many of them are curable. But you can't manage and you can't cure what you don't know.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 02:32:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQQlJNT3p3Mnc5LUNseGRpaWZheEFOaFpIMHRZUUFMUHJRQTgxVU5PNVFTTlJ5OGZUaDBfUENONHNOY205Zm1OR1BHQmRaLUdYQVJCUllVMldZYTBZano5MDJyTGM4NzZDRFBMOUNLaEdoS3NPRUtSenBjYk0zVXJRbDJONXZvTVoxdTEzamM4enlNNmVFSjBkSUxqQmlXT29QNkxzX2tnTjM4d9IBrwFBVV95cUxOU3JzdHdSQmRObXhxSE44ZFFyMTctVWpwS21wSzR4QVJpYnNvTEdXb0REX0l6NEFDMkpaYUV2N0RUdFBxUEE2d3FPdi05Rm1jSnZrUmJLOXUtYlVrWndzM2dQTVdGWW05aWxsUm10M0lSQ2RKaWVVTHZsQ1FoUS1IZ09ibDF2dWFybG9OLU95cE9DamFvd3VtM0VPbTMyd3Q2a2pINDBQMTVRaFowcGxr</guid></item><item><title>驱动腹部脂肪生长的干细胞老化开关- ScienceAlert | Aging Switches on Stem Cells That Drive Belly Fat Growth - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPZkNYYk80c2tfQjRpX2pKd0JKOTJfU2FGZXpvam43XzBwYnV2ZmxKY2F0bExlbV93UDhHMWJncmFQcHRlc3BrRjRkVWh3MFB6U1RKVVhwMXhDOXJwSXh2TVp5MWctaFdETmtkalZaeWlFZGVlUEFMMXVNckJobHRfeXdlYUNQYTJhX2xEaEFn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Aging appears to unlock adult  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="159473" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; programmed to create more &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/whether-you-carry-fat-in-your-arms-or-legs-could-predict-risk-of-dementia"&gt;problematic belly fat cells&lt;/a&gt;, new research in mice and human tissues reveals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first evidence that our bellies expand with age due to the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="159473" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt;'s high output of new fat cells," &lt;a href="https://www.cityofhope.org/new-research-explains-why-our-waistlines-expand-in-middle-age"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; City of Hope endocrinologist Adolfo Garcia-Ocana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These age-specific stem cells, called committed preadipocytes (CP-As), are found in white fat tissue, which is known to increase in humans during &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/obesity-is-a-form-of-premature-ageing-scientists-say-and-we-need-to-rethink-it"&gt;age-related weight gain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People often lose muscle and gain body fat as they age – even when their body weight remains the same," &lt;a href="https://www.cityofhope.org/new-research-explains-why-our-waistlines-expand-in-middle-age"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; endocrinologist Qiong (Annabel) Wang from the Arthur Riggs &lt;span&gt;Diabetes&lt;/span&gt; and Metabolism Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We discovered aging triggers the arrival of a new type of adult stem cell and enhances the body's massive production of new fat cells, especially around the belly."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can occur &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/hidden-causes-of-weight-gain"&gt;even without changes in diet and exercise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_159475" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159475" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/DiagramOfFatStemCellsChangingWithAge.jpg" alt="Diagram of fat stem cell changing with age" class="wp-image-159475 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/DiagramOfFatStemCellsChangingWithAge.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/DiagramOfFatStemCellsChangingWithAge-600x342.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-159475" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Stem cells in young mice (APCs) only produce fat when stimulated by stressors, but some stem cells become more active with age (CP-As), producing the increasing amount of fat cells seen in male mouse bellies from middle age. (Wang et al., &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers transplanted stem cells from the white fat tissue in younger male mice to older male mice, they didn't produce fat cells. This means that something during the aging process is responsible for the change in how these cells proliferate, rather than the environment they're currently in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While most adult stem cells' capacity to grow wanes with age, the opposite holds true [here] – aging unlocks these cells' power to evolve and spread," &lt;a href="https://www.cityofhope.org/new-research-explains-why-our-waistlines-expand-in-middle-age"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Garcia-Ocana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team suggests this switch to greater fat production may be due to cell aging or immune dysregulation. More immune cells accumulate in white fat tissue with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RNA analysis identified changes between the young and old mouse stem cells, including one of the specific signaling pathways (leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, or LIFR) involved in telling these specific stem cells to make more fat. This might be a useful target for developing interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking samples from five humans of different ages (with only one female donor), the team found the same stem cells were more active in older humans as well as in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A larger sample size with more female donors is required to confirm this trend is universal, the researchers caution. Meanwhile, the best way to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercising-regularly-appears-to-make-your-belly-fat-healthier"&gt;keep on top&lt;/a&gt; of these age-related changes is to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/best-way-avoid-gaining-weight-age-metabolism-2018"&gt;increase your movement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Understanding the role of CP-As in metabolic disorders and how these cells emerge during aging could lead to new medical solutions for reducing belly fat and improving health and longevity," &lt;a href="https://www.cityofhope.org/new-research-explains-why-our-waistlines-expand-in-middle-age"&gt;concludes&lt;/a&gt; Wang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adj0430"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The great irony of my job is that I seldom get to ride my bike like I used to. But while I was sitting in Melbourne lamenting missing &lt;em&gt;Escape's&lt;/em&gt; annual Member Summit at the Spring Classics due to family commitments, I received a late invite to join the Rapha Cycling Club (RCC) summit in Kyoto. Given that's a much more doable four-day trip without jetlag, I couldn't say no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I wasn’t about to write a piece about riding down &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_blossom?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;sakura&lt;/a&gt;-lined roads, sushi breaks, and onsen soaks after big days in the saddle (although all of that did happen). No one needs to hear about me gloating about my perfect riding vacation. I wanted something deeper – a story that was more than just a scenic diary entry. I didn't know what that would be until the final night of the summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RCC summit brought together 130 riders from around the world to explore the backroads and mountain passes of Kyoto, a city with cycling routes as rich as its culture. On day one, I struck up a conversation with a softly spoken Japanese rider named Aki. He was riding a classic De Rosa with rim brakes and 80th anniversary Campy Record. My kinda guy. He pointed out how lucky we were to be there at the peak of sakura season and told me a little about the city. I didn't see him much for the next couple of rides, and I figured that was that – just one of the many friendly, fleeting interactions you have on these kinds of trips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the queen stage on Saturday, there was a final dinner where &lt;a href="https://escapecollective.com/new-ceo-fran-millers-vision-for-raphas-future/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Fran Millar&lt;/a&gt; (Rapha's new CEO) spoke about the renewed importance of RCC to the business and a bunch of fun awards were given out. One such award was given to Aki for his book – the first book ever published about RCC and how his first summit literally changed the course of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone wrote an entire book about RCC? This was the story I was waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-life-consumed-by-work"&gt;A life consumed by work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I became a member of Rapha RCC 10 years ago," Aki told me when we sat down for a proper chat. A dedicated internal medicine doctor specialising in renal dialysis, Aki's life was consumed by work before discovering RCC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have to work every day, from morning to night," he explained, describing the relentless pace that left no space for personal pursuits. "I work from 8am to 11 at night, almost every day. Only Sundays I can have for me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demands of running his own clinic with 40-50 employees meant he had no time for exercise. "I became so fat," he admitted with a smile. For nearly 30 years, the bicycle that had once been his passion in youth collected dust as Aki focused entirely on his medical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he turned 50, his daughters insisted on a health check-up. The results were a wake-up call. He was nearly 20 kg overweight and battling the silent beginnings of multiple lifestyle diseases. He knew the path he was on. As a doctor, he’d advised patients on it countless times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So he changed. Slowly, and then all at once. He adjusted his diet. He started exercising. He even dusted off the old road bike he’d bought in university – now a relic – and began riding again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, he discovered Rapha. Not the clothing, but the culture. “I just wanted to belong to something interesting,” he said. That sense of curiosity led him to join RCC, although he had no idea what it really was at the time. But when he saw an announcement for an RCC Summit in the south of France in 2017, something clicked. Aki made a decisive move that would alter his life's trajectory. "Until then, I had not been abroad since I was 30," he said. "So I lost my passport!" He decided this was his time to go overseas again. "I deserved that. So first I reserved the summit, then I went to get a new passport."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience was transformative. "It was only me, no other Japanese were there. But that's a good thing for me, because I had to communicate with other people. If there were a lot of Japanese there, maybe I don't speak to the foreigners. But since I was alone, I could enjoy the people and culture of foreign countries. That shocked me – it was so interesting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="https://escapecollective.com/content/images/2025/04/A--1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://escapecollective.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/A--1.jpg 600w, https://escapecollective.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/A--1.jpg 1000w, https://escapecollective.com/content/images/2025/04/A--1.jpg 1059w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that summit, Aki made a profound decision: "I decided I will work hard, but also I will work hard at enjoying my life, a lot. So every year after that, I go abroad for riding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-life-changing-connection"&gt;A life-changing connection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RCC community opened new worlds for Aki, but his story takes an even more meaningful turn through his connection with Christine O’Connell, a fellow RCC member from London. At the summit, he met this tall, middle-aged woman with short blonde hair who, like him, didn't look particularly fast but pedalled powerfully on long rides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I talked to her at breakfast, she seemed quiet," Aki recalled. He later found out she had just had surgery for breast cancer. A year later they discovered that the cancer had returned, but this time it had spread to her brain and bones, requiring more surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She may not look it, but she's a breast cancer survivor," Aki explained, recounting how the Rapha London community helped her prepare for and complete the challenging L'Étape du Tour race the very same year she underwent brain surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galvanised by her experience, Christine started "&lt;a href="https://www.onemorecity.cc/?ref=escapecollective.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;One More City&lt;/a&gt;," a charity campaign ride supporting breast cancer research. "The first year, they started only with four people, and it's open every year, getting larger and larger," Aki said with admiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aki described the concept's powerful symbolism; how cancer patients deal with their disease much like cyclists approach a long journey: handling treatment, enduring side effects, going through regular checkups, and overcoming problems one by one, moving towards their goals little by little, city by city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-parallel-journeys"&gt;The parallel journeys&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes Aki's story particularly powerful is the parallel between his own physical challenge and Christine's battle with cancer. Last year, just weeks before the Étape, Aki suffered a serious accident while training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hit a small animal on the mountain and crashed, and I broke my pelvis," he explained. "I couldn't walk, I couldn't ride." Most people would have cancelled, but Aki was determined. "I have only a few years left, so I decided to go anyway to France."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="https://escapecollective.com/content/images/2025/04/-1-.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://escapecollective.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/-1-.JPG 600w, https://escapecollective.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/-1-.JPG 1000w, https://escapecollective.com/content/images/2025/04/-1-.JPG 1426w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stopped training completely and focused on recovery, trying "everything – new medicine, consultations with specialists." His condition improved enough that he took his bike to France and lined up on the morning of the race, having done nothing but rest until that moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the event, after struggling through pain to reach a checkpoint, Aki had to abandon the race. "After 80 kilometres and 2,300 metres climbing, it was my limit, so I quit." Meanwhile, Christine – despite having recently discovered lung metastases and undergoing therapy – continued on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She was behind the time cut at the checkpoint," Aki recalled with emotion. "She didn't get an official finishing time, but she decided to continue the race – and she finished."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He saw in this moment a profound metaphor: "I had a problem with a bone fracture. She had a problem with metastatic breast cancer. Two people who knew each other from seven years ago, both with problems, riding close at that point. I quit because I had to continue my work; I couldn't risk getting worse. But she continued because she needed the confidence to live her life more. One person quit, the other person finished. That's very moving for me. That's why I wrote the book."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="https://escapecollective.com/content/images/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-28-at-2.57.38-PM.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://escapecollective.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-28-at-2.57.38-PM.jpg 600w, https://escapecollective.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-28-at-2.57.38-PM.jpg 1000w, https://escapecollective.com/content/images/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-28-at-2.57.38-PM.jpg 1560w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;Christine O’Connell, founder of One More City.

While work still occupies about 70% of his life, cycling takes 10%, and he dedicates another 20% to writing. The RCC summit inspired not just his cycling renaissance but also a creative awakening – &lt;em&gt;Go Over the Peak&lt;/em&gt; is his fourth book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His first book told the story of a massive COVID outbreak at his clinic and elderly care facility. "Many people died," he said. "We struggled to protect, care for, and cure patients. I also got infected and was in severe condition, hospitalised for three weeks. My father died from COVID." Writing became his way of processing this tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His second book recounted his early career, including his time working alongside Katalin Karikó at the University of Pennsylvania – the scientist who later won a Nobel Prize for her work on mRNA technology that enabled COVID vaccines. "She was Hungarian; I was Japanese. We both didn't speak English well, and we spoke English friendly in the laboratory because we were both foreigners."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His third book is deeply personal, connecting his formative year in Kyoto as a student with his decision to establish his family grave there, creating a link between his past, present, and future. It reflects on how his thinking and feeling style was shaped during his time in Kyoto, and how that continues to influence his life decisions today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trip to Kyoto was a return for him. “Kyoto is special,” he said. “That’s where I started to think deeply. And maybe where everything returns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="legacy-and-looking-forward"&gt;Legacy and looking forward&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 65, Aki is acutely aware of time. "I have only a few years left, maybe cycling for five years, but writing, maybe I can do more. I'm changing my life. I want to leave something behind – for my children, for others."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Go Over the Peak' carries multiple meanings. As Aki explained: "I've already passed the peak of my life, maybe. And Christine, she had many hills for her treatment. She's getting over and over and over every year. She's afraid that every year something will happen again, but she is so positive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That positivity – finding joy in life's challenges rather than surrendering to them – is what changed Aki's life. It's not just about the cycling; it's about discovering that life can begin at 50, and can be as rich and meaningful as you make it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aki's upcoming plans include a trip to the Dolomites this summer and joining the One More City ride next autumn. While he rarely rides with friends at home due to his work schedule, cycling gives him clarity of thought. "Riding in the saddle, I think clearly and get ideas for my novels," he said. "Cycling is good exercise, good thinking time, and makes my body and heart healthy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite his successful medical career and newfound balance, Aki has no plans to retire – Japanese doctors typically work until the end of their lives, he explained. What he has found instead is a way to live more fully while still fulfilling his responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel better than most 65-year-olds," he said with a smile. Looking at him and riding with him, it's hard to disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Aki, I found much more than just an interesting story. I found a testament to the power of community, the importance of balance, and a reminder that it's never too late to rediscover what makes life meaningful.

Summers can be hot and humid, while winters are chilly but manageable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to stay:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central Kyoto (near Kawaramachi or Gion) offers easy access to restaurants, temples, and cycling routes. For quieter surroundings, stay near Arashiyama or the northern outskirts, where scenic rides begin just outside your door. We stayed at &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dusit.com/dusitthani-kyoto/?ref=escapecollective.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Dusit Thani Kyoto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; which was absolutely beautiful and fairly central. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Must eat:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try Kyoto’s signature dishes like yudofu (tofu hot pot), kaiseki (traditional multi-course meal), and matcha sweets. Don't miss Nishiki Market for street food or a riverside drinks and dinner along the Kamo River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Riding etiquette:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ride on the left-hand side of the road. The law says that you need to ride single file, and common etiquette is that groups should be no more than 10 riders large. Drivers are typically good, but sometimes not overly aware of riders on the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to pack:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring and autumn can go from cold to warm throughout the day, so layer appropriately and it's always best to bring a good rain jacket with you. Bike shops are plentiful and so are convenience stores (which are surprising excellent for a proper meal) so no need to bring anything special. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural tips:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Punctuality and politeness are highly valued. Bow slightly when greeting or thanking someone. Always remove shoes when entering traditional inns or temples. Learning a few key Japanese phrases will open doors as English is sometimes more rare than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Routes to ride around Kyoto:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;There appeared to be endless riding options around Kyoto, but to get you started here are three of the days we rode which were spectacular:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/14135539210?ref=escapecollective.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Day 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; | &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/14143230960?ref=escapecollective.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Day 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; | &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/14151505108?ref=escapecollective.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Day 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-grey"&gt;&lt;p class="kg-callout-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;em class="italic"&gt;Disclosure: Thank you to Rapha who paid for travel, accomodation, and meals to make my trip to Kyoto possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Scientists looking to tackle our ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-isn-t-just-one-obesity-gene-linked-to-being-overweight"&gt;obesity crisis&lt;/a&gt; have made an important discovery: Intermittent calorie restriction leads to significant changes both in the gut and the brain, which may open up new options for maintaining a healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from China studied 25 volunteers classed as obese over a period of 62 days, during which they took part in an intermittent energy restriction (IER) program – a regime that involves careful control of calorie intake and relative &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/is-intermittent-fasting-or-calorie-counting-better-for-weight-loss-new-study-weighs-in"&gt;fasting on some days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only did the participants in the study lose weight – 7.6 kilograms (16.8 pounds) or 7.8 percent of their body weight on average – there was also evidence of shifts in the activity of obesity-related regions of the brain, and in the make-up of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-contain-a-variety-of-microbiomes-heres-a-look-at-a-few-of-the-most-important"&gt;gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Here we show that an IER diet changes the human brain-gut-microbiome axis," &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2023/12/20/frontiers-cellular-infection-microbiology-weight-loss-changes-microbiome-brain-coupled"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; health researcher Qiang Zeng from the Second Medical Center and National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Diseases in China when the results were published in December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The observed changes in the gut microbiome and in the activity in addiction-related brain regions during and after weight loss are highly dynamic and coupled over time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144243" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144243" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/IntermittentFastingConceptFoodOnPlate642.jpg" alt="Food on a wooden plate in one section with cutlery placed to like hands on a clock" class="size-full wp-image-144243" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/IntermittentFastingConceptFoodOnPlate642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/IntermittentFastingConceptFoodOnPlate642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/IntermittentFastingConceptFoodOnPlate642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144243" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;An IER diet involves careful control of calorie intake and relative fasting on some days. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFjkkQB-bU/"&gt;vetrestudio/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not clear what causes these changes, or whether the gut is influencing the brain or vice versa. However, we do know that the gut and the brain are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-study-pinpoints-specific-gut-bacteria-linked-to-alzheimers"&gt;closely linked&lt;/a&gt;, so treating certain regions of the brain could be a way to control food intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes in brain activity, spotted via &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging"&gt;functional magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; (fMRI) scans, were in regions known to be important in the regulation of appetite and addiction – including the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_part_of_inferior_frontal_gyrus"&gt;inferior frontal orbital gyrus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, the gut microbiome changes, analyzed via stool samples and blood measurements, were linked to particular brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the bacteria &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprococcus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coprococcus comes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobutyricum_hallii"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eubacterium hallii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were negatively associated with activity in the left inferior frontal orbital gyrus, an area involved in executive function, including our willpower when it comes to food intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The gut microbiome is thought to communicate with the brain in a complex, two-directional way," &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2023/12/20/frontiers-cellular-infection-microbiology-weight-loss-changes-microbiome-brain-coupled"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; medical scientist Xiaoning Wang from the State Clinic Center for Geriatrics in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The microbiome produces neurotransmitters and neurotoxins which access the brain through nerves and the blood circulation. In return the brain controls eating behavior, while nutrients from our diet change the composition of the gut microbiome."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144241" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144241" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ChildEatingWatermelon642-1.jpg" alt="A child eating a slice of watermelon" class="size-full wp-image-144241" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ChildEatingWatermelon642-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ChildEatingWatermelon642-1-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ChildEatingWatermelon642-1-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144241" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Nutrients from our diet change the composition of the gut microbiome. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFHfMD27oY/"&gt;corelens/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/04-03-2022-world-obesity-day-2022-accelerating-action-to-stop-obesity"&gt;More than a billion&lt;/a&gt; people worldwide are estimated to have obesity, which leads to an increased risk for a multitude of different health issues, from  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="159793" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing more about how our brains and guts are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/obesity-can-trigger-lasting-changes-in-the-brains-nutrient-response-study-finds"&gt;dependent on each other&lt;/a&gt; could make a huge difference in effectively preventing and reducing obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The next question to be answered is the precise mechanism by which the gut microbiome and the brain communicate in obese people, including during weight loss," &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2023/12/20/frontiers-cellular-infection-microbiology-weight-loss-changes-microbiome-brain-coupled"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; biomedical scientist Liming Wang from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What specific gut microbiome and brain regions are critical for successful weight loss and maintaining a healthy weight?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2023.1269548/full"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in December 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
