&lt;p&gt;Ars reached out to Google for an explanation, receiving a cryptic and somewhat unsatisfying reply. "Showing accurate information on Maps is a top priority," says a Google spokesperson. "We’re working to fix this technical issue."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we are not aware of other Maps searches that have been similarly affected. Google has yet to respond to further questions on the nature of the apparent glitch, which has wiped out COVID vaccine information in Maps while continuing to return results for other medical services and immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sudden eroding of federal support for routine vaccinations lurks in the background with this bizarre issue. When the Trump administration decided to rename the Gulf of Mexico, Google was widely hectored for &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/bowing-to-trump-google-maps-plans-to-quickly-rename-the-gulf-of-mexico/"&gt;its decision to quickly show&lt;/a&gt; "Gulf of America" on its maps, aligning with the administration's preferred nomenclature. With the ramping up of anti-vaccine actions at the federal level, it is tempting to see a similar, nefarious purpose behind these disappearing results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, we have no evidence that the change in Google's search results was intentional or targeted specifically at COVID immunization—indeed, making that change in such a ham-fisted way would be inadvisable. It does seem like an ill-timed and unusually specific "technical issue," though. If Google provides further details on the missing search results, we'll post an update.&lt;/p&gt;

However, instead of making her value her life and body more, the experience has made her hedonistic!&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="170" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5s53on001x3579jgks1moz@published"&gt;The woman who used to practice yoga, jog, and not keep red meat or chips in the house, is now drinking a glass of wine more nights than not and spending her days off binging shows and movies. Her logic is, she was healthy before and still developed cancer, why not indulge? I’ve shared with her that alcohol is carcinogenic, and studies have shown that healthy diets and exercise make a significant difference in cancer survival, but she keeps saying that it’s her choice. She even kicked me out of her house the last time I was there! I have high blood pressure so I can’t eat certain foods, and she has cancer and needs to steer clear of anything that will trigger it. It’s not her fault, but that’s what it is to have a disease. She refuses to discuss any of this, and every conversation ends in a fight now. How do I get through to her that this is not judgement, it’s concern for her very life?&lt;/p&gt;

A GLASS OF WINE “more nights than not” and … chips? And watching Netflix o&lt;em&gt;n her days off&lt;/em&gt;? Like a normal person?? LOL. Mom, please! Simmer down. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5s544300203579kjnth8dy@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lizzie O’Leary&lt;/strong&gt;: Oh heeeeeyyyyy, a moment in which my personal cancer-having expertise is relevant [rolls up sleeves]. Okay, so, when people are lucky enough to survive cancer, they have all sorts of feelings! In the past 18 months since my stage 1 lung cancer surgery, I have been: euphoric, ragey, terrified, exuberant, depressed, desperate to be alone, desperate to be surrounded by people, energized, fatigued, and lots of other things. I have also had to balance &lt;em&gt;other people’s&lt;/em&gt; feelings about my cancer. And that is, pardon me, fucking exhausting. I get that you are operating from a place of love and concern, but unless you are an oncologist, you need to back off, now, or risk seriously damaging your relationship with your daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="28" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5s549m00213579p2yew877@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenée:&lt;/strong&gt; I thought you might have some insight here. I really hate that you had to manage other people’s emotions when you were going through so much yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5s54fz00223579lesbzd8n@published"&gt;Also, one doesn’t have to have had cancer to understand this kind of mom and this kind of fretting. I think it’s fair to say that the Letter Writer is probably what the kids are now calling an “&lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/slang/almond-mom"&gt;Almond Mom&lt;/a&gt;”—someone whose identity is really wrapped up in staying healthy (read: thin) and all that it entails, who thinks three almonds make a totally reasonable snack, and who gets really bent out of shape if other people (especially people who are her daughter!) are not following the same program.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="134" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5s54md0023357918jzgwcl@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lizzie&lt;/strong&gt;: I had not heard of an “Almond Mom” before, but that is quite a coinage. When someone we love gets sick, there is a desire, often unconscious, to make sure we keep the worst at bay. It is natural, it is human, and it also comes very close to blaming a sick person for being sick. You’re not wrong that alcohol is carcinogenic. It is! But there is a fine line between noting that something is a carcinogen and saying it will “trigger” cancer. I say this especially as someone who had a kind of cancer with a huge stigma. You would not believe how many times people asked me if I am a smoker (no, I have a genetic mutation, but even if I had been a pack a day smoker–rude question!).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5s54st00243579wsohu5ew@published"&gt;Nothing makes a cancer patient feel worse than the implication that they are being cavalier with their health. Tell your daughter that you love her, that her cancer scared you, and that your fear about her mortality has made you phrase some things badly. Apologize, then ask her what you can do to support her. I promise this will be vastly more effective than shame and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="26" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5s54yj00253579wcpgfv9q@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenée&lt;/strong&gt;: I can’t believe people asked if you smoked! I mean, I can totally understand if they wondered whether you smoked, but to actually ask? Wow.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="195" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5s555800263579a4h8hvq4@published"&gt;Anyway, that’s great advice that is hard to follow. But I guess I will add one more little thing: LW, you clearly love your daughter. And you clearly have a strong sense that physical health is precious and important, which tells me you’re someone who is in touch with how valuable life is. So I hope you can take all that and expand it a little to embrace the idea that living a good, enjoyable life—not just surviving for a long time—is also valuable! Your daughter is doing things that bring her pleasure. Might they lead to a shorter life than consuming a strict, no alcohol diet and spending every spare minute doing calisthenics and popping supplements instead of watching TV? Sure. However, maybe the goal is not to live as long as humanly possible, but to live a reasonably long time in a way that’s not defined by restriction. And do you know what else is bad for quality of life? Fighting with your mom. So if you really care about her, drop this topic and make sure conflict with you isn’t a part of her last five, 10,15 or 50 years on &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Armed with the patients’ zip codes, the scientists estimated their long-term exposure to PM2.5 pollution, airborne particles that are smaller than 2.5 thousandths of a millimetre. These can be inhaled deep into the lungs and are found in the bloodstream, brain and other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They found that long-term exposure to PM2.5 raised the risk of Lewy body dementia, but had less of an impact on rates of another neurodegenerative brain disease that is not driven by the toxic proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lewy bodies are made from a protein called alpha-synuclein. The protein is crucial for healthy brain functioning, but can misfold in various ways to produce different kinds of harmful Lewy bodies. These can kill nerve cells and cause devastating disease by spreading through the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To see if air pollution could trigger Lewy bodies, the team exposed mice to PM2.5 pollution every other day for 10 months. Some were normal mice, but others were genetically modified to prevent them making alpha-synuclein. The results were striking: in normal mice, nerve cells died off, leading to brain shrinkage and cognitive decline. The genetically modified mice were largely unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Further work in mice showed that PM2.5 pollution drove the formation of aggressive, resilient and toxic clumps of alpha-synuclein clumps that looked very similar to Lewy bodies in humans. Although the work is in mice, the findings are considered compelling evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Putting the two together, to me, indicates that there’s a pretty strong association with air pollution causing Lewy body dementia. We think it’s a very important driving factor for dementia,” said Ted Dawson, a senior author on the study and a professor in neurodegenerative diseases at Johns Hopkins. “There needs to be a concerted effort to keep our air clean.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The work, &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu4132" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in Science&lt;/a&gt;, builds on previous studies that have found PM2.5s in people’s brains where damage has been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/05/toxic-air-pollution-particles-found-in-human-brains-links-alzheimers" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/27/air-pollution-causes-huge-reduction-in-intelligence-study-reveals" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reductions in intelligence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Our findings have profound implications for prevention because they identify air pollution as a modifiable risk factor for Lewy body dementia,” Mao told the Guardian. “By lowering our collective exposure to air pollution, we can potentially reduce the risk of developing these devastating neurodegenerative conditions on a population-wide scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last year, researchers at University College London and the Francis Crick Institute in London &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/20/does-air-pollution-cause-dementia-uk-scientists-launch-study-to-find-out" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;launched a project called Rapid&lt;/a&gt;, for Role of Air Pollution in Dementia, to investigate how the air we breathe may harm the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is an important and compelling study that deepens our understanding of how air pollution can drive neurodegenerative disease,” said Prof Charles Swanton, a co-leader of the Rapid project and deputy clinical director at the Crick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“By linking fine-particulate matter exposure to the biology of Lewy body dementia, it provides a mechanistic bridge between environmental exposure and disease pathology. More broadly, the work underscores the urgent need to understand and mitigate the impact of air pollution on dementia and disease risk more broadly, given its enormous and growing public health burden.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 18:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxNQmhoU0E2MWNxWTJ6ZjVIeTliY25ONzhpNzktam94aVJHa3o1aU5rRkIyMTZiX2Jsd2xVb3ZmZmdrZXVnbHlJMHRKSVlmdFVOcm9WelYwWmRySDBaMVdsekE5b09GT3VEUWlBNVBiNkg3TVNiY0FJYk55ZnkzTnlRb29FWTZBd1VJbkNuS09zaTYycnpoRkJGNG9DOGMxanR6SVVNaTJkS0RpSS1qYjAzQzdSN3Q2VmRHRVh6ZUxn</guid></item><item><title>美国心脏协会发布血压指南改革...对您意味着什么-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15066223/American-Heart-Association-issues-overhaul-blood-pressure-guidelines-means-YOU.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New blood pressure guidelines have been introduced to encourage people to take action earlier on as more young people are being struck by heart issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the widespread belief that hypertension or high blood pressure is an old-age problem, doctors are increasingly treating younger generations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is now estimated that about 25 percent of young adults (aged 18 to 39) have hypertension, a reading of anything higher than 130/80 mm Hg, and a notable percentage of children and adolescents (aged eight to 19) are also affected. Meanwhile, half of US adults suffer from high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This condition can lead to serious health complications later in life, such as heart disease and stroke, as well as kidney disease, cognitive decline and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Under the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/new-high-blood-pressure-guideline-emphasizes-prevention-early-treatment-to-reduce-cvd-risk"&gt;American Heart Association's&lt;/a&gt; guidelines, which have been revamped for the first time since 2017, there is a greater emphasis on preventative measures to 'address the growing burden of morbidity and mortality attributable to high blood pressure.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heart specialists have established a tool called PREVENT: Predicting Risk of cardiovascular disease events. It is a calculator to estimate 10- and 30-year cardiovascular disease risk in people aged 30 to 79 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It includes variables such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels and other health indicators, including zip code as a proxy for social drivers of health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The measures also provide updated guidance on medication options, including using GLP-1 medications for some patients with high blood pressure who are overweight or obese, and recommendations for managing hypertension, before, during and after pregnancy, as the condition can cause life-threatening complications during these periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;New blood pressure guidelines have been introduced to encourage people to take action earlier on as more young people are being struck by heart issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the American Heart Association's PREVENT equation for estimating cardiovascular risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New diet recommendations were also made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it comes to small dietary changes, in adults with or without hypertension, the new guidelines recommend potassium-based salt substitutes over traditional table salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cardiologists note that this can be useful to prevent or treat elevated blood pressure and hypertension, 'particularly for patients in whom salt intake is related mostly to food preparation or flavoring at home'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adults are advised to limit their sodium intake to less than 2,300mg per day, moving toward an ideal limit of 1,500mg per day, by checking food labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking at diets as a whole, the heart health experts recommend the DASH diet, which emphasizes reduced sodium intake and a diet high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, and low-fat or nonfat dairy, and includes lean meats and poultry, fish and non-tropical oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, concerning alcohol consumption, the guidelines recommend consuming no alcohol or for those who choose to drink, consuming no more than two drinks per day for men and no more than one drink per day for women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other pointers in the guidelines to prevent the risk of high blood pressure include managing stress with exercise, as well as incorporating stress-reduction techniques like meditation, breathing control or yoga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also advised to maintain a healthy weight, and increase physical activity to at least 75 to 150 minutes each week, including cardio and weight training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Heart specialists have established a PREVENT (Predicting Risk of cardiovascular disease EVENTs) risk calculator to estimate cardiovascular disease risk in people aged 30 to 79 years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the change in hypertension prevalence among all American adults, as well as among men and women from 1999 to 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 CDC report found 47.7 percent of adults 18 and older had hypertension between 2020 and 2023, which is about the same as the prevalence in the CDC's report from 2017-2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, four in 10 adults of that percentage don't know they have the condition, the CDC said, meaning they are not receiving treatment and are therefore at much higher risk of deadly complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High blood pressure is a primary or contributing factor in more than 685,000 deaths each year in the US alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings mean the government is on track to fail in its goal to bring hypertension prevalence down to 41 percent by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prevalence among men remained mostly unchanged from survey-to-survey and women's prevalence dropped by about one percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And between the sexes, the 2024 CDC report showed that men had a higher prevalence than women - 50.8 percent compared to 44.6 percent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People 18 to 39 years old had a prevalence of 23 percent. Prevalence was about 53 percent in people 40 to 59 years old and it was 72 percent in Americans 60 and older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graphs show all cardiovascular disease risk (top), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk (center) and heart failure risk (bottom) for men (right) and women (left) based on how many risk factors, which include blood pressure, medication regimen, smoking status, cholesterol level and diabetes status, a person has&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While prevalence slightly decreased in the older age groups, younger age groups saw a slight rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This slight increase could be a contributing factor to&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13451921/strokes-rate-surge-young-people-cdc.html"&gt; the rise in strokes and cardiac events among young people&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Strokes in Americans under 45 have risen nearly 15 percent since 2011, according to a separate report from the CDC.  The agency partly attributed the rise to an increase in high blood pressure, but also to an increase in nationwide obesity and drug addiction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Cleveland Clinic lists recreational drug use, an unhealthy diet and a sedentary lifestyle a risk factors for hypertension. However, healthy and active people are not immune to hypertension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The newest CDC 2024 report found, among people with hypertension, 59 percent were aware they had the condition and about half were taking medication to lower their blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this varied widely across age groups. Just 27 percent of 18- to 39-year-olds were aware they were suffering from hypertension, compared to the 74 percent of people 60 and older who were aware of their condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of this, treatment also varied. Just 14 percent of younger people were treating their hypertension compared to 69 percent of seniors.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the level of treatment, however, just 21 percent of all people had their blood pressure controlled to a healthy level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2024 CDC report found 47.7 percent of adults 18 and older had hypertension between 2020 and 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows hypertension prevalence in counties across the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There was no significant change in the percent of people who were aware of, in treatment for or in control of their hypertension observed from the 2017-2021 survey and 2021-2023 survey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, hypertension does not cause symptoms, which is why doctors call it a 'silent killer,' according to the Cleveland Clinic, but when blood pressure is higher than 180/120 mmHg - considered a medical emergency called a hypertensive crisis - a person may experience headaches, heart palpitations and nosebleeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the CDC, high blood pressure was the primary contributor to approximately 685,900 deaths in the US in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, high blood pressure can weaken the heart and blood vessels, which can cause cardiovascular disease, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13154677/young-people-having-heart-attacks-lead-seemingly-healthy-lifestyles-suffered-heart-problems.html"&gt;including sudden cardiac arrest&lt;/a&gt;, and increase risk for stroke and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To treat hypertension, doctors will recommend lifestyle changes, such as reaching and remaining at a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, reducing salt intake, limiting alcohol, exercising and making sure to consume enough potassium, a mineral and electrolyte involved in important body processes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

She grew up as the eldest child in an &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/01/i-got-all-of-my-dating-advice-from-my-evangelical-church.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;evangelical Christian family&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; with a mother who was often bed-bound due to health problems and a father who worked long hours outside of the house. Jordan took on child care, laundry, and other parental duties starting at age 7. She also served as her parents’ confidante, constantly kept abreast of their financial and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/couples-therapists.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;marital woes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. By the time she was a teenager, she had &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/adult-friendships-vs-kids.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;lost all interest in ever becoming a parent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. “I’d seen what that responsibility looks like and how it could consume your whole identity,” the 39-year-old says. She envisioned her adult life as child free.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Blake had grown up with a career-driven mom, and hearing about his childhood, Jordan started to envision a different model of motherhood. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Several years later, after copious journaling, reading, therapy sessions, and consultations with friends, Jordan decided she was ready to start trying. “I decided I didn’t want fear to hold me back from something that could open up my life,” she says. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

She and Blake had long been candid about their sexual fantasies about other people, so Jordan said, “What if we actually tried this for real?” Blake was “immediately game,” Jordan remembers. They started seeing other people together — going to sex parties where they’d swing or have a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/how-to-arrange-three-way-with-husband.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;threesome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; with a woman or nonbinary person.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It was really hot and we were both really into it,” Jordan says. “We even framed it as: This is our last hurrah before we have kids. Let’s go wild and crazy.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jbihx000m0ihqkou85dof@published" data-word-count="50"&gt;At first, I thought I liked threesomes with women due to the male gaze; that it was hot to be in a situation with another woman and be observed. But it shifted for me when I realized, &lt;em&gt;I’m interested in women separate and apart from my relationship with my husband&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jdl2u001p3b788hpoo9lw@published" data-word-count="60"&gt;There was one woman in particular I had a strong attraction to. With men, I’d always needed to feel smaller to feel sexy, but with her, I was taller and I was attracted to that dynamic. That was a lightbulb moment. I thought, &lt;em&gt;I would want to hook up with her regardless, not just because we’re in this sexy circumstance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jbihx000o0ihqk3hxdz5u@published" data-word-count="92"&gt;When I told Blake I was bi, I thought I was taking this awareness in one area of my life and integrating it — making it more meaningful and giving it more texture. I thought I was strengthening our relationship by being vulnerable with him. But he was immediately fearful. He even said, “We’re going to get divorced over this.” That was really hard to hear. I felt betrayed. I had tried to be honest, but was met with fear and anger. I left for the weekend to stay with a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jdy8j001x3b78nfblsezv@published" data-word-count="57"&gt;When I came back, we worked it out. He apologized and framed his response as an initial reaction that he wasn’t standing by. He said he was very supportive. So we resumed going to these parties and working through my sexuality as something that was going to be part of our lives that we’d figure out together.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jbihx000q0ihqlf1uncm1@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;About a year after I came out to Blake, I told him I was interested in dating other people — but now without him involved. He said he was as well. So we set boundaries: We could see people multiple times, but it was supposed to be casual — we weren’t supposed to be falling in love with other people or developing emotional attachments.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jeem600243b78oi45ho26@published" data-word-count="82"&gt;On my first date with a woman, Nora, I remember feeling nervous and hyperaware of my body. I felt very locked in with her in terms of our eye contact and easy conversation. I walked her to the train afterwards and I was like, &lt;em&gt;How do I say good-bye? &lt;/em&gt;We had a quick kiss. It was the beginning of the summer. Soon we had that new-relationship energy and I wanted to see her all of the time. I started falling in love.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jeem600253b786ffix028@published" data-word-count="48"&gt;But that fall, Blake and I also started to try to conceive. We thought: &lt;em&gt;We’re both done with grad school, we both have good jobs, and we’re both in our mid-30s. &lt;/em&gt;We also both wanted two kids, so timing-wise, I felt like, &lt;em&gt;I need to get pregnant tomorrow.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jeem600263b78pie2alcf@published" data-word-count="78"&gt;I knew our sex life was in a tricky stage, but we had figured out hard things before. We’d been through moves and a parent’s death and had a good track record of managing all of that. After a few months of failed attempts, I felt my conviction to become a mother intensify. Getting my period made me really sad. I realized there had been an energetic shift within me — I’d moved away from ambivalence about parenthood.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jep5g002j3b78cfdjpf4z@published" data-word-count="55"&gt;I was in a Pilates class when I heard a little voice within me say, “It’s time to go on an adventure.” So on some level I wasn’t surprised when, later that day, I took a pregnancy test and it was positive. I had this sense that &lt;em&gt;This is right where I want to be&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jfj7q003l3b78hxow0tnc@published" data-word-count="29"&gt;Blake was over the moon. He insisted on coming with me to the first appointment to confirm the pregnancy. The doctor said, “Oh, there’s two little people in there.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jfj7q003m3b78ehtisffw@published" data-word-count="67"&gt;I was shocked but also not shocked. One of my big fears around pregnancy had been feeling like I was in &lt;em&gt;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&lt;/em&gt; — the body-horror aspect&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Blake had always joked that he hoped I would get pregnant with twins because he wasn’t sure he’d be able to convince me to get pregnant a second time. So my first reaction was, “You manifested this.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jevvl00303b78wtsu13cb@published" data-word-count="65"&gt;Blake and I closed our relationship during the pregnancy. I had been very honest with Nora that I was going to try to get pregnant in the fall and that Blake wasn’t supportive of how emotional our relationship had become, so she wasn’t surprised when I ended things. I didn’t let myself feel too upset about it. I just put it in the&lt;em&gt; this-is-how-it-was-always-supposed-to-be&lt;/em&gt; box.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jfwl7003v3b78kyrsr55u@published" data-word-count="79"&gt;I had a dream pregnancy. I had a little nausea, but not bad. I got tired more easily, but also had an ideal work-from-home situation, so it wasn’t a problem. And even though the pregnancy was high risk because of the twins and my age, it never felt stressful because I had amazing medical care through my tech job. I’d been worried I was going to feel invaded by the pregnancy, but instead I felt connected to the babies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jfwl7003w3b78ye98y6bl@published" data-word-count="52"&gt;Meanwhile, Blake and I started trying to understand and digest what my relationship with Nora had meant and how we were going to move on and figure out the rules post-pregnancy. He’d told me about a few of the women he’d enjoyed dating, but he hadn’t fallen in love like I had.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jfwl7003x3b78w6mgl05h@published" data-word-count="43"&gt;I also wasn’t feeling very sexual, so sex wasn’t an aspect of our relationship at that point. We thought, &lt;em&gt;Let’s just focus on the pregnancy and the nesting and the excitement.&lt;/em&gt; Our relationship was good, but there was an elephant in the room.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jg58800443b78phqz6144@published" data-word-count="105"&gt;During a doctor’s appointment at 34 weeks, the doctors found that one of the twins wasn’t growing anymore, and sent me to the hospital to receive the first of two steroid shots. The next day I returned for the second shot and they found I was showing signs of preeclampsia — and they wouldn’t let me go home. So all of a sudden it was like, “You’re having the babies tomorrow.” When Blake and I woke up the next morning in my hospital room (he slept on a pull-out chair bed), we sang to the babies together so they could hear our voices. It was sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jgbkv004b3b78pca5hot2@published" data-word-count="155"&gt;The doctor pronounced my C-section “textbook.” Giving birth was very surreal. Everything was super-smooth and the babies were healthy but very small, so they were whisked away immediately for tests before I could even hold them. An hour or so later, before I’d even had a meal, the clinicians wheeled a breast pump into my hospital room. I felt like, &lt;em&gt;Oh, I’m just a mammal.&lt;/em&gt; I didn’t even get to hold both of them the first night because they needed to be in an incubator. It felt like I wasn’t in charge — it was the NICU nurses who were calling the shots, and I didn’t mind that so much, but in retrospect, I was a little bit sad about it. But I was sad about everything for a while because one baby came home a couple of days before the other baby. When one was in the NICU and one was home, I was just a mess.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jgnvb004o3b78deg7keqp@published" data-word-count="205"&gt;In the initial weeks after they were born, it was all hands on deck — figuring out sleep and feeding schedules and getting help. It was very hard for me to bond with the twins, because I was tied to a very grueling schedule: pumping and then feeding one (with a mix of breast milk and formula, as suggested by our pediatrician) and then feeding the other (with that same mix) and then pumping again. I’d put them down to sleep and start all over. It was a blur and felt very mechanical. Plus, about six weeks into my leave, I got laid off. I had guessed that it was coming — my company had recently been acquired — and in a way, it was a good thing, because I had been itching to leave this job for a while and had only stayed because I had great health insurance. I was worried about finding a new job as a mom, but I’m also accustomed to this kind of thing. I’m an elder millennial who entered the workforce in a recession. And most importantly, I was able to negotiate a good severance package: an additional four months of pay on top of my maternity leave.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jgtet004v3b78m2sxra7t@published" data-word-count="51"&gt;Blake was incredibly supportive through that whole process, encouraging me to find a new job that I’d like better than the old one that I’d outgrown. Our strength as a couple was figuring out all of these logistics. It was easy for us to do that and not really emotionally connect.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jgteu004w3b78w9t0sut5@published" data-word-count="80"&gt;About three months after the twins were born, Blake returned to work and I stopped pumping. That’s when my schedule finally opened up and I was able to spend more relaxed time with the twins. I started taking them on long walks and meeting up with other moms. That felt really good, and it boosted my confidence. I was starting to bond with the twins at that point — just by being able to hold them and snuggle them more.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jgteu004x3b78pymqtiot@published" data-word-count="50"&gt;Blake and I also stayed very focused on seeing friends and family. One of my favorite memories is hosting Thanksgiving that first year with longtime friends. It was the first time we had hosted that holiday rather than being guests. It felt like we were establishing our own family traditions.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jhcwr005a3b784pky0o6u@published" data-word-count="135"&gt;When the twins were 8 or 9 months old, we visited my parents. Blake and I had always agreed that I was never going to come out to my family or his family. He also had a Christian upbringing. But during this particular visit, I was struck by the fact that being closeted with my family meant I couldn’t truly be out to my kids. And if I was closeted to them, what would that mean if they ever wanted to come out themselves? I felt like a hypocrite — hiding myself but expecting my children to be comfortable with whomever they turned out to be. Simultaneously, I had the realization that I couldn’t be honest with Blake about how I was feeling since he’d always been adamant that my sexuality should be a secret.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jhj77005h3b78cakzu1f2@published" data-word-count="43"&gt;I really started feeling this alarm in my head going off all the time. Whenever I had a moment where I wasn’t taking care of my kids or trying to find a job or actively busy, my inner self was a five-alarm fire.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jhj77005i3b78foevjtlm@published" data-word-count="54"&gt;I tried to have conversations with Blake, but he resisted acknowledging that we were in a crisis. After a couple months, I said, “I don’t quite know what to do here. I feel like I have to start to consider divorce.” That got his attention. We both started doing individual therapy and couples therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jhj78005j3b78igq6h751@published" data-word-count="66"&gt;Our biggest issue was my bisexuality: Blake didn’t think it was possible for me to come out to our families without &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; outing us as nonmonogamous. He knew they viewed that as very taboo, and he wasn’t willing to have that confrontation. That felt invalidating to me. Our inability to be vulnerable and emotionally connect in this one area kind of spread throughout the whole relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jhj78005k3b787l826fdv@published" data-word-count="56"&gt;We found we were in a reinforcing loop that locked us into miscommunication and disconnection, and each of our bids to break out of that cycle failed to land with the other person. It was heartbreaking, but we finally decided that we weren’t going to be able to figure it out. We needed to get divorced.&lt;/p&gt;

They didn’t acknowledge the divorce. I felt isolated and unsupported.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jhyox00643b78gmobht1b@published" data-word-count="69"&gt;When I came home, I wrote them an email. I came out to them as bisexual and said I needed a break from talking to them so they could digest the news. Three months later, I got on a video call with my parents and siblings. They said they love me even though they don’t agree with my “lifestyle.” In other words, they still think I’m going to hell.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jhyoy00653b785k6bm0op@published" data-word-count="33"&gt;I told them I couldn’t remain in a relationship with them like that — that’s not my definition of love. Since then, my parents haven’t tried to reach out to me at all.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4ji95g006i3b787251vpc3@published" data-word-count="76"&gt;About three months after deciding to divorce, Blake and I found a second apartment. We started bird-nesting right away, which is a way of co-parenting where the kids stay in the same home all the time and the parents switch back and forth between the two homes they share. It was really disorienting at first. I would jerk awake not sure where I was, thinking I was hearing my kids crying even when they weren’t there.&lt;/p&gt;

But I did reach out to another woman I’d dated around the same time. We are now in an open relationship, and I’m deeply in love with her. I’m not dating other people right now because there’s a lot on my plate, but I don’t necessarily see myself being in a monogamous relationship ever again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jiyiz00733b781sy7l9pi@published" data-word-count="77"&gt;It might sound weird for someone to say they were in their 30s before they realized who they were attracted to. I had always had these emotionally rich, intimate relationships with women. And I also always thought that everyone just acknowledged that women were more beautiful than men. In retrospect, maybe I should have put those two pieces together earlier. But because of how I was raised and how early I got together with Blake, I didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

I haven’t introduced them to my girlfriend, who I’ve been with for a little over a year, because I want to take things slow on that front.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jjj5e007v3b78d0gf29mk@published" data-word-count="84"&gt;I’m proud of Blake and me. It hasn’t always been easy, but we’ve put our ability to handle difficult situations and be on the same team to use. Our bird-nesting arrangement is still going strong. We’re embedded in each other’s day-to-day lives in terms of groceries and laundry and rent pay. Our custody is 50-50 too. He is a wonderful dad and a really good co-parent, even though we parent differently. I really hope he’s happy romantically, but he keeps that information to himself.&lt;/p&gt;

I was &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/the-evangelical-obsession-with-corporal-punishment.html"&gt;spanked regularly as a child&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m definitely not doing any physical correction with my kids.&lt;/p&gt;

When I was growing up, I felt I couldn’t reveal anything I was struggling with. And when I did, it became a running joke in the family. I got a lot of messages very early on that my emotional interior state was not something that there was space for. So I’m really trying to give space for what my kids feel. Toddlers have a lot of big feelings. My mantra with them is: Be brave, be curious, and be kind. When I see that behavior in them, I try to point it out.&lt;/p&gt;

I want them to know they can be exactly who they are. I also have gratitude for them. Coming out to my family was something I did for my kids — I never would have done it for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

But it’s surprising and humbling how much you can communicate with a little nonverbal creature. The bond that I was afraid wouldn’t develop actually did without me having to force it.&lt;/p&gt;

And nearly 18million use it daily or near daily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But because marijuana boosts levels of certain enzymes in the liver, those who take the drug regularly may also break down anesthetics, both the kind used for sedation during medical treatments and over-the-counter painkillers, much faster, making them less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marijuana also interferes with the same system in the brain as anesthetics, which can also make the sedation-inducing drugs less effective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because the drugs are less effective, people could wake up during surgery, which poses dangers because it could prompt muscles to move suddenly, increasing the risk of injury, and cause psychological distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies suggest marijuana users may need up to 10 times more anesthetics than people who do not take the drug in order to ensure that their anesthetics are effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above picture shows a woman receiving anesthetic in a hospital (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors urge patients to alert their physicians whether they smoke, vape, or consume marijuana as edibles, since all can affect their response to anesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who have previously woken up during surgery have described it as 'terrifying' and causing them significant distress from seeing their body cut open, leading to regular nightmares and post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But patients do not experience pain, reports suggest, with their nerves still remaining numbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sood shared the advice online in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@doctorsood/video/7543620531510054157"&gt;clip on TikTok&lt;/a&gt; that has gone viral and received 2.1million views and more than 185,000 likes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It showed the Maryland physician with the phrase across the top of the video: 'Did you know if you do cannabis long-term you will require a higher dose of anesthesia to achieve the same effect?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Make sure you tell your anesthesiologist if you smoke or consume cannabis.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients were quick to respond to the post, with many praising the doctor for raising awareness and some self-described marijuana smokers saying they had woken up during surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One patient wrote, 'Yup, woke up during my colonoscopy [due to this]. Horrible feeling.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors said edibles posed the greatest risk to patients because their effects are longer lasting (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Several also said they had woken up during wisdom teeth removals, which they thought was due to their cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some patients also said they had told their doctor about their marijuana use but had been told 'not to worry'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One wrote: 'I told them that before surgery and they said that's not real', while a second said, 'I&lt;span&gt; asked my anesthesiologist before my surgery. He told me I watch too much TV and to not be worried'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Kunal Sood, pictured, raised awareness over the complication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies suggest that edibles have the greatest effect on anesthetics because these are longer-lasting and can be released from the intestines for hours after consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The effect of marijuana that is smoked or vaped typically lasts just one to three hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients are also advised to tell doctors the strength of the marijuana's THC, the ingredient in the drug that produces the high. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physicians will not judge patients for cannabis use, the society said, and will not share the information outside of their medical team. It will only be used to ensure a patient receives the right amount of anesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alerting doctors to this would ensure patients avoid unintended hospital admissions after surgery, longer hospital stays or readmissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is not clear how many patients wake up during surgery in the US due to marijuana, but it may be in the thousands, with between 40 and 50million surgeries completed in the country every year. And 17.7million Americans describe themselves as habitual pot users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.asahq.org/about-asa/newsroom/news-releases/2020/10/cannabis-and-postoperative-pain"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; suggested that people who used marijuana before surgery required 50 percent more anesthetic than those who did not use the drug.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.uchealth.org/today/marijuana-and-anesthesia-why-tell-your-doctor-about-your-use/"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt; have even suggested marijuana users may need up to 10 times more anesthetics than other patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows how cannabis use has risen among 19-to-30-year-olds and older adults as more states have legalized the drug&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Jiff Zafar, an anesthesiologist at Yale, said previously on the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/what-to-tell-your-anesthesiologist-before-surgery"&gt;Yale University website&lt;/a&gt;: 'We want patients to tell us what form of marijuana, and how much, they are using, so we can understand the potency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'This is important because it can affect how well the anesthesia works. You may actually have more of a tolerance to anesthesia, which means you need more of it.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The American Society of Anesthesiologists tells people to avoid marijuana from midnight the day before surgery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They warn the drug can raise heart rate and blood pressure, putting further strain onto the cardiovascular system alongside anesthetics that can cause a surgery-related heart attack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After surgery, the experts also recommended that people avoid the drug to ensure they recover correctly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

'The tumours grew much bigger and metastasized throughout the body.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But interestingly in mice with no immune system, the carcinogen did not affect tumour growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From here, the researchers concluded that the carcinogen was working within the immune system to boost tumour growth &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They discovered that a type of immune cell, called T-regulatory cells, or Tregs, was key to the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These cells were found to both produce IL22 and suppress the body's natural ability to fight tumours. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pancreatic cancer remains one of the least survivable forms of the disease and worryingly its on the rise. Source for data: Cancer Research UK &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prof Frankel described this as a 'two-pronged attack'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When we eliminated all the Treg cells from these mice, we reversed the entire ability of the cigarette chemical to let the tumour grow,' he explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers confirmed their results in human cells, some of which were taken from patients with pancreatic cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unsurprisingly, they found that smokers with the disease had more Treg cells than non-smokers—as a result of the toxin increasing the number of IL22 proteins in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers were further able to show that an inhibitor that blocks the harmful chemical found in cigarettes was effective at shrinking tumours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prof Frankel said: 'If we are able to inhibit the super suppressive cells, we might also unlock natural anti-tumour immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This could be further activated by current immunotherapies, which do not work well in pancreatic cancer because of the immunosuppressive environment,' he added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst more research is needed to better understand the potential use of inhibitors that block this environmental toxin, the findings reveal a novel approach to treating pancreatic cancer patients with a history of smoking. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If pancreatic cancer is spotted early, before it spreads throughout the body, about half of patients will survive at least a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But if cancer has already spread beyond the organ—as happens for the majority of patients— only one in 10 patients will survive a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While pancreatic cancer is most likely to strike people over the age 75—younger groups can also get the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year the Daily Mail highlighted a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13033795/Huge-spike-cancer-sparks-alarm-experts-baffled.html"&gt;'frightening'&lt;/a&gt; explosion of young women developing the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rates of pancreatic cancer have soared by up to 200 per cent in women under the age of 25 since the 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While numbers remain low, oncologists cannot explain the surge in young women, with no such spike noted in men of the same age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, incidences of the disease have increased by around 17 per cent in Britain over the same timespan, with soaring obesity rates and environmental factors suspected to be behind the trend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Potential symptoms of pancreatic cancer include jaundice, where the whites of the eyes and skin turn a yellow hue, alongside itchy skin and darker urine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other possible signs include loss of appetite, unintended &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-4a954220-d24b-11ee-8674-f7e6e497c93a" class=""&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, constipation or bloating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While these symptoms are unlikely to be cancer it is important that they are checked out by a GP early just in case, especially if people have had them for over four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; The pancreas is a tadpole-shaped organ that forms part of the digestive system and also performs a crucial role in hormone regulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is located just behind the stomach and is about 25cm in length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In its digestive role, it helps produce enzymes that help the body break down food into the nutrients it needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Charity, Cancer Research UK, estimates 22 per cent of cases of the disease are caused by smoking and 12 per cent by obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The 59-year-old Melville, New York, resident knew he faced a higher risk of heart disease because of blood pressure that remained high despite medications and a family history of cardiac problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malin thought he’d covered all the bases. But at a visit with his primary care doctor in early 2023, the grandfather of one mentioned a new development — dull, come-and-go pain in his left shoulder and arm when exercising. He soon found himself getting an electrocardiogram (EKG) to gauge his heart’s electrical activity and an exercise stress test with nuclear imaging. &lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Northwell Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Northwell Health&lt;/a&gt; cardiologist Jeffrey Kuvin, M.D., looked at Malin’s risk factors, symptoms and test results and quickly set up a coronary angiogram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A window into a widowmaker&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results made the scope of Malin’s heart problem stunningly clear: He had a 99% blockage of his left anterior descending (LAD) artery. A heart attack originating in the LAD is sometimes called a &lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/widow-maker-heart-attack-treated-with-therox" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:“widowmaker”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;“widowmaker”&lt;/a&gt; because the artery plays such a key role in supplying blood to the heart. The interventional cardiology team fixed the problem on the spot, inserting a mesh stent in Malin’s LAD to prop it open. Six hours later, Malin went home, healthy, grateful and ready to adopt the medications and lifestyle changes his doctors advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve got pictures of my heart that clearly show the before and the after,” says Malin. “It’s very alarming how close I was to a tragedy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He was able to avoid a major — and perhaps life-ending — heart attack,” agrees Dr. Kuvin, senior vice president of cardiology at Northwell Health and co-director of the Sandra Atlas Bass Heart Hospital at North Shore University Hospital. “It speaks to the importance of picking the right test for the right patient at the right time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Communication points the way&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, when it comes to a heart check-up, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all checklist. The most crucial factor is a frank conversation with your care provider. “There are a number of factors that go into choosing the appropriate tests,” explains Dr. Kuvin, who is the health system's Lorinda and Vincent de Roulet Professor of Medicine. “Everyone’s on their own path, and the clinician’s analysis can determine whether certain tests might be helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Difference-making cardiac tests&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what are the tests your doctor might recommend — and how can they help you stay healthy? Here are some examples, and what they can do for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cardiac MRI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might need it:&lt;/strong&gt; To get detailed information about your heart function, including the texture of the heart muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt; You’ll lie on a platform that slides into an MRI machine. Often, dye is injected through an IV to help produce refined images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it shows:&lt;/strong&gt; The size of the heart and its pumping power, damage or scarring from a previous heart attack or disease, heart valve function and other cardiac conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Chest x-ray&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might need it:&lt;/strong&gt; You need a baseline test or you have chest pain and shortness of breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt; While standing, you’ll be positioned between an X-ray machine and a plate that creates an image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it shows:&lt;/strong&gt; “It provides a good view of the entire chest cavity and can give us information about the size of the heart and how it functions in relation to the lungs,” Dr. Kuvin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Coronary angiogram&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might need it:&lt;/strong&gt; You’re having new or worsening symptoms suggestive of heart disease or received abnormal test results that require further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt; A flexible tube called a catheter is inserted into an artery in your wrist or groin and threaded to the coronary arteries in your heart. Dye is injected to make it easier to get a detailed view of blood vessels on an X-ray image called an angiogram. You’ll likely get a light sedative to help you relax. As with Malin, results might lead to the immediate placement of a stent; a short hospital stay may be required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it shows:&lt;/strong&gt; It can detect restricted blood flow to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Coronary calcium scan&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might need it:&lt;/strong&gt; It can show whether there’s hardened plaque in the coronary arteries, which indicates a higher risk of heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt; You’ll lie on a table that slides into a &lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/imaging/services/cardiac-ct" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CT scanner.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CT scanner.&lt;/a&gt; Electrodes on your chest connect to a device that records heart activity and allows images of the coronary arteries to be taken between heartbeats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it shows:&lt;/strong&gt; Levels of calcium-containing plaque in arteries that can restrict blood flow to your heart. Results can determine if you need medication or lifestyle changes to reduce your heart attack risk. The test isn’t appropriate for someone with active heart symptoms, such as chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Coronary CT angiography&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might need it&lt;/strong&gt;: You have symptoms suggesting heart disease or have received abnormal results from other heart tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works&lt;/strong&gt;: You’ll lie on a table that slides into a CT scanner. An IV will inject contrast dye that will help blood vessels show up better on CT images. Chest electrodes will also record heart rate. You might require medication to slow your heartbeat so the images are clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it shows&lt;/strong&gt;: Detailed images of the arteries can detect abnormalities in blood flow, show areas of plaque buildup and pinpoint areas in need of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Echocardiogram&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might need it:&lt;/strong&gt; You have symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest discomfort or palpitations; you had a heart attack; or you may have heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt; An ultrasound probe on your chest will bounce or “echo” sonogram waves off heart structures, showing moving images of heart walls and valves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it shows:&lt;/strong&gt; “It’s a great window into the heart,” Dr. Kuvin says. “We can see how the heart is functioning, including the muscle, valves and surrounding tissue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Electrocardiogram (EKG)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might need it:&lt;/strong&gt; You need a baseline test or you’re having symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness or palpitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt; Electrodes and wire leads will be placed on your chest, arms and legs. The leads are attached to an electrocardiograph machine that records your heart’s electrical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it shows:&lt;/strong&gt; The electric impulses of the heart and whether you’re having abnormal heart rhythms; it can also reveal a history of heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When should you see a cardiologist?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease is the leading cause of death for people across the world. Seeing a cardiologist can make all the difference, but sometimes people don’t realize they should make an appointment, says Dr. Kuvin. ”We have advanced technologies that allow us to diagnose and treat heart conditions and improve and prolong life,” Dr. Kuvin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some reasons to make an appointment with a cardiology provider:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest discomfort (which may include pain in the arm, neck, jaw or back), palpitations or flutters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure or cholesterol that’s not responding to treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise intolerance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prediabetes or diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dizzy spells or fainting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family history of early-onset or major cardiovascular problems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complications during pregnancy, including high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, or preeclampsia or eclampsia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy or other cancer treatments, such as radiation or immunotherapy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease or other systemic inflammatory diseases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular problems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A history of smoking or obesity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A genetic condition known to raise the risk of heart disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/news/insights/heart-checkup-9-tests-that-can-help" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This story;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; was produced by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Northwell Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Northwell Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and reviewed and distributed by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://hubs.la/Q03klgSR0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stacker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stacker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>aol.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 14:00:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiXEFVX3lxTE9Ga2VhaHNLMjJCX2lBLWZCM2ljRDI2anJLZnlOV2RBdUpuWnNCX3pCcVBPeFpETTFsRWF5bkQwTTc0b0FLaUI5Wkctem1RYVZabkFrUGE2aHRCTlN1</guid></item><item><title>家庭建议：我的争吵姻亲不可能在身边。现在他们毁了我女儿的生日派对。-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/advice/2025/09/parenting-advice-bickering-in-laws.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="36" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5ezqqk000i3b79603jydu6@published"&gt;My husband’s parents get along about as well as oil and water, but last weekend their bickering caused a major upset for our 6-year-old daughter “Alicia,” ruining her birthday party at our local kids’ fun center/arcade.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5f82zn000x3b7933ivl7n1@published"&gt;My father-in-law went to get another piece of cake, and my mother-in-law criticized him and made a snide remark about his weight. This ignited an argument that escalated to a shouting match, which culminated in her dumping a cup of soda on his head. They did this right in front of Alicia, her friends, cousins, and no small number of other parents who were there with their own children. The staff ended up asking my in-laws to leave. Alicia was left in tears and asked why her grandparents are always mean to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5ezqsp000j3b795h52u04h@published"&gt;I want to impose a six-month timeout on my in-laws visiting with the condition that they either get into some kind of anger management or from now on they will have to take turns coming over individually. My husband thinks this is too much to ask; he says his parents have “always been like this” and to let it go. I don’t think it’s asking too much to shield my daughter from their dysfunction because two people in their 60s can’t behave like adults for a few hours. This is a perfectly reasonable position, right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5ezqy4000m3b79jhzk90b0@published"&gt;It’s a fact that a solid quarter of the questions this advice column receives wouldn’t need to be asked if people stopped dismissing their spouses’ legitimate concerns and held their own parents accountable for the wild things they’ve done. But it is also true that some people in more volatile families learn to survive or cope by keeping their heads down, and I really do understand that, to a point. While I don’t think you need to just ignore what happened at the Fun Zone, as your husband seems to be suggesting, I read a lot of experience and resignation (and maybe hopelessness) in his comment about how his parents have “always been like this.” He has probably had to let a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of things go just to stay sane and in a relationship with them.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="113" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5ezr02000n3b79dva7l0ju@published"&gt;Your expectations regarding your in-laws’ behavior seem totally reasonable to me. But sometimes there’s a lot of daylight between “reasonable” and “realistic.” Your husband’s parents have been sniping at each other all their lives. And some people are just not going to deal with their anger issues or go to therapy, no matter what you say to them. Some parents also refuse to listen to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; criticism from their own children, even when those children are fully grown and 100 percent correct. I don’t know if your in-laws are reachable on this—they may well be! That would be great. But it is often impossible to get people to change, even when they should.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="124" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5ezr27000o3b79aif5stzr@published"&gt;You and your spouse cannot control how his parents choose to behave. You &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;decide who your family sees and spends time with, and how, and how often. If you personally need a break from your in-laws, that’s fine. If you strongly feel that your child needs to be “shielded” from her grandparents’ terrible behavior, that is also something you and your husband can discuss and figure out how to address. You can’t &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; your in-laws to change, but you can make suggestions (like anger management therapy), attempt to establish some rules for the time they spend with their granddaughter, or even insist on separate visits, as you suggested. The next time they cross a line, you and your family can also just leave.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5ezr3x000p3b79x3rq02dr@published"&gt;I’m not making any excuses for your in-laws’ treatment of each other, which would also drive me up the wall. And I’m not saying that you have to just tolerate their particular brand of dysfunction. But you cannot hope to shield your child from all dysfunctional behavior forever. She’s already seen some things, and she will notice more and more as she gets older.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="113" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5ezr5r000q3b79o72x7o31@published"&gt;Given all that, I think maybe the most important thing you can do, as a parent, is talk with her honestly about what she’s seeing and experiencing. Ask how she feels about what happened at the Fun Zone, or at other times with your family. Don’t pretend like everything is okay, or that certain behaviors are acceptable when they’re not. Make sure your child knows she can always share what she’s thinking or feeling with you. As she gets older, she, too, will have decisions to make about what she thinks is right, what sort of boundaries she needs, and what she’s willing to tolerate for the sake of relationships she cares about.&lt;/p&gt;

This was often painful for me, and I frequently felt like an odd duck. I grew up to be a still introverted but more outgoing adult. I have only a few close friends, but those friendships are rewarding and I’m generally a content person.

&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Sabastian Randall “Bash” Williams, of Wellington, was taken from us tragically on Monday, September 1, 2025 at the age of 19.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Sabastian was born the son of Brett Williams and Crystal Hill on July 11, 2006 in Wichita.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;A charismatic and dedicated soul,  Bash could always be found with a sly grin that was his signature. He lived a life of loyalty, supportiveness, and energy that was as infectious as his smile. Sabastian was a young entrepreneur with an unwavering spirit of determination. He was a supportive friend, a dependable family member, and an individual who radiated respect and trustworthiness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="more-105612"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;His love for cooking was notable, as he harbored dreams of becoming a chef one day. His other passions included music, collecting shoes, and the sanctuary of video games. Bash’s personality was as warm as a Kansas summer; his presence was like a melody that resonated within people’s hearts, leaving an indelible imprint. His love for hoodies was a testament to his laid-back style and a reflection of his easy-going nature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;He will be remembered for his charisma, dedication, loyalty, and the unwavering support he offered to those around him. His memory will live on in the hearts of those he touched, as will his infectious grin and his love for life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Sabastian is survived by his father, Brett Williams; mother, Crystal Hill (John); sister, Chenoa Williams (Hunter); brother, Sullivan Williams; nephew, August Cowherd; and grandparents, Randy Williams (Dianna); and Lisa Moore who will forever cherish their memories with him. His absence will be profoundly felt, yet his spirit will continue to flourish in their hearts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;A viewing for Sabastian will be held on Friday, September 5, 2025, from 1 to 7 p.m., with family present from 5 to 7 p.m. at Cornejo Funeral Home &amp;amp; Crematory, 1030 Mission Road, Wellington, 67152. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

There's also a genetic element, because having one or two copies of the &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; gene significantly increases the chances of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-gene-doesnt-guarantee-dementia-heres-what-you-can-do-to-reduce-risk"&gt;getting the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers investigated the Mediterranean diet in people with specific genetic backgrounds, while also analyzing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"&gt;blood metabolites&lt;/a&gt;: molecules that can act as indicators of how the body is functioning and processing food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173023" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173023" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/StudyDesign.jpg" alt="Study design" class="wp-image-173023 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/StudyDesign.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/StudyDesign-600x359.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173023" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The study combined data on diet, cognition, and genetics.

This could give us a greater understanding of how Alzheimer's risk factors influence each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings suggest that dietary strategies, specifically the Mediterranean diet, could help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and stave off dementia by broadly influencing key metabolic pathways," &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/mediterranean-diet-offsets-genetic-risk-for-dementia-study-finds/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Liu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This recommendation applies broadly, but it may be even more important for individuals at a higher genetic risk, such as those carrying two copies of the &lt;em&gt;APOE4&lt;/em&gt; genetic variant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the association is significant, the findings are based on well-educated individuals of European ancestry, and don't show direct cause and effect, suggesting there may be unknown factors having an impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the metabolite markers were only measured once, so the researchers don't have a full picture of how diet or the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dementia-in-younger-people-is-often-overlooked-here-are-5-key-reasons"&gt;symptoms of dementia&lt;/a&gt; might have changed them over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, metabolite markers might be used to evaluate dementia risk and to target specific biological pathways for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In future research, we hope to explore whether targeting specific metabolites through diet or other interventions could provide a more personalized approach to reducing dementia risk," &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/mediterranean-diet-offsets-genetic-risk-for-dementia-study-finds/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Liu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03891-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;In a small 2025 study published in the journal Biomolecules, 37 healthy people consumed 37 milliliters of extra virgin olive oil a day for 100 days. Blood and fecal tests showed that multiple markers of inflammation had decreased compared with pre-study levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="28e1f724-05ec-46e0-9efe-3ed7509eec91" data-toc-id="28e1f724-05ec-46e0-9efe-3ed7509eec91"&gt;Kefir or live yogurt&lt;/h2&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A healthy gut microbiome containing "good" microbes is thought to lower markers of inflammation, according to a 2020 review published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/5-fermented-foods-ex-noma-chef-has-in-fridge-2024-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Fermented foods&lt;/a&gt; such as kefir and live yogurts typically contain prebiotics — fiber that promotes "good" bacteria — and probiotics — or gut-friendly bugs — which make the gut microbiome more diverse and release helpful molecules. Buckley usually has one of the two for breakfast with some oats, milled chia seeds, and frozen berries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some emerging evidence that fermented foods may reduce inflammation, too, Buckley said. A 2021 study published in the journal Nutrients found that of the 1,753 people involved, those who ate yogurt had lower levels of two markers of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1b7d130c-4949-47da-b02f-bcd00f93dc11" data-toc-id="1b7d130c-4949-47da-b02f-bcd00f93dc11"&gt;Oily fish&lt;/h2&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Foods containing omega-3 fatty acids — such as oily fish like salmon, sardines, and trout — have anti-inflammatory properties, Buckley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 rich foods are thought to lower the risk of heart disease, which is partly why the American Heart Association recommends eating fish (particularly the oily kind) twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests it could decrease the risk of abnormal heart rhythms that can lead to sudden death, lower triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood, and slow the growth of fatty deposits that clog arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckley likes to grill hers, season it with lots of extra virgin olive oil, lemon, and fresh herbs, which she keeps in the freezer, and pair it with a salad and rice or potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;It's no secret that excessive alcohol consumption &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alcohol-related-liver-deaths-have-increased-sharply-and-it-s-not-the-age-group-you-think"&gt;damages the liver&lt;/a&gt;, but a new study reveals a previously unknown vicious cycle that makes that damage worse. Chronic alcohol use makes it easier for bacteria to leak out of the gut and migrate to the liver, causing further harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study, led by scientists at the University of California San Diego, examined human liver biopsies as well as mouse models of alcohol-associated liver disease. The team &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/alcohol-opens-the-floodgates-for-bad-bacteria"&gt;found that&lt;/a&gt; chronic alcohol use impaired the production of a cellular signaling protein called mAChR4 in the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower levels of this protein were found to interfere with the formation of what are called goblet cell-associated antigen passages (GAPs). These specialized structures play a key role in teaching the immune system to respond to microbes, particularly those that escape the gut into other parts of the body, where they don't belong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-reveals-what-happens-to-your-liver-when-you-quit-alcohol"&gt;Expert Reveals What Happens to Your Liver When You Quit Alcohol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without this layer of protection, gut bacteria could escape and infiltrate organs such as the liver, where they risk exacerbating the damage associated with alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172860" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172860" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Organoid-teaser-1200x628-UCSDHS-642x336.jpg" alt="Alcohol Could Help Gut Bacteria 'Leak' Into Your Liver And Cause Damage" class="wp-image-172860 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Organoid-teaser-1200x628-UCSDHS-642x336.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Organoid-teaser-1200x628-UCSDHS-793x415.jpg 793w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Organoid-teaser-1200x628-UCSDHS-768x402.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Organoid-teaser-1200x628-UCSDHS-600x314.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Organoid-teaser-1200x628-UCSDHS.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172860" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A mouse liver  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-an-organoid" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="106655" data-postid="172857" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;organoid&lt;/a&gt;, used in the new experiments. (UC San Diego Health Sciences)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, though, it's a two-way street. The researchers found that if they restored the function of mAChR4, GAPs would form again, which in turn repaired the immune system's response to wayward gut bacteria, reducing liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could be done either by using drugs to directly activate mAChR4 or by targeting related pathways that end up having the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the most direct health benefits would of course come from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-is-what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-stop-drinking-alcohol"&gt;reducing alcohol intake&lt;/a&gt;, that's not always as simple as it sounds. The team says that targeting mAChR4 could help minimize liver damage in other cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This protein could also play a bigger role in alcohol disorders. While it plays an important role in parts of the brain that regulate habits and addiction, mACHR4 is known to exist in lower levels in the brains of patients with alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugs that boost its levels in the brain are already being tested in &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04659161"&gt;clinical trials for schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, and could eventually be explored as a treatment for alcohol disorders too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09395-z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Samples tested on 3 September at the country’s National Institute of Biomedical Research in the capital Kinshasa confirmed the cause of the outbreak as Ebola Zaire caused by Ebola virus disease.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A national Rapid Response Team joined by World Health Organization (WHO) experts in epidemiology, infection prevention and control, laboratory and case management has been deployed to Kasai Province to rapidly strengthen disease surveillance, treatment and infection prevention and control in health facilities. Provincial risk communication experts have also been deployed to reach communities and help them understand how to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, WHO is delivering two tonnes of supplies including personal protective equipment, mobile laboratory equipment and medical supplies. The area is difficult to reach, taking at least one day of driving from Tshikapa (the provincial capital of Kasai), with few air links.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re acting with determination to rapidly halt the spread of the virus and protect communities,” said Dr Mohamed Janabi, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “Banking on the country’s long-standing expertise in controlling viral disease outbreaks, we’re working closely with the health authorities to quickly scale up key response measures to end the outbreak as soon as possible.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case numbers are likely to increase as the transmission is ongoing. Response teams and local teams will work to find the people who may be infected and need to receive care, to ensure everyone is protected as quickly as possible.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country has a stockpile of treatments, as well as 2000 doses of the Ervebo Ebola vaccine, effective to protect against this type of Ebola, already prepositioned in Kinshasa that will be quickly moved to Kasai to vaccinate contacts and frontline health workers.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Democratic Republic of the Congo’s last outbreak of Ebola virus disease affected the north-western Equateur province in April 2022. It was brought under control in under three months thanks to the robust efforts of the health authorities. In Kasai province, previous outbreaks of Ebola virus disease were reported in 2007 and 2008. In the country overall, there have been 15 outbreaks since the disease was first identified in 1976.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ebola virus disease is a rare but severe, often fatal illness in humans. It is transmitted to people through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as fruit bats (thought to be the natural hosts). Human-to-human transmission is through direct contact with blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola, objects that have been contaminated with body fluids from a person sick with Ebola or the body of a person who died from Ebola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It feels like somebody took gasoline, poured it on my leg, and lit my leg on fire," Gallagher, who has had to have multiple surgeries, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Florida mom was warned by doctors that she might die or lose her leg after contracting a flesh-eating bacteria following a swim near a local beach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 27, Genevieve Gallagher, 49, of Pensacola, went for a swim with her 7-year-old daughter, Mila, in Santa Rosa Sound off Pensacola Beach, per the &lt;a href="https://eu.pnj.com/story/news/local/escambia-county/2025/09/03/vibro-bacteria-on-pensacola-beach-threatens-life-of-woman-after-swim/85830159007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pensacola News Journal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pensacola News Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallagher and her husband, Dana, had gone boating behind the Pensacola Beach Boardwalk, before she and her daughter decided to go for a dip near Quietwater Beach, the outlet noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three days later, on July 30, Gallagher started to experience symptoms of an infection, including sweats. Her leg also swelled and bubbled with blisters, so she was rushed into surgery that afternoon, and she learned she'd contracted the flesh-eating bacteria known as Vibrio vulnificus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallagher believes she caught the infection through a small cut on her left leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24884-vibrio-vulnificus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, "Vibrio vulnificus is a type of bacteria that can cause a fatal infection. You get it from eating uncooked or undercooked shellfish or when seawater enters a wound."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Symptoms get worse quickly. They include fever, low blood pressure and painful blisters," the site adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallagher, who has been undergoing treatment at UF Health Shands Hospital in Gainesville, had to have most of the tissue on her left leg below the knee removed to try and stop the bacteria from spreading, the&lt;em&gt; Pensacola News Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Vibrio cholerae bacteria&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I thought I had an infection, but never did I think I had a flesh-eating bacterium,” she told the paper. “[There are] no antibiotics that they can give you to stop it. They just have to get out any infected skin and tissue. They’ve got to get it off your body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallagher was intubated for nearly a week after going into septic shock amid the infection. Medical staff repeatedly scrubbed and cleaned out her leg in an attempt to remove any dying tissue. Doctors ended up warning the family that Gallagher might lose her leg or even her life to the illness, the paper noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They were finally able to get me stable enough to wake me up, thank God,” Gallagher told the outlet, adding of her daughter, “Mila saw me in the hospital and said, ‘I wish this happened to me and not you,’ and I started crying. That broke my heart."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was like ‘Mila, no, I'm so glad it didn't happen to you. Your little body could not have taken all this that's going on,’” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallagher, who has had multiple surgeries, shared, “Just looking at my leg, it doesn't even look like my leg anymore. It looks deformed right now. The pain is unbelievable. It feels like somebody took gasoline, poured it on my leg, and lit my leg on fire.

She insisted that if she'd known the risks, she would never have entered the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it's so hot and that water is not moving, that bacteria is just growing and growing and growing,” she told the newspaper. “There are no signs out there saying, ‘Hey, this water has a high infection rate for vibrio,’ or, ‘Hey, this water tested positive,’ like they do in Panama City, because I'm sure if they did, people would not be swimming over there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UF Health and Escambia County Commissioner Ashlee Hofberger, who represents Pensacola Beach, didn't immediately respond when contacted by PEOPLE for comment.

Instead doctors concluded it was ‘probably constipation’ and gave her an enema and intravenous paracetamol. But it wasn’t an isolated incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Louise had been struggling with a range of unexplained gut symptoms, including diarrhoea, bloating and difficulties swallowing dry food for more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I could go three days without a bowel movement and then have explosive diarrhoea,’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I also had painful bloating, which made me feel heavy and weepy. I thought it was strange to suddenly start having these symptoms in my late-50s.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet neither a gastroscopy (where a camera is passed down the throat to inspect the gullet and stomach) nor a colonoscopy (where a similar device is passed via the anus to inspect the bowel) revealed anything wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also began to suffer with other new – apparently unrelated – symptoms: dry eyes, dry mouth, vaginal dryness, jaw pain and dental problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After four years of mystifying symptoms, Louise Mountford was diagnosed with Sjögren’s disease, a little-known but relatively common condition where the immune system attacks any tissues that produce moisture in the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I also had no tears and couldn’t cry,’ says Louise. ‘I couldn’t eat crackers or any meat unless it was covered in a sauce as my mouth was so dry I couldn’t swallow.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The day she was rushed to hospital she’d been doubled up on the floor, rocking back and forth on her bedroom floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recalls: ‘The pain had been building up all day from 3pm when I was in a meeting. By 10pm I’d taken the maximum dose of paracetamol, and yet the pain was relentless. I’d never known anything like it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet all standard hospital tests that day came back negative, again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By now frustrated and feeling desperate, she consulted a private gastroenterologist, who ordered a gut transit test – which involved swallowing a pill containing a tiny camera that travelled through her gut, recording images. But again nothing was found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the specialist also ordered blood tests to check for antibodies associated with autoimmune diseases – and this proved to be a breakthrough after four years of mystifying symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Louise was found to have antibodies called anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La – both are associated with Sjögren’s disease, a little-known but relatively common condition where the immune system attacks any tissues that produce moisture in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It explained the odd mix of symptoms that had plagued Louise for four years – she saw a rheumatologist privately a month later who confirmed the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As Professor Simon Bowman, a consultant rheumatologist at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust, told the Daily Mail, Sjögren’s affects secretory glands all over the body, which include secretory glands from the mouth to the anus, in the nasal passages, breathing tubes, lungs, vagina and bowel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Louise’s symptoms included dry eyes, dry mouth, vaginal dryness, jaw pain and dental problems. ‘I had no tears and couldn’t cry,’ she says&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of the gut symptoms are related to dryness and research by Limoges University Hospital in France, published in Advances in Rheumatology in 2021, found 95 per cent of the Sjögren’s patients studied had gut symptoms, such as abdominal pain and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sjögren’s used to be considered rare. However, Dr Kelsey Jordan, a consultant rheumatologist at the University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust, says it’s now believed to affect around 1 per cent of the population. But this could be an underestimate – some estimates put the true figure at half a million sufferers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically it’s women aged 40 to 60 who are affected. However, 10 per cent of cases are men and younger people can also develop it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact cause is unclear, but certain genes are implicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But lack of awareness of the condition, coupled with the varied nature of the symptoms, means it can often be overlooked by healthcare professionals, says Dr Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, patients with milder symptoms may never be referred for specialist assessment or else get referred ‘many years after their symptoms first start, meaning they could miss out on treatment for years’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Updated guidelines from the British Society of Rheumatology published in the journal Rheumatology earlier this year [2025] recommend a number of specific tests for Sjögren’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as tests for dry eyes, salivary flow and the Schirmer test, used to measure tear production, these include the anti-Ro antibody blood test, which detects antibodies produced by our immune system to clear bacteria and viruses: in some people antibodies bind to proteins in our own body causing damage to healthy tissue – several of these autoantibodies are seen in Sjögren’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Bowman notes that some people can test negative for antibodies but still have all the symptoms – in which case, doctors can use their clinical judgement to make a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Delayed diagnosis can cause long-term complications. Over time, left untreated, Sjögren’s can damage the kidneys, blood vessels, liver, pancreas, nerves and lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sjögren’s patients also have a four to seven-fold increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of blood cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Bowman says: ‘There is evidence that a high level of Sjögren’s disease activity is linked to a greater risk of developing lymphoma and greater mortality rates – so arguably if there is earlier diagnosis and intervention this risk might be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘In addition, some patients have high levels of fatigue, dryness and other symptoms and so an earlier diagnosis may improve their quality of life.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In recent years there has been greater awareness of Sjögren’s and in the US at a least, the average time it takes to be diagnosed has improved from six years to around three years. according to the Sjögren’s Foundation of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Nevertheless, it is not as well known as other rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus,’ says Professor Bowman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Katherine George, 35, a social media director, was diagnosed with Sjögren’s in 2022 aged 33 – after experiencing digestive and dry eye symptoms since the age of 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It sounds silly but I’ve never been able to eat a dry biscuit, I’ve always had to dunk it in tea to be able to swallow it,’ she says. ‘My mouth and throat has always felt so dry and I would sometimes feel like I was choking just trying to get food down.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Katherine was finally diagnosed after an optician noticed her dry eyes and ordered an antibody test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Six weeks later I found out I had Sjögren’s – I ticked nearly every box when a rheumatologist showed me a long list of symptoms which included digestive problems, dry eyes, dry mouth, vaginal dryness, a persistent cough, mouth ulcers and fatigue,’ says Katherine, who lives in Falmouth, Cornwall, with husband Ross, 35, a heating engineer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Looking back, I’m amazed no doctor ever connected all the different symptoms.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it comes to treatment the new British Society of Rheumatology guidelines recommend preservative-free eyedrops (preservatives can irritate the eyes), using artificial saliva drops for dry mouth and the drug pilocarpine, which stimulates secretion glands, for treating dryness throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug hydroxychloroquine can also be prescribed in more severe cases where previous treatments haven’t worked, as well as newer disease-modifying drugs such as methotrexate, which help by suppressing the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent research suggests there may be other, improved treatments around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clinical trial results announced in August for the drug ianalumab, a monoclonal antibody drug (which targets immune cells called B cells) showed it significantly improved symptoms in Sjögren’s patients. The manufacturer, Novartis, is set to submit the drug for fast-track approval in the US; with a UK approval expected shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Louise was prescribed hydroxychloroquine, but suffered side-effects including severe headaches and nausea and was taken off it. She now uses eye drops, saliva substitutes and vaginal pessaries for dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’ve seen a dietitian and got advice about a healthy diet and now eat lots of greens and drink three litres of water a day to prevent constipation,’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Taking medication for all my Sjögren’s symptoms is time-consuming and like a military operation. I have to spend 20 minutes steaming my eyes and put eyedrops in seven times a day.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s important people know Sjögren’s isn’t just a dry eye or dry mouth disease, greater awareness of the other symptoms could speed up diagnosis.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There isn’t currently a drug available that will treat the underlying cause of Sjögren’s just treatments for individual symptoms – but I’m hopeful because of new research that there will be one soon.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Back in my 20s, 30s, and even 40s, there was less of an emphasis on exercise for lifelong health, and I probably (or, definitely) worked out initially for aesthetic reasons. I always loved group fitness, and in my 20s and 30s, I lived in aerobics classes (even taught them for a few years!) and did plenty of cardio. In my 40s and 50s, I mixed it up with running, cycling classes, tennis, high-impact bootcamps, and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a26346087/what-is-barre/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a26346087/what-is-barre/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="barre" data-node-id="0.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;barre&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="but-by-my-40s-and-50s-the-injuries-started-stacking-up" data-node-id="1" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;But by my 40s and 50s, the injuries started stacking up.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;I unfortunately tore both ACLs—my right knee in my mid-40s and my left in my early 50s—both while playing tennis. I ended up developing osteoarthritis in my left knee, and after a year of rehab from my second ACL surgery, the osteoarthritis progressed so much that I then had to get a knee replacement. Still, I continued exercising as much as possible, and in my late 50s, took up &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64272959/reformer-pilates-vs-mat-pilates/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64272959/reformer-pilates-vs-mat-pilates/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="reformer pilates" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;reformer pilates&lt;/a&gt; classes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="3" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;By the time I hit my 60s, a DEXA scan showed that I had osteopenia (the precursor to osteoporosis), and I was shocked  since I had always been so active. Then, last year at age 62, I underwent a left shoulder replacement, also related to osteoarthritis (and possibly worsened by too much reformer pilates). After both my knee and shoulder replacement surgeries, I was blown away by how much muscle mass I lost almost immediately from having to pause working out—and from getting older. I hated to admit it, but at 60, I began noticing how much harder it was to put muscle back on, even though I had never struggled with it before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;During my time off after my shoulder replacement, I realized that I needed to make some changes to my workout routine, and I was also learning about how important it is to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a61691102/how-much-weight-should-i-lift-2024/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a61691102/how-much-weight-should-i-lift-2024/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="lift heavy weights" data-node-id="5.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;lift heavy weights&lt;/a&gt;, especially while getting older, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a42447798/how-to-build-muscle/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a42447798/how-to-build-muscle/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="to build and maintain muscle" data-node-id="5.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;to build and maintain muscle&lt;/a&gt;. And even though I had exercised  consistently for 40+ years, I had never done pure strength training or just gone to the gym and lifted weights on my own, because I preferred group classes and didn’t really feel great walking into a gym not knowing what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="i-decided-to-fully-pivot-my-workout-habits-and-go-all-in-on-strength-training-in-my-60s" data-node-id="6" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="6.0"&gt;I decided to fully pivot my workout habits and go all in on strength training in my 60s.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;I started lifting heavier than ever and prioritizing protein. I found a personal trainer and started focusing on &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64218684/power-vs-strength-training/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64218684/power-vs-strength-training/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="strength and power training" data-node-id="7.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;strength and power training&lt;/a&gt; to help me stay strong as I age. I began working with my personal trainer, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/riddickfit_blueprint/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/riddickfit_blueprint/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Justin Riddick" data-node-id="7.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="7.3.0"&gt;Justin Riddick&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, about five months ago, when we met at my gym. I decided to start training with him because I needed help strengthening my shoulder after the replacement. Plus, I wanted to work on &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g44302167/best-bodyweight-exercises/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g44302167/best-bodyweight-exercises/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="full-body strength" data-node-id="7.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;full-body strength&lt;/a&gt; by lifting weights, and I wasn’t sure what kind of movements to do on my own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;I’ve already learned so much from him about proper form, and he’s challenged me to lift heavier than I thought I could. We train strength and power in the big muscle groups, like quads, glutes, and back, continue to rehab my shoulder, and do balance, agility, and plyometric work to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62704292/exercise-for-bone-health/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62704292/exercise-for-bone-health/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="improve my bone health" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;improve my bone health&lt;/a&gt;. I know it’s important to train power and agility as I age, so that if I trip, I can more easily catch myself before a fall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="currently-i-train-five-or-six-days-a-week-alternating-the-types-of-workouts-i-do" data-node-id="10" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="10.0"&gt;Currently, I train five or six days a week, alternating the types of workouts I do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="i--to-avoid-overuse-injury-and-so-my-body-doesnt-get-too-accustomed-to-any-specific-exercise" data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;I add variety in order to avoid overuse injuries and so my body doesn’t get too accustomed to any specific exercise.

So I followed doctor's orders, went  to physical therapy, and continued to work out during my recovery the best I could.

Plus, I love snow skiing, but I can’t hit the slopes hard every day during vacations anymore because of my knees. So, I just take a day off in between and sit by the fire reading instead (which is so nice!), and I don’t go as hard on the slopes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-19" data-node-id="31" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-y6m8k e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img draggable="true" alt="dena aloian crews" title="dena aloian crews" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-09-02-at-5-07-59-pm-68b75d6909522.png?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-09-02-at-5-07-59-pm-68b75d6909522.png?resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-09-02-at-5-07-59-pm-68b75d6909522.png?resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-09-02-at-5-07-59-pm-68b75d6909522.png?resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-7lsrpf e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1gh9ql8 e1geg53v2"&gt;Dena Aloian Crews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;When I'm tempted to feel sad or depressed about what I can't do anymore, I try to turn it around and think about how grateful I am for my body and how it's my vehicle for experiencing the world.

Even with all of the exercise I’ve done my entire life, I was still diagnosed with osteopenia, but my goal is to reverse it if possible through my lifestyle and exercise routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-20" data-node-id="37" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-y6m8k e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img draggable="true" alt="dena aloian crews" title="dena aloian crews" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-09-02-at-5-07-55-pm-68b75dc1915e3.png?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-09-02-at-5-07-55-pm-68b75dc1915e3.png?resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-09-02-at-5-07-55-pm-68b75dc1915e3.png?resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-09-02-at-5-07-55-pm-68b75dc1915e3.png?resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-7lsrpf e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1gh9ql8 e1geg53v2"&gt;Dena Aloian Crews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;With that, I have the mindset that exercise isn’t optional—it’s as important to my health as brushing my teeth, sleeping, and eating healthily. And I don’t wait until I &lt;em data-node-id="38.1"&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like working out to do it, because I almost never actually feel like it ahead of time. I’m a big believer in scheduling it just like any other important appointment.

But according to the acid reflux dietician, drinking too much water too quickly, especially at meal times can also exacerbate symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sip slowly—especially during meals. Think gentle hydration, not flooding your stomach,' she advised her followers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Aim to hydrate between meals instead of right before or right after eating,' she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst drinking a glass of water with a meal is unlikely to have a negative impact for most people, it can make acid reflux symptoms worse because it increases the overall volume of the stomach's contents—putting pressure on the valve that stops stomach acid from flowing back up the oesophagus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Kitty Broihier, a registered dietician and mindful eating instructor, drinking water with a big meal can add to stomach distension and a bloated feeling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research shows that gastric distension—often referred to as bloating—increases the amount of stomach acid reaching the esophageal sphincter, and forces acidic stomach juices to come back up, causing a burning sensation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the online publication &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://foodguides.com/blogs/from-the-experts/why-water-might-be-causing-your-heartburn-the-science-behind-it?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;Food Guides&lt;/a&gt;, she warned: 'As good as water is for you, it's apparent that drinking a lot of water at once will make the distention worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The same goes for drinking water during a meal,' she added. 'Don't wait until the evening to compensate for not drinking enough water during the day.' &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;br&gt;It always best to drink room temperature water, Ms Pelletier added, because water at this temperature can be absorbed more easily by the body, and is comfortably consumed without causing thermal shock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you're still dealing with reflux despite doing "everything right", hydration habits might be one of the missing pieces,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors may be able to advise on lifestyle changes or prescribe medication and investigations to combat the problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But left untreated acid reflux can lead to a condition called Barrett's oesophagus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a condition which triggers some of the cells in the oesophagus to grow abnormally—increasing the risk of oesophageal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as doctors warned earlier this year that millions may be hooked on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which reduce the amount of acid in the stomach, limiting the distressing symptoms of heartburn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when patients stop taking the tablets, which include omeprazole and lansoprazole, the reflux returns even worse than before, experts have said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer charity Cancer Research UK (CRUK) estimates between 3 and 13 per cent of Barrett's oesophagus will go on to develop oesophageal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This translate to someone with the condition having an 11-times greater risk of being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer than someone without Barrett's oesophagus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, CRUK estimates about three in five of the near 9,500 cases of oesophageal cancer diagnosed in Britain each year are preventable. By 2040, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15035953/cancer-research-uk-shock-report-risk.html"&gt;experts predict&lt;/a&gt; there will be 147,000 cases of oesophageal cancer in England. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 10:47:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxOanhya0E5ZUNSZXdwUW5DWkg4eHAzc2dFNGdSeDN2LUF0Q1R0ekEwU3djWDdydXptd1VvbzBJcXRFN2xjX3BrZ1pBTndNLUlyeGU5aF9lU2RkT2pOcFBqZGRQMGpPNVZ0SlprS2lMSU5JYjRlVi1GbW1QUGFsOHZxSXozOWdXbVlRVkUySGR3QXh4RUnSAZgBQVVfeXFMTnpmNF9oU3EwWThpUWV2NHF4UXYwOUdiZXJNeEhKWjdUOWVoM2V6UTA4WlNrUC1HRS1PLXU2dHJxREtrUU0xcFlnRWMwUDd1QVVjWFpiT016cjlWbURBT3RjN3dqNHF3R3RZMnlxVHgwQTJSWG02dDZEUnRRTFI1NzNmSy1BbHFMSkpEelFRX094SV9yMFJVdWc</guid></item><item><title>5个令人惊讶的迹象表明您可能正在心脏病发作-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/09/04/heart-attack-symptoms-surprising/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-from-the-source" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KGZEUYDVG5GMXBGMBSAQQQ27OA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One night, Lindsay Shanks sat up from bed and felt a sharp pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="H7UBMEAAMJG6JBIPLXATZVJ534" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It felt like someone stabbed me right between my shoulder blades,” said Shanks, who was 37 at the time. “My hands started tingling, and I got really nauseous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 10:04:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxPZHNLVm1hckljZnJOSmwtV0R0WjhrdnFjeVF2LVR0ZWxvaXhBN2REVEVwb2lYdzNrQk9LejU1QnR5blpUVTZrQlU5RUpqODZvcUl1dzN6WHN1VmRLNUxCd2VMMk9pUHhMR2NlQnlfZE00emVjbUs3LVMxRkhhOUVSU2VJRFhvZFJkUzJmdw</guid></item><item><title>肌酸补充剂是否就是他们想要的一切？ - NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/09/04/nx-s1-5526053/are-creatine-supplements-all-that-theyre-pumped-up-to-be</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Creatine supplements have long been popular among iron-pumping gym bros. But these days, interest in creatine has exploded, as social media influencers tout the benefits of creatine for everything from adding muscle to boosting cognition and even helping to regulate blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's the supplement of the year," wellness influencer Bobby Parrish said in a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT6pYXDyK/" target="_blank"&gt;recent TikTok post&lt;/a&gt;. "Creatine is legit."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's a compound&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-creatine/art-20347591#:~:text=Creatine%20is%20a%20%EE%80%80compound%20that%20comes%20from%20three" target="_blank"&gt; made&lt;/a&gt; from three amino acids that your muscles use as a source of energy. Your body makes some creatine, and it also comes from red meat, chicken or fish.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But can maximizing your creatine with supplements really deliver all the health benefits influencers claim? Here's what the research shows.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The claim&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Creatine supplements can help grow muscle and improve athletic performance. Some claim it could prevent age-related bone and muscle loss, improve brain function when you're sleep deprived and boost cognition in other ways, or even protect against Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The evidence&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Decades &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5469049/#Sec4" target="_blank"&gt;of research&lt;/a&gt; have shown that taking supplements to maximize the amount of creatine stored in muscles can help to add lean muscle mass and improve athletic performance, providing quick bursts of energy to "do a few extra reps on a bench press or finish a little bit stronger in a road race," says &lt;a href="https://exss.unc.edu/faculty-staff/abbie-smith/" target="_blank"&gt;Abbie Smith-Ryan&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of exercise and sports science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And combining creatine with carbohydrates can help &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/" target="_blank"&gt;boost endurance and speed recovery&lt;/a&gt; from a hard workout, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, you could increase your creatine stores by eating more, but "the problem with that is we're talking like 2 pounds of raw beef every day and not many people are willing to do that," says &lt;a href="https://healthsciences.nova.edu/faculty/human-performance/antonio-jose.html" target="_blank"&gt;Jose Antonio&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of exercise and sports science at Nova Southeastern University in Florida. Hence, supplements.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to adding lean muscle mass, Antonio says the evidence for creatine supplements is "overwhelming." They work — but Antonio says there's a big caveat: "You can't just take creatine and then you put on lean mass." In other words, you actually have to work out.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;A review of 35 studies found that when creatine supplements were combined with resistance training, adult men added around &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35986981/" target="_blank"&gt;2 to 3 pounds&lt;/a&gt; of lean body mass. For older people especially — since we tend to lose muscle mass as we age — that could be &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6921011/#:~:text=Collectively%2C%20the%20current%20literature%20allows%20us%20to,to%20prevent%20and%20treat%20frailty%20and%20sarcopenia" target="_blank"&gt;significant&lt;/a&gt;, Smith-Ryan says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's also some newer research suggesting creatine supplements may help with bone health, though that evidence is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S8756328222001442#:~:text=The%20current%20body%20of%20research,no%20exercise%20intervention%20is%20used." target="_blank"&gt;still emerging&lt;/a&gt;, says &lt;a href="https://www.pbrc.edu/news/media/2025/hannah_cabre_qa.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Hannah Cabre&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian, exercise physiologist and postdoctoral fellow at Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana. She notes that exercise in general helps maintain healthy bones.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Any time we're exercising, moving, lifting weights, the muscles are pulling on the bones, which is what actually increases their bone density. So if you're helping the muscle, you're also helping the bone," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As for other potential benefits of creatine supplements — such as helping &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7915263/" target="_blank"&gt;regulate blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; in people with Type 2 diabetes, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11275561/" target="_blank"&gt;improving memory&lt;/a&gt;, helping the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-54249-9" target="_blank"&gt;brain function better when you're sleep deprived&lt;/a&gt; and boosting brain health in other ways? Antonio says the early evidence suggesting those benefits "isn't strong, but it's certainly interesting."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Smith-Ryan agrees. "I would say as a scientist, I would love more data." Still, she says, if you want to try creatine supplements, go for it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Creatine is not going to be the magic bullet," she adds. "But I do think that it's a low-hanging fruit that has minimal side effects."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Antonio notes that vegans and vegetarians are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7246861/" target="_blank"&gt;more likely to see a benefit from creatine supplementation&lt;/a&gt;, because they don't get as much, if any, creatine from their diet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The nuance&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you are taking creatine supplements to boost your performance at the gym or in the sports field, just know the boost might be small. "It's not going to make you necessarily a better baseball player or a better football player. But it will help you train harder," Antonio says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Creatine is considered very safe for adults, though if you have kidney disease, you should talk to your doctor before taking it, says &lt;a href="https://www.challiance.org/doctors/profile?n=7" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Pieter Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who researches supplement safety. He recommends buying supplements that contain creatine monohydrate — the most widely studied form — as the&lt;em&gt; only&lt;/em&gt; ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If someone wants to use supplements, we need to know exactly what ingredient we're getting and exactly the precise dose," Cohen says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He notes that studies have found that products sold as preworkout sports supplements can often be adulterated with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10570429/" target="_blank"&gt;prohibited ingredients&lt;/a&gt;. So he says if you do try a creatine supplement, make sure it's certified by a third-party certification program; he recommends &lt;a href="https://www.nsfsport.com/" target="_blank"&gt;NSF Certified for Sport&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cohen says while creatine supplements might mean the difference between winning and losing for a competitive athlete, "for recreational activities and certainly to stay healthy for the long term, I don't personally think there's a role for creatine that's been proven as of yet."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And not everyone will see a difference in their performance after supplementing with creatine. Cohen points to &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2004/08000/ACUTE_CREATINE_MONOHYDRATE_SUPPLEMENTATION_.39.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;that suggests that, due to individual biological differences, as many as 20% to 30% of people won't respond to creatine supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;If you want to try it&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are two strategies for getting started on creatine supplements for muscle-building benefits. One is what's called a loading dose, says Antonio, which involves taking 5 grams of creatine four times a day for seven days. This will quickly build up creatine stores in muscles, but might cause some gastrointestinal distress.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's why Antonio and Cabre both say they often recommend the second strategy, which is to take 5 grams of creatine daily. It will take longer for the creatine to saturate the muscles, so you need to take this daily dose for at least four and preferably eight weeks before noticing a difference in terms of lean muscle mass, says Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Once someone has been on creatine for a while, 3 to 5 grams a day is generally considered the maintenance dose.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you want to try creatine, but you understand what the potential benefit is — that you might be able to do a heavy, repetitive activity a little faster and you choose to try it for that reason — that's reasonable," Cohen says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we age, what and how much we eat tends to change. However, how meal timing relates to health remains less understood. Researchers at Mass General Brigham and their collaborators studied changes to meal timing in older adults and discovered people experience gradual shifts in when they eat meals as they age.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;They also found characteristics that may contribute to meal timing shifts and revealed specific trajectories linked to an earlier death. The results are published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-01035-x" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Communications Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our research suggests that changes in when older adults eat, especially the timing of breakfast, could serve as an easy-to-monitor marker of their overall health status. Patients and clinicians can possibly use shifts in mealtime routines as an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/early+warning/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;early warning&lt;/a&gt; sign to look into underlying physical and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mental+health+issues/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mental health issues&lt;/a&gt;," said lead author Hassan Dashti, Ph.D., RD, a nutrition scientist and circadian biologist at Massachusetts General Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Also, encouraging older adults to have consistent meal schedules could become part of broader strategies to promote healthy aging and longevity."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dashti and his colleagues—including senior author Altug Didikoglu, MSc, Ph.D., of the Izmir Institute of Technology in Turkey—examined key aspects of meal timing that are significant for aging populations to determine whether certain patterns might signal, or even influence, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+outcomes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health outcomes&lt;/a&gt; later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed data, including &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+samples/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood samples&lt;/a&gt;, from 2,945 community-dwelling adults in the UK aged 42–94 years old who were followed for more than 20 years. They found that as older adults age, they tend to eat breakfast and dinner at later times, while also narrowing the overall time window in which they eat each day.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Later breakfast time was consistently associated with having physical and mental health conditions such as depression, fatigue and oral health problems. Difficulty with meal preparation and worse sleep were also linked with later mealtimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, later breakfast timing was associated with an increased risk of death during follow-up. Individuals genetically predisposed to characteristics associated with being a "night owl" (preferring later sleep and wake times) tended to eat meals at later times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Up until now, we had limited insight into how the timing of meals evolves later in life and how this shift relates to overall health and longevity," said Dashti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings help fill that gap by showing that later meal &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/timing/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;timing&lt;/a&gt;, especially delayed breakfast, is tied to both health challenges and increased mortality risk in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt;. These results add new meaning to the saying that 'breakfast is the most important meal of the day,' especially for older individuals."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dashti noted that this has important implications as time-restricted eating and intermittent fasting gain popularity, where the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+impacts/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health impacts&lt;/a&gt; of shifting meal schedules may differ significantly in aging populations from those in younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Walk into any hospital, nursing home, or senior care facility, and you’ll likely see them: small bottles of meal replacement shakes being handed out to patients as “nutrition support.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-571752 lazyload" data-src="https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0001-300x200.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0001-300x200.jpg 300w, https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0001.jpg 728w" data-sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A closer look at what’s actually in these products reveals a troubling reality: many of these shakes contain ingredients that can worsen the very conditions they’re meant to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Institutional Shake Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a regular occurrence — seniors in hospitals or care facilities being given shakes that are essentially sugar water with a little protein thrown in,” says Joel Bikman, a nutrition expert who’s now dedicated his life to helping others make better lifestyle choices. “These products are handed out because they’re cheap, not because they’re what’s best for patient health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers are staggering. A recent analysis of popular institutional meal replacement shakes found that many contain 15-25 grams of sugar per serving — more than a can of some popular soda pops. For seniors already struggling with diabetes, insulin resistance, or metabolic disorders, this can be particularly harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s Really Inside&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sugar Problem – Many hospital-distributed shakes contain corn syrup, cane sugar, or fructose as primary ingredients. Research published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society found that high-sugar nutritional supplements can actually worsen glucose control in elderly patients, particularly those with existing diabetes or prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-571753 lazyload" data-src="https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0002-300x200.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0002-300x200.jpg 300w, https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0002.jpg 728w" data-sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial Additives – To extend shelf life and reduce costs, institutional shakes often contain artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives. A 2021 study in Clinical Nutrition found that these additives can trigger inflammatory responses — particularly problematic for seniors whose immune systems are already compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor Protein Quality – Many institutional shakes rely on soy protein isolate or other cheap protein sources that don’t provide complete amino acid profiles. For seniors fighting muscle loss (sarcopenia), this inadequate protein can actually accelerate decline rather than prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As you get older, your need for protein to build and maintain needed muscle mass actually increases — up to double the amount currently recommended,” Bikman said. “The majority of aging adults are significantly below those recommended amounts — to their harm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Cost-vs-Health Equation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare institutions face budget pressures that often prioritize cost over nutritional quality. A premium, metabolically balanced shake might cost $3-4 per serving, while institutional options can be purchased for little more than a $1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The irony is that giving patients this very poor-quality nutrition can actually extend hospital stays and worsen outcomes,” explains Bikman. “A patient who experiences blood sugar spikes and crashes simply isn’t going to recover as quickly as someone getting stable, balanced nutrition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Real-World Consequences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact goes beyond individual patient health. A study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that seniors consuming high-sugar nutritional supplements showed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased inflammation markers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poorer glycemic control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher rates of digestive issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduced appetite for actual meals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-571754 lazyload" data-src="https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0003-300x200.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0003-300x200.jpg 300w, https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0003.jpg 728w" data-sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Seniors and Families Can Do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by asking questions, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Can I see the ingredient list of this shake?”&lt;br&gt;
“What’s the sugar content?”&lt;br&gt;
“Are there artificial additives?”&lt;br&gt;
“Are there alternative options?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option is if you need a meal replacement shake, simply bring your own. Many facilities allow patients to bring their own nutritional supplements. Look for shakes with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No added sugars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-quality protein sources (whey, egg, or collagen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal artificial ingredients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balanced macronutrients (roughly equal protein and healthy fats)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Path Forward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some progressive healthcare systems are beginning to recognize this problem. Kaiser Permanente and Mayo Clinic have started evaluating their nutritional supplement choices based on ingredient quality, not just cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We wouldn’t accept substandard medications in hospitals,” notes Bikman. “Why should we accept substandard nutrition?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the overwhelming need for a truly healthy meal replacement shake that folks 60+ could consume each day, Bikman and his team of metabolic and nutrition experts decided to create the ideal solution: &lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/?utm_source=MERIDIAN&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;HLTH Code Complete Meal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Each shake features an optimized, science-backed blend of protein, collagen, healthy fats, apple cider vinegar, probiotics, fiber, vitamins and minerals – with no added sugar or any artificial ingredients,” said Bikman. “For most people, it’s easily the healthiest thing they’ll consume in the day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-571755 lazyload" data-src="https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0004-300x200.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0004-300x200.jpg 300w, https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0004.jpg 728w" data-sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Real Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bikman notes that thousands of people age 60 and over are using HLTH Code every day to look and feel better, and points to a few of their many 5-star reviews:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m so glad to have found this product. Two words IT WORKS. I was recently diagnosed &amp;amp; have had to make major changes to my diet. Have this for breakfast everyday, Low glycemic index, calories to keep you full longer. Works well with losing weight &amp;amp; maintaining glucose levels,” Maria F. wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wear a continuous glucose monitor and can see that my blood glucose is steady-eddy, no spikes when I consume this shake,” Danalee J. said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just what I have been looking for as a well-balanced good tasting meal replacement. Very quick and easy preparation with no clumping in the shake. This is the first shake that keeps me feeling full and sustained throughout my workday,” Gerald B. said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So easy to mix and turn into a meal. Tastes great and nutritionally sound. I could just eat these for my meals and be fine,” Patrick I. stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This product is so good. I love the fact that I get 50% of the vitamins and minerals I need with each serving,” Sharon L. said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Satisfaction Guaranteed&lt;/h3&gt;

These include hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetes, obesity, smoking, physical inactivity, depression, excessive alcohol consumption, hearing loss, and social isolation. Low educational attainment and poor sleep quality are also significant contributors. These factors often coexist and can amplify dementia risk. Managing these through lifestyle changes, such as regular physical activity, healthy diet, quitting smoking, controlling blood pressure and blood sugar, and maintaining social engagement, can reduce or delay dementia onset.

Because of the risks involved, doctors are often cautious about using drugs off-label, but in some circumstances, such as treating a rare disease, their use can offer a meaningful benefit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Jutton’s&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;off-label treatment included significant risks: difficulty breathing, a sudden drop in blood pressure, and significant neurologic toxicity causing confusion and delirium, said&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Roberts. In some patients, the effects&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;of the treatment&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;are severe enough that they end up at the hospital’s intensive care unit. Another doctor knew of a patient who had died from the treatment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Off-label treatments should be pursued with caution, said&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Dr. Sarimar Agosto Salgado, an oncologic endocrinologist at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Fla. Typically, she said, they should only be pursued in academic medical centers that can bring together experts from a variety of relevant fields. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But for many&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;people with rare diseases and limited treatments, a high-risk option can seem worth taking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“When treating this type of cancer, there’s really not much for patients and prognoses are very poor,” said Roberts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

        "&gt;&lt;span class="caption | margin_right_half"&gt;Robb Jutton, 51, at Massachusetts General Hospital on Tuesday, Aug. 19, 2025. The Meredith, N.H., father of two went from needing a wheelchair due to stage 4 thyroid cancer to walking and playing cornhole with his family, thanks to an experimental treatment he's receiving at the Boston hospital.

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit uppercase"&gt;Erin Clark/Globe Staff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;When he met Jutton in April,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Roberts thought of a drug, tarlatamab, that was approved just last year to treat lung cancer. There was scant evidence of its effectiveness treating thyroid cancer, but Roberts thought it might work because of how it binds to a specific kind of protein present in both thyroid cancer and lung cancer. Working with colleagues in other departments, he had tried it off-label with a few of his patients to treat thyroid cancer and had good initial results. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But there were issues with the drug’s toxicity. The adverse effect in one patient led to death, according to Dr. Mimi Hu, professor and deputy department chair of Clinical Affairs and the Department of Endocrine Neoplasia and Hormonal Disorders at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Hu reviewed Roberts’s preliminary findings, which he plans to present at a meeting of the American Thyroid Association in September. Hu said the off-label treatment is&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;promising and worthy of further study.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Our patients deserve us coming to the table and further evaluating this possibility,” she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Roberts said he discussed using tarlatamab with Jutton. He told him that there were no established treatments for his stage of thyroid cancer and explained the risks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“There are a few sort of possibilities, kind of based on a tiny bit of data and a hunch,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For Jutton, that was enough to move forward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We’re so on the cutting edge of what’s going on with medical science that there’s literally no data to rely on,” Jutton said. “They’re kind of using me as a guinea pig to learn how this stuff is working.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Cancer had stolen Jutton’s life. Once a bass player in a heavy metal band, Jutton started feeling extreme fatigue in January 2024. By May 2024 he was diagnosed with medullary thyroid cancer, an extremely rare form of thyroid cancer with only about &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22873-medullary-thyroid-cancer-mtc" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;1,000 diagnoses a year&lt;/a&gt; in the US. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He began conventional treatment in New Hampshire in June 2024, taking an FDA-approved medication, called &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-selpercatinib-medullary-thyroid-cancer-ret-mutation" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;selpercatinib&lt;/a&gt;, that stops cancer from growing by blocking certain proteins. But by December, the cancer was growing quickly again, and Jutton was getting weaker.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It was basically like him just laying in a hospital bed waiting to die,” said his wife, Corrine Jutton.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Jutton was referred to Massachusetts General Hospital for treatment. There, he met Roberts, who gave him the option of trying an experimental treatment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Roberts said when treating a rare cancer, he tries to figure out if it would be possible to repurpose a treatment from a more common cancer, focusing on biology. He thought of tarlatamab for Jutton because it binds to a protein called DLL3 — a protein that is present on both lung cancer cells and thyroid cancer cells. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The treatment is a type of immunotherapy. Y-shaped antibodies bind to the DLL3 protein in the cancer with one “arm” and to a T cell with the other, allowing the T cells to do what they’re supposed to do: kill the cancer cells, Roberts said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It seemed like an encouraging therapeutic option in patients that were out of options,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

He no longer needed the opioids he had previously taken several times a day, his wife said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“From that moment on, he had no more pain, whereas the last year and a half has been a build up of worsening pain,” Corrine Jutton said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He started to regain energy, and now he’s able to once again do activities from the mundane, like mowing the lawn, to the momentous, such as attending his daughter’s high school graduation — a special moment he thought he might not see. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s miraculous, as far as I’m concerned,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Jutton has been able to access the treatment at no cost to his family under a financial assistance program,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;said Roberts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Other doctors who treat medullary thyroid cancer said the tarlatamab treatment has promise, but urged further study to understand and limit the potentially severe side effects. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Hu said Roberts’s results raise questions of whether thyroid patients might need a different dose of tarlatamab than lung cancer patients. She said a study could be designed to expand access to the treatment, and also investigate how patients might respond to it if it’s administered earlier. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Salgado called the innovative approach to advanced thyroid cancer “promising.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Still, she said, more study and data areneeded about the drug’s potential toxicity. Until then, Salgado said she would not recommend the treatment to the general medical community. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I am encouraged of how we can bring promising therapies to patients through collaboration between expert teams, patients, and industry to continue moving forward the field,” she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Jutton does not know how much longer he’ll survive his cancer. He said he plans to keep taking the treatment as long as he can, whether that’s for another 30 years or another two weeks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He hopes his experience can be used to help others. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“If this crappy experience can make anything better for anyone coming behind me, then there’s a silver lining in it, as far as I’m concerned,” said Jutton. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

Propranolol blocks adrenaline’s effects, so those physical symptoms chill out. It kicks in within ~30–60 minutes and lasts a few hours, or up to a week if you're on it regularly. But here’s the catch: it only tames the body’s reaction.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NORFOLK, Va. — A Trantwood Elementary student between the ages of 5 and 12 has contracted measles, the first child in Hampton Roads and the fourth overall case in the state for this year, the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) announced Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VDH said the child recently traveled internationally.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are locations of potential public exposure sites provided by VDH:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul id="isPasted"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children’s Hospital of The King’s Daughters (CHKD) Health Center and Urgent Care at Loehmann’s Plaza&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;3960 Virginia Beach Blvd, Virginia Beach &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong id="isPasted"&gt;Wednesday, August 27, from 5 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CVS Pharmacy&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;300 Laskin Road, Virginia Beach&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong id="isPasted"&gt;Thursday, August 28 from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CHKD Emergency Department/Hospital&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;601 Children’s Lane in Norfolk&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Emergency Department: &lt;strong&gt;Saturday, August 30 from 1:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hospital: &lt;strong&gt;from&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Saturday, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 30 at 6 p.m. to Monday, September 1 at 6 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were at any of the above locations on the specified days and times, here is what VDH says you should do:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you &lt;strong&gt;have &lt;/strong&gt;received two doses of a measles-containing vaccine, or were born before 1957, you are protected and do not need to take any action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you &lt;strong&gt;have never &lt;/strong&gt;received a measles-containing vaccine (either the measles, mumps and rubella [MMR] vaccine or a measles-only vaccine which is available in other countries) &lt;strong&gt;you may be at risk of developing measles. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone who might have been exposed and is at risk of developing measles should contact their healthcare provider promptly to discuss questions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone should watch for measles symptoms for 21 days after the date of your potential exposure&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you notice symptoms of measles, stay home and isolate immediately, and contact your healthcare provider right away.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you need to seek healthcare, call ahead of time before going to the doctor's office or emergency room to notify them you may have been exposed, and ask them to call the local health department. This will help protect other patients and staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those with an immunocompromising condition should contact their healthcare provider if they have questions or if they develop symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have only received &lt;strong&gt;one dose&lt;/strong&gt; of a measles-containing vaccine, you are very likely to be protected and your risk of infection is very low. However, VDH says in order to reach the highest level of protection, you should speak with your doctor about getting a second dose of the vaccine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles appear in two stages, VDH said. The first stage involves a fever of over 101 degrees, a runny nose, watery and red eyes, and a cough, appearing between a week and two weeks of exposure. The second stage occurs between three to five days after symptoms appear, when a rash appears on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with measles are contagious from four days before the rash appears to four days after it appears.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virginia Beach City Public Schools said the child who contracted measles attends Trantwood Elementary. Below was the letter sent to families on Thursday:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trantwood Elementary School families and staff,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are writing to inform you that there was a reported case of measles at Trantwood Elementary School. The known date of onset for the illness was Tuesday, Aug. 26, the second day of school. Please refer to the letter linked here and below from the Virginia Department of Health for more detailed information about the illness and prevention measures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We understand this is a very concerning situation. The health of our students and staff is of the utmost importance to us. Please know we are working very closely with the Virginia Department of Health to address this situation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;School is open under normal operations tomorrow for those who have been vaccinated. Unvaccinated students and staff, including those who have a medical or other exemption to vaccination, must not attend school through Sept. 16, 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson also said the student rides the bus, specifically Bus 21, which serves Trantwood, Linkhorn Park Elementary, and Lynnhaven Middle School.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

					
				&lt;/header&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Under Governor Maura Healey’s direction, the Department of Public Health (DPH) issued a standing order Wednesday to ensure that anyone in Massachusetts over the age of 5 can get a &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/tag/COVID-19-vaccine/"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; booster shot despite federal limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/standing-order-for-dispensing-and-administration-of-covid-19-vaccine-2025-2026"&gt;standing order&lt;/a&gt; authorizes pharmacists in Massachusetts to administer the COVID vaccine to “all eligible persons.” Standing orders for physicians to determine eligibility and record administration of the vaccine can be found on the DPH’s website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/health/2025/08/27/why-getting-a-covid-19-vaccine-is-likely-to-be-more-complicated-this-year/"&gt;So far&lt;/a&gt;, the FDA has only approved the newest round of seasonal COVID vaccines for people aged 65 and older or younger people who have a health condition that makes them more vulnerable to the virus. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/health/2025/05/27/rfk-jr-says-covid-vaccines-no-longer-recommended-for-healthy-children-and-pregnant-women/"&gt;previously announced&lt;/a&gt; in May that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would no longer recommend the vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No matter what happens with Robert Kennedy and the federal government, we are going to make sure vaccines remain available in Massachusetts,” Healey said in a statement Wednesday. “At my direction, our Commissioner of Public Health issued an order on Friday to allow pharmacies to continue to provide COVID vaccines to Massachusetts residents. We are working to ensure that all pharmacies make the vaccine available as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new restrictions are part of a long string of anti-vaccine actions from Kennedy, who fired every member of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices earlier this year. In August, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2025/08/05/kennedy-rfk-jr-pulls-500-million-in-funding-for-vaccine-development/"&gt;pulled $500 million of funding&lt;/a&gt; and canceled 22 projects to develop vaccines using mRNA technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of Kennedy’s movements against the COVID vaccine are already being felt in some states, including Massachusetts. CVS &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/health/2025/08/29/cvs-holds-off-on-offering-covid-vaccines-in-16-states-including-mass/"&gt;confirmed last week&lt;/a&gt; that the pharmacy chain would not be offering the vaccine in 16 states or in the District of Columbia due to “the current regulatory environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of a recommendation from the Advisory Committee has made it drastically more difficult to get a booster shot in some states. As long as the standing order remains in effect, however, pharmacists in Massachusetts will be able to administer the shot without the CDC panel’s approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the order, pharmacists can administer Moderna’s mNEXSPIKE vaccine and Novavax’s Nuvaxovid vaccine for people 12 and older. For children ages 5 through 11, they can administer Moderna’s Spikevax vaccine or Pfizer’s COMIRNATY vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tmz.com/people/bryan-kohberger/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bryan Kohberger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says he was diagnosed with a slew of mental health disorders before he entered his guilty plea ... including autism.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

    &lt;section id="cb-604cf9167e0fcf0ea7087e3f4be27423" class="canvas-block canvas-block-permalink canvas-text-block canvas-text-block-permalink canvas-text-block--default  " data-context='{"section":"permalink","name":"text_block"}'&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The convicted mass killer revealed in a handwritten court filing from June that he had been diagnosed with autism level 1, OCD, ADHD and ARFID, an eating disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

    

    &lt;section id="cb-ff5881ba56667a1487bfef418bb2b464" class="canvas-block canvas-block-permalink canvas-text-block canvas-text-block-permalink canvas-text-block--default  " data-context='{"section":"permalink","name":"text_block"}'&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Kohberger noted all four mental health disorders were diagnosed in February 2025 ... when he was in custody awaiting his murder trial.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;a id="continued" class="continued-anchor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;In the June court filing, obtained by PEOPLE, Kohberger revealed he was taking medication typically prescribed for hypothyroidism.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

    

    &lt;section id="cb-d3d705f98e4240a5a1eb31f571d05515" class="canvas-block canvas-block-permalink canvas-text-block canvas-text-block-permalink canvas-text-block--default  " data-context='{"section":"permalink","name":"text_block"}'&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Kohberger said the mental health disorders and medication would have no effect on understanding the court proceedings or what it meant to plead guilty to a crime.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

    &lt;section id="cb-e2173f0c90c74d97b05d67e13cc1ad99" class="canvas-block canvas-block-permalink canvas-text-block canvas-text-block-permalink canvas-text-block--default  " data-context='{"section":"permalink","name":"text_block"}'&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The filing is reportedly dated June 29 ... only a few days before the July 1 confession Kohberger signed where&lt;a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/06/30/bryan-kohberger-cuts-plea-deal-no-death-penalty/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; he copped to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a heinous killing spree that claimed the lives of&lt;strong&gt; Madison Mogen&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Kaylee Goncalves&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Xana Kernodle&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Ethan Chapin&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Kohberger appeared in court July 2 and &lt;a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/07/02/bryan-kohberger-in-court-for-plea-deal-hearing/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;admitted guilt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the four murders ... and he's now serving life in prison without the possibility of parole.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="260" data-end="303"&gt;Trends have a funny way of circling back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="305" data-end="558"&gt;What your grandparents once did to pass the time is suddenly all over TikTok and Instagram. Some of these hobbies were seen as outdated, maybe even uncool for a while—but now they’re back in the spotlight, rebranded and thriving with a new generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="560" data-end="612"&gt;Let’s dive into seven of the most surprising ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="619" data-end="641"&gt;1. Vinyl collecting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="643" data-end="847"&gt;There was a time when vinyl was considered dead. CDs were the future, then MP3s, then streaming. But here we are again, flipping through records at local shops or digging through crates at flea markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="849" data-end="1041"&gt;For boomers, records were everyday items—just how you listened to music. For Gen Z, it’s about slowing down, owning something tangible, and celebrating music in a way that feels intentional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1043" data-end="1340"&gt;As Jack White once said, “Vinyl is the purest form of music you can get.” It’s less about convenience and more about ritual: sliding the record out, placing it on the turntable, and letting the needle drop. That kind of physical connection with music is something streaming just can’t replicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1342" data-end="1641"&gt;There’s also the social side. Record fairs and independent stores have become gathering places again, not unlike the way boomers once swapped LPs with friends. I’ve been to shows where the merch table includes limited-run vinyl pressings, and it’s clear the appeal isn’t nostalgia—it’s experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1643" data-end="1920"&gt;It’s more than nostalgia, too. Neuroscience shows that music strongly &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/music-emotional-memory-28964/?.com"&gt;engages the amygdala and hippocampus&lt;/a&gt;—areas essential to emotional memory. That helps explain why a scratched Fleetwood Mac LP your parents played still hits differently than the same track streamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1927" data-end="1949"&gt;2. Film photography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1951" data-end="2100"&gt;I still remember the first time I developed photos in a darkroom back in high school. It felt like magic watching the image slowly appear on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2102" data-end="2382"&gt;For a long time, digital cameras and then smartphones made film feel unnecessary. But Gen Z is bringing it back with gusto. They’re buying vintage cameras, experimenting with expired rolls of film, and posting grainy snapshots that feel more authentic than polished iPhone pics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2384" data-end="2602"&gt;It’s not about getting the “perfect” shot—it’s about embracing imperfection, waiting to see the results, and valuing the surprise. There’s something deeply human about not being able to delete a bad photo right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2604" data-end="2798"&gt;As Susan Sontag once wrote, “All photographs are memento mori.” Gen Z seems to understand that intuitively. A film photo isn’t just an image; it’s proof of a moment, locked into physical form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2800" data-end="3020"&gt;The patience involved matters too. In a world of instant gratification, waiting for film to develop introduces anticipation—something psychologists link to higher dopamine release when the final result finally arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3027" data-end="3056"&gt;3. Thrifting and upcycling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3058" data-end="3159"&gt;Thrift stores used to be where boomers went out of necessity. Now they’re treasure hunts for Gen Z.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3161" data-end="3416"&gt;This generation has made secondhand cool again—not just for affordability but also for sustainability. They’re not just shopping thrift; they’re flipping clothes, repurposing furniture, and upcycling in ways that would make a 1970s DIY enthusiast proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3418" data-end="3639"&gt;I’ve mentioned this before, but the psychology of ownership changes when you’ve invested time in transforming something. That jacket you re-dyed or that chair you refinished? It’s not just yours—it’s part of your story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3641" data-end="3870"&gt;Economists call this the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect?.com"&gt;“IKEA effect”&lt;/a&gt;—the tendency for people to overvalue things they’ve put effort into creating. Gen Z is applying that principle at scale, mixing fashion with identity and creativity with eco-consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3872" data-end="4060"&gt;And unlike boomers, they’re sharing the process online. TikToks of thrift flips regularly get millions of views, proving that the creativity is just as important as the finished product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4067" data-end="4082"&gt;4. Gardening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4084" data-end="4253"&gt;Boomers grew up with backyard gardens partly out of practicality. Food prices were lower when you grew it yourself, and homegrown tomatoes always tasted better anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4255" data-end="4519"&gt;Gen Z is rediscovering gardening too—but often for entirely different reasons. Beyond food, it’s become a mental-health ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4255" data-end="4519"&gt;Experimental research in the &lt;em data-start="157" data-end="187"&gt;Journal of Health Psychology&lt;/em&gt; found that just 30 minutes of gardening led to significantly &lt;a href="https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/gardening-promotes-neuroendocrine-and-affective-restoration-from-?.com"&gt;stronger reductions in cortisol&lt;/a&gt; (the stress hormone) and a full restoration of positive mood compared to indoor reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4521" data-end="4721"&gt;Balcony gardens, indoor herb pots, even TikToks of “cottagecore” aesthetics—all point back to something boomers did without giving it much thought: connecting to the earth and growing your own food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4723" data-end="4986"&gt;When I was traveling through Japan a few years ago, I noticed how many people maintained tiny balcony gardens in dense cities. That image stuck with me, and it’s the same trend I now see online: Gen Z carving out little sanctuaries of green in urban apartments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4988" data-end="5163"&gt;The beauty of this trend is that it’s not only grounding (literally), but it also taps into a sense of self-sufficiency that’s psychologically reassuring in uncertain times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5170" data-end="5199"&gt;5. Knitting and crocheting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5201" data-end="5304"&gt;Once dismissed as something only grandmothers did, knitting and crocheting are back with a vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5306" data-end="5523"&gt;Scroll through Etsy or Instagram and you’ll see handmade sweaters, funky hats, and creative designs that look nothing like the beige scarves of the past. Gen Z isn’t just following patterns—they’re reinventing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5525" data-end="5788"&gt;I picked up knitting while traveling through Iceland years ago, and there’s a kind of meditative flow to it. Loop by loop, row by row, you’re literally creating something from nothing. For a generation bombarded by screens, that slowness is a form of rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5790" data-end="6067"&gt;Clinical psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who coined the concept of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi?.com"&gt;“flow,”&lt;/a&gt; once noted that people feel happiest when fully absorbed in an activity that challenges them just enough. Knitting is a perfect example—it’s simple but demands focus, and the payoff is tangible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6069" data-end="6258"&gt;Even better, the community aspect is alive again. Online forums, TikTok “stitch clubs,” and in-person meetups have turned what was once a solitary activity into a vibrant social movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6265" data-end="6278"&gt;6. Bowling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6280" data-end="6456"&gt;Bowling alleys used to be the quintessential Friday night outing for boomers. Then they went through a bit of a decline—replaced by multiplexes, malls, and later video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6458" data-end="6663"&gt;But now? Bowling is making a comeback. Retro aesthetics, neon-lit alleys, and even boutique “luxury” bowling venues have captured Gen Z’s attention. It’s social, it’s silly, and it’s refreshingly analog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6665" data-end="6971"&gt;Psychologists note that &lt;a href="https://realitypathing.com/why-do-group-activities-enhance-social-connections/?.com"&gt;group activities&lt;/a&gt; grounded in shared goals—like trying to knock down pins together—forge powerful bonds. Participating in light‑hearted, collective challenges like bowling encourages emotional cohesion and connection, especially in a generation that prioritizes experience over perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6973" data-end="7264"&gt;I was reminded of this on a trip to Portland, where a friend dragged me to a vintage-style bowling alley complete with old-school scoring sheets and craft beer. The vibe wasn’t competitive—it was collaborative, goofy, and strangely wholesome. Exactly the sort of night Gen Z is hungry for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7271" data-end="7287"&gt;7. Book clubs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7289" data-end="7517"&gt;Boomers joined book clubs to socialize, exchange ideas, and maybe drink a little wine. Gen Z is picking up that same tradition, only now it’s mixed with online communities, Discord servers, and TikTok’s famous “BookTok” trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7519" data-end="7824"&gt;I’ve seen twenty-somethings organize meetups around classics like &lt;em data-start="7585" data-end="7606"&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/em&gt; and contemporary works like Colleen Hoover novels. It’s less about academic analysis and more about connection—sharing emotional takeaways, swapping recommendations, and using books as a bridge to real conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7826" data-end="8051"&gt;As noted by author Zadie Smith, “The very reason I read is so I can live more than one life in more than one place.” Gen Z has tapped into that sentiment in a big way, turning reading into both a personal and social ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8053" data-end="8255"&gt;It’s also a reaction to digital fatigue. Reading, by its nature, forces you to focus on one narrative. When paired with a club or discussion, it satisfies two cravings at once: solitude and community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8262" data-end="8280"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8282" data-end="8308"&gt;What’s old is new again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8310" data-end="8459"&gt;Gen Z isn’t simply copying boomer hobbies; they’re reimagining them through their own lens—sustainability, mindfulness, creativity, and connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8461" data-end="8570"&gt;It’s a reminder that trends don’t really disappear. They just wait for the right moment to be rediscovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8572" data-end="8686"&gt;So maybe the next time you’re tempted to dismiss something as “outdated,” ask yourself: is it actually timeless?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On Sept. 4, 2025, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is scheduled to &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/28/robert-kennedy-senate-hearing-cdc-00533906"&gt;testify before the Senate Finance Committee&lt;/a&gt;, where he is expected to face questions about his vaccine policies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days prior, on Sept. 1, 2025, President Donald Trump demanded pharmaceutical companies &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/01/trump-cdc-truth-social-covid/"&gt;to prove that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work&lt;/a&gt;, saying that the CDC was “being ripped apart over this question.” It was his first public acknowledgment of the chaos roiling the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-director-monarez-out-confirmed-rfk-jr-rcna227620"&gt;amid the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent resignations of four high-level agency officials. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/rfk-resign-cdc-susan-monarez-fired"&gt;public health experts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5483021-hhs-employees-call-for-rfk-resignation/"&gt;HHS staffers&lt;/a&gt; are calling for Kennedy to be fired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The turmoil comes about a month after &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html"&gt;HHS announced US$500 million in funding cuts&lt;/a&gt; for 22 research contracts on mRNA vaccine technology. The agency said it will instead pour these funds into research on a traditional approach to designing vaccines that was &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/a-brief-history-of-vaccination"&gt;first used more than 200 years ago&lt;/a&gt;. With such vaccines, &lt;a href="https://www.immunology.org/public-information/vaccine-resources/covid-19/covid-19-vaccine-infographics/types-covid19-vaccines"&gt;called whole-virus vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, a person’s immune system is &lt;a href="https://www.immunology.org/public-information/vaccine-resources/covid-19/covid-19-vaccine-infographics/types-covid19-vaccines"&gt;presented with the whole virus&lt;/a&gt;, often in weakened or inactivated form. This switcheroo &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/13/nx-s1-5384934/trump-universal-flu-vaccine"&gt;has puzzled many scientists&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://microbiology.washington.edu/people/faculty/deborah-fuller"&gt;As a vaccinologist&lt;/a&gt; who has &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eNprtJEAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;studied and developed vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for over 35 years, I  see that the science behind mRNA vaccine technology is being widely misstated. This incorrect information is shaping long-term health policy in the U.S. – which makes it urgent to correct the record. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Are mRNA vaccines less safe than whole-virus vaccines?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HHS defended its cancellation of mRNA vaccine research based, in part, on a nonpeer-reviewed compilation of selected publications called the &lt;a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26047485/mrna-vaccine-harms-research-collection-v2.pdf"&gt;COVID-19 mRNA “vaccine” harms research collection&lt;/a&gt;. This document lists about 750 articles claimed to describe harms caused by mRNA vaccines against COVID-19. However, the vast majority of these articles aren’t about vaccines but about the harms of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. And notably absent from it is the huge body of data &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.45602"&gt;showing mRNA vaccines actually prevent these harms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Spike proteins on SARS-COV-2 can cause tissue damage – and although mRNA vaccines produce them in small amounts, they prevent the virus from replicating to produce them in large amounts.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:3D_medical_animation_coronavirus_structure.jpg"&gt;https://www.scientificanimations.com/wiki-images/&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the document being used to justify RFK Jr.’s claims about mRNA vaccines highlights 375 studies reporting that the virus’s spike protein alone, which is produced when the virus replicates, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1616106"&gt;can cause excessive inflammation and tissue damage&lt;/a&gt;. This is true. But the document marshals this evidence to support the claim that mRNA vaccines, which are designed to produce spike proteins, cause the same harm – which is not accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While viral replication results in uncontrolled production of a large amounts of the protein, the way it’s produced by the mRNA vaccine is very different. The vaccine produces a &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2023/07/mrna-vaccine-spike-protein-differs-from-viral-version.html"&gt;small, controlled amount of spike protein inside a few cells&lt;/a&gt; – just enough to induce an immune response without causing damage. And by blocking the virus’s replication, it reduces the amount of spike protein in circulation, actually having the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What about side effects like myocarditis?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early reports flagged a type of &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/myocarditis"&gt;heart swelling called myocarditis&lt;/a&gt; as a rare side effect of the mRNA vaccine, particularly for young men ages 18 to 25 after a booster dose. A 2024 review identified &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines12101193"&gt;about 20 cases out of 1 million people&lt;/a&gt; who received the vaccine. However, that same study found that unvaccinated people had an elevenfold higher risk of getting myocarditis after a COVID-19 infection than vaccinated people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, another 2024 study showed that people who &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2024.16380"&gt;developed myocarditis after vaccination had fewer complications&lt;/a&gt; than those who developed the condition after getting infected with COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Do mRNA vaccines make the SARS-CoV-2 virus resistant?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another claim from the &lt;a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26047485/mrna-vaccine-harms-research-collection-v2.pdf"&gt;compilation of supposed mRNA vaccine harms&lt;/a&gt; that was cited as a reason for cutting funding for mRNA technology is that mRNA vaccines &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74dzdddvmjo"&gt;cause mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus&lt;/a&gt; that make them resistant or less susceptible to the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a virus replicates in its host, it produces millions of copies of its genetic material. Mutations are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/rfk-jr-is-wrong-about-mrna-vaccines-a-scientist-explains-how-they-make-covid-less-deadly-262776"&gt;copying errors that occur naturally&lt;/a&gt; during the replication process. These acquired mutations produce new variants, which is why both the COVID-19 mRNA and the whole-virus flu vaccine get updated annually – to keep up with natural changes in the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowing down viral replication decreases the rate at which &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-800964-2.00017-3"&gt;a virus can acquire new mutations&lt;/a&gt;. Since both mRNA and whole-virus vaccines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-021-00544-9"&gt;stop or slow the virus from replicating&lt;/a&gt;, both types of vaccines help reduce the emergence of resistant viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viruses can mutate to escape from antibodies, but the mRNA vaccines are not causing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.211021"&gt;the emergence of more virulent strains&lt;/a&gt;, likely for at least two reasons. First, mRNA vaccines induce immune responses that can attack the virus at multiple spots, so it would have to come up with many mutations at once to escape the vaccine’s defenses. Second, even if the virus could acquire all these mutations, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/vaccines-will-not-produce-worse-variants"&gt;they would likely weaken it&lt;/a&gt;, making it unable to cause or even transmit disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;mRNA vaccines versus new SARS-CoV-2 variants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, in &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1952851097019633766"&gt;announcing cuts to mRNA vaccine research&lt;/a&gt; on Aug. 5, 2025, claimed that mRNA vaccines don’t work against respiratory viruses and that HHS was moving toward “safer, broader vaccine platforms that &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html"&gt;remain effective even as viruses mutate&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both whole-virus vaccines and mRNA vaccines protected against COVID-19 and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.2223"&gt;prevented hospitalization and death&lt;/a&gt; for millions of people worldwide between 2020 and 2024, but there’s clear evidence that the &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/23510/estimated-effectiveness-of-covid-19-vaccine-candidates/"&gt;mRNA-based vaccines&lt;/a&gt; provided &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciac288"&gt;significantly better protection&lt;/a&gt; than whole-virus vaccines. And for COVID-19, mRNA vaccines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2022.2122582"&gt;are more effective against new variants&lt;/a&gt;, which emerge as viruses mutate, than whole-virus vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;mRNA vaccines’ superpower is that they can be updated and manufactured very quickly, unlike traditional whole-virus vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.2002083"&gt;started with exceptionally high efficacy&lt;/a&gt;, exceeding 94%. When the &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/covid-variants-timeline-6741198"&gt;SARS-CoV-2 delta and omicron variants emerged&lt;/a&gt; in the spring and fall of 2021, mRNA vaccines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2023.2167410"&gt;became less effective in preventing infections&lt;/a&gt;. However, they remained &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2022.4299"&gt;highly effective in preventing severe illness&lt;/a&gt;, whereas in unvaccinated people the rates of severe illness and hospitalization remained high. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because mRNA vaccines induce the immune system to make &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.737083"&gt;both antibodies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72619"&gt;specialized immune cells called T cells&lt;/a&gt;. These elements can recognize multiple parts of the virus, including ones that don’t change, enabling significant protection against new variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the mRNA vaccines have a superpower that no other type of vaccine can currently match: They can be &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/COVID-19-mRNA-Vaccine-Production"&gt;quickly updated and manufactured&lt;/a&gt; within two to three months. To develop a whole-virus vaccine, researchers must first &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(11)60412-6/fulltext"&gt;spend months isolating and propagating the virus&lt;/a&gt;. Conversely, making an mRNA vaccine &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymthe.2019.01.020"&gt;requires just sequencing the virus’s genetic code&lt;/a&gt; – a process that today takes just hours.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a new pandemic began today, mRNA vaccines are currently the only type of vaccine that could be developed quickly enough to disrupt its spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The future of mRNA vaccine technologies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty years ago, when scientists &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-02483-w"&gt;first started developing mRNA vaccine technology&lt;/a&gt;, they recognized its potential to overcome &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/viiii/infographics/how-does-mrna-vaccine-compare-traditional-vaccine"&gt;major limitations of whole-virus vaccines&lt;/a&gt; – namely, slow production time and more limited ability to protect from new viral variants. Today, mRNA vaccines are also being developed to prevent or treat diseases including &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-mrna-and-dna-vaccines-could-soon-treat-cancers-hiv-autoimmune-disorders-and-genetic-diseases-170772"&gt;HIV and cancer, as well as autoimmune and genetic diseases&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addr.2024.115419"&gt;this technology can be further improved&lt;/a&gt;. New mRNA vaccine technologies are aimed, among other things, at making mRNA vaccines easier to store to allow for faster distribution and reduce their short-term side effects, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omtn.2025.102595"&gt;eliminate the rare risk of myocarditis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omtn.2025.102654"&gt;more quickly block a respiratory infection&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health is funneling money away from new mRNA technologies toward a single project &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/hhs-nih-launch-next-generation-universal-vaccine-platform-pandemic-prone-viruses"&gt;developing universal vaccines&lt;/a&gt; based on traditional whole-virus vaccine technology. &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/working-towards-a-universal-influenza-vaccine/"&gt;Universal vaccines are urgently needed&lt;/a&gt; to provide broader protection against ever-changing respiratory viruses, such as influenza, that are major pandemic threats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2022 study in mice and ferrets &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abo2167"&gt;showed that a universal flu vaccine NIH plans to support has promise&lt;/a&gt;. However, multiple studies of potential &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abm0271"&gt;universal flu vaccines based on mRNA technology&lt;/a&gt; show &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines12060664"&gt;even more potential&lt;/a&gt;. Such vaccines could induce broader immunity than whole-virus vaccines by eliciting antibody and T-cell responses that &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-do-you-make-a-universal-flu-vaccine-a-microbiologist-explains-the-challenges-and-how-mrna-could-offer-a-promising-solution-195807"&gt;target an even wider range of flu viruses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to square those benefits with the fact that HHS and NIH have named the planned new universal vaccine platform “&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-nih-announces-generation-gold-standard.html"&gt;Generation Gold Standard&lt;/a&gt;,” insisting that it represents a new standard in science and transparency. The effort seems more akin to eliminating all e-bike technology and telling everyone who seeks one to get by with a single brand of a 10-speed bike: Getting to the intended destination may still be possible, but it will be slower and harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the case of abandoning mRNA vaccine research, it may lead to lives needlessly lost, whether due to potential medicines untapped or to pandemic unpreparedness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p class="nih-pretitle"&gt;Wednesday, September 3, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;h1&gt;One dose of antibiotic treats early syphilis as well as three doses &lt;/h1&gt;
                  &lt;p class="nih-subtitle"&gt;NIH-funded clinical trial shows potential to simplify treatment for early syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have found that a single injection of the antibiotic benzathine penicillin G (BPG) successfully treated early syphilis just as well as the three-injection regimen used by many clinicians in the United States and elsewhere. These findings from a late-stage clinical trial suggest the second and third doses of conventional BPG therapy do not provide a health benefit. The results were published today in &lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Benzathine penicillin G is highly effective against syphilis, but the three-dose regimen can be burdensome and deter people from attending follow-up visits with their healthcare providers,” said Carolyn Deal, Ph.D., chief of the enteric and sexually transmitted infections branch of NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). “The new findings offer welcome evidence for potentially simplifying treatment with an equally effective one-dose regimen, particularly while syphilis rates remain alarmingly high.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syphilis is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Treponema pallidum. &lt;/em&gt;The United States reported 209,253 total syphilis cases and 3,882 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/syphilis/about/about-congenital-syphilis.html"&gt;congenital syphilis&lt;/a&gt; cases in 2023, representing 61% and 108% increases over 2019 numbers, respectively. Without treatment, syphilis can result in neurological and organ damage as well as severe pregnancy complications and congenital abnormalities. Syphilis can also increase a person’s likelihood of acquiring or transmitting HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BPG is one of the few antibiotics known to effectively treat syphilis, and stockouts are common worldwide. The antibiotic is currently being imported to the United States to resolve a &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/drugshortages/dsp_ActiveIngredientDetails.cfm?AI=Penicillin%20G%20Benzathine%20Injection&amp;amp;st=c&amp;amp;tab=tabs-1"&gt;nationwide shortage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted at ten U.S. sites and enrolled 249 participants with early syphilis, which encompasses the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/syphilis/about/#cdc_disease_basics_symptoms-signs-and-symptoms"&gt;primary, secondary, and early latent&lt;/a&gt; stages of disease. Sixty-four percent of participants were living with HIV and 97% were men. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either a single intramuscular (IM) injection of BPG 2.4 million units (MU) or a series of three IM injections of BPG 2.4 MU at weekly intervals. All participants were monitored for safety. Biological markers of successful treatment in the blood—known as the serologic response to therapy—were examined at six months following treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seventy-six percent of participants in the single-dose group had a serologic response to treatment compared to 70% of participants in the three-dose group. The difference between groups was not statistically significant, even when participants were stratified by HIV status. One participant developed signs of neurosyphilis three days after starting BPG therapy and was excluded from the analysis. Three serious adverse events were reported but were not related to BPG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Syphilis has been studied and treated for more than a century, and BPG has been in use for more than 50 years, yet we are still acquiring knowledge to help us optimize treatment,” said Principal Investigator Edward W. Hook III, M.D., emeritus professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “We hope these promising results will be complemented by scientific advances in syphilis prevention and diagnosis.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the study authors, the results from this trial provide substantial evidence that single-dose BPG 2.4 MU is as effective as three doses in treating early syphilis. More research is needed to understand the full potential of this abbreviated treatment strategy and to evaluate therapeutic approaches for all stages of syphilis, including late syphilis, latent syphilis of unknown duration, and clinical neurosyphilis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted through the NIAID-funded Sexually Transmitted Infections Clinical Trials Group.&lt;/p&gt;

It changes with your activity, stress, and even how hydrated you are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, though, monitoring your heartrate meant using special devices like hospital monitors or smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz (&lt;a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCSC&lt;/a&gt;), have shown that something as common as Wi-Fi can measure this vital sign with surprising accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new system, called Pulse-Fi, transforms ordinary wireless signals into &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fitness-tracking-apple-watch-is-helpful-but-not-always-right/"&gt;health trackers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It promises a future where people can monitor their heart health without strapping on devices or relying on costly hospital machinery – all of this can be achieved using Wi-Fi devices that already exist in most homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-wi-fi-the-basics"&gt;Understanding Wi-Fi – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wi-Fi works by sending information through the air using radio waves, the same type of waves that carry music to your car radio. The difference is that Wi-Fi uses much &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024169940" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;higher frequencies&lt;/a&gt;, which lets it carry far more data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside your router, a tiny transmitter turns digital information – like a video or a message – into patterns of radio waves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your phone or laptop has an antenna and receiver that catch those waves and turn them back into the pictures, sounds, or words you see on your screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s like tossing a ball back and forth, but instead of a ball, the “catch” is a stream of invisible energy carrying coded information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those radio waves don’t travel forever, though. Walls, floors, and even water in the human body can block or weaken them, which is the basic premise behind Pulse-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-turning-wi-fi-into-pulse-fi"&gt;Turning Wi-Fi into Pulse-Fi&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UC Santa Cruz team included Professor Katia Obraczka, Ph.D. student Nayan Bhatia, and visiting high school researcher Pranay Kocheta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, they created a low-cost method that pairs Wi-Fi transmitters and receivers with machine learning algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9287836/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wi-Fi waves&lt;/a&gt; move through space, bouncing and bending around objects. When those waves encounter the human body, tiny signal shifts occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulse-Fi’s algorithms analyze those faint disturbances to pick out the rhythm of a heartbeat while filtering out unrelated movements or environmental noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The signal is very sensitive to the environment, so we have to select the right filters to remove all the unnecessary noise,” Bhatia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heartbeats-measured-in-seconds"&gt;Heartbeats measured in seconds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 118 participants, and the results were impressive. After only five seconds of analysis, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulse-Fi measured &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/increased-heart-rate-makes-us-feel-time-passing-faster/"&gt;heartrate&lt;/a&gt; with an error margin of just half a beat per minute. Longer monitoring improved accuracy even further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested people in varied body positions – sitting, standing, lying down, and even walking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of position, the system worked reliably. Hardware placement in the room also made little difference, proving the system’s adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-cost components powered the tests. ESP32 chips, which cost under ten dollars, performed well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raspberry Pi devices, though more expensive, achieved even better results. Commercial-grade Wi-Fi hardware could improve performance further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-distance-doesn-t-break-accuracy"&gt;Distance doesn’t break accuracy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another breakthrough was range. Pulse-Fi measured heart rate accurately at distances up to three meters, or nearly ten feet. Additional tests suggest it can perform even farther.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we found was that because of the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/machine-learning-could-revolutionize-drug-discovery/"&gt;machine learning model&lt;/a&gt;, that distance apart basically had no effect on performance, which was a very big struggle for past models,” Kocheta said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The other thing was position – all the different things you encounter in day to day life, we wanted to make sure we were robust to however a person is living.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-creating-pulse-fi-datasets"&gt;Creating Pulse-Fi datasets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To train their system, the team needed data. No existing dataset captured heartbeat effects on Wi-Fi signals from ESP32 devices, so they built their own. In the UC Santa Cruz Science and Engineering Library, they carefully set up ESP32 units alongside standard oximeters to generate parallel data streams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pairing provided a dependable “ground truth” for training, ensuring that every &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/smartwatches-can-now-detect-cardiac-arrest/"&gt;pulse&lt;/a&gt; recorded through Wi-Fi could be accurately matched with the medically verified heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then trained a neural network to recognize which subtle signal changes represented heartbeats, focusing on even the faintest variations in the wireless data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside their newly built dataset, they validated Pulse-Fi using a large dataset from Brazil collected with Raspberry Pi hardware – one of the most comprehensive Wi-Fi-based health monitoring datasets available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That cross-testing confirmed the system’s broad reliability and showed that Pulse-Fi could adapt across device types, room conditions, and participant groups. It demonstrated that a low-cost approach could achieve remarkable accuracy under diverse real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wi-fi-as-health-guardian"&gt;Wi-Fi as health guardian&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulse-Fi’s creators are not stopping here. They are now adapting the system to detect &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dogs-can-feel-our-emotions-through-our-heart-rate/"&gt;breathing&lt;/a&gt; rates. Early results show strong potential for diagnosing issues like sleep apnea, where subtle breathing patterns are crucial for detection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a capability could give doctors new insights into sleep quality, respiratory problems, and long-term health risks – without the need for intrusive overnight monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining affordability, accuracy, and non-intrusiveness, Pulse-Fi points to a future where everyday Wi-Fi doubles as a quiet guardian of health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smart homes could eventually integrate the system, providing continuous tracking of both heart and lung function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This advancement would make preventive care more accessible, offering people the chance to detect health issues early and share reliable data with clinicians. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What once required specialized devices might soon be handled by the invisible signals already surrounding us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11096342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IEEE Xplore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 22:35:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxQMWFzcnMtX0YtaUJHaTBXdWxJZlJmWmhHM0NwTjRwbGtaRnZBNkNrLVJ1NmJ4MEs4UGZ1cTRMeld2WENmeDNKN1dsWkVsbU5WNVRrdDFpN2xxX2s5NVVBU00ycmVFTVhoUTNpLUxUa0g0RTUzanFSa0lyMVNrX3E0a0lHV213ZWh5SlNOa1BPaXZ0bmVuNVVmN1hWVE9NdkRlQ2c</guid></item><item><title>肯尼迪将为疫苗咨询小组增加新成员--《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/03/health/rfk-jr-acip-vaccine-members.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 22:32:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFA1OUtqdExkZ0xIS1QxbGZwNFNBYU4yTEVDSmNmN0JRWWhmUTNoV0hwODFCdEVQX3hoYjVGbGhYaU13UUdFdnJpSEFiLTdmTG1WWnNZOVF1V2NFZ3ZOMkZZSVpVWElaX0dESExfZVhxSjhWZjU4VE92dy0yQ0dHakk</guid></item><item><title>肯尼迪准备任命新的疫苗小组成员-Politico</title><link>https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/03/kennedy-prepares-to-name-new-acip-members-00542750</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Politico</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 22:32:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPRmEySlA1V0k5a2hXX1lEdEVpdnd0Rmg0ZVBxc0x5ekVJX0FjWmZucW41Q19Rb0g5Y25kSTV2Y19pLVFHckZGMGl2Z3M0Z0h1SFc4dTh1S0Z4aWVFQ25PT3QyZ2JjSnBFbXFsOFlITGh2Y2czcVlNQU1sUFNPVHUtTFExTlhwZHRieTVWdVB5ZEpHRjhhVmc</guid></item><item><title>Lynchburg的800万$圆形剧场项目提前完成，将推动市中心业务- WSET</title><link>https://wset.com/news/local/lynchburgs-8m-amphitheater-project-ahead-of-schedule-set-to-boost-downtown-businesses-riverfront-park-local-economy-september-2025-hill-city</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;LYNCHBURG, Va. (WSET) — &lt;/span&gt;A major project in downtown Lynchburg, that's been in the works for more than 20 years, is coming to life. The city has invested $8 million into the Riverfront Park Amphitheater, and the structure is coming together quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Things are going really well right now. The contractor is significantly ahead of schedule, and we're super excited," said Clay Simmons, Lynchburg's deputy director of Public Works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simmons said it's exciting to watch the structure come to life, right before his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It'll start looking an awful lot like a finished structure here pretty soon," he said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downtown business owners, like John Seinar, who owns Bikes Unlimited and Trailhead restaurant, said they're excited for the new addition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't explain how excited we are for the amphitheater project. When they first presented the idea for the project, we were huge advocates for it," he said. "I'm just really excited that the city rallied behind it and it went through, and they're getting it done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seinar said once open, he thinks it'll drive more business downtown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Downtown was missing a really big, main draw. We have a bunch of phenomenal small businesses downtown, and that has always kind of been a collective draw," Seinar said. "Now, we have, like, a really big hub that I think will draw a lot of people not only from Lynchburg, but from hours away. It's going to drive a ton of revenue to our city, it's going to bring people who don't normally come down here and showcase all of the great existing businesses we have down here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave Henderson, who owns the Water Dog and the Glass House, right beside the amphitheater, said he's already seen more business from the first phase of the Riverfront Park project. In May, the Kiwanis playground and an indoor restroom facility opened on Jefferson Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED:&lt;a href="https://wset.com/news/local/lynchburgs-riverfront-park-unveils-new-ada-accessible-playground-after-six-year-effort-jefferson-street-kiwanis-club-va-virginia-downtown-may-2025#" target="_blank" title="https://wset.com/news/local/lynchburgs-riverfront-park-unveils-new-ada-accessible-playground-after-six-year-effort-jefferson-street-kiwanis-club-va-virginia-downtown-may-2025#" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt; Lynchburg's Riverfront Park unveils new ADA accessible playground after six-year effort&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;There's definitely been an influx of new customers," he said. "We really think it's going to bring a new vibrancy to downtown, and we're excited to see what happens.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henderson has owned businesses downtown for years. He said it's been awesome to watch the Hill City evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you had asked me, when we first opened the Water Dog back in 2016, if I ever thought anything like this would ever happen, I'd say 'Never in my wildest dreams,'" he said. "Seeing how the city has come together to support these projects has been really great to see. I love seeing the city invest in its downtown, and being a part of it is really special."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business owners said the amphitheater is exactly what downtown Lynchburg needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's a new vibrancy that is really exciting for downtown, and I think a lot of my business neighbors are really excited," Henderson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The city's obviously invested a lot of money down here. We're really thankful for that, and it means a lot to the people who not only live down here but own businesses. It affects everyone in town, so I think it's a great thing," Seinar added.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simmons said the amphitheater structure will be mostly finished in the next three or four months. Then, they hope to have it up and running by next spring, with acts coming to play in the Hill City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city has said they plan to have a shuttle service available, while utilizing downtown parking, when acts perform at the venue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're really hoping to get some higher-end acts by having the level of facility that we're gonna have when we're done. So, hopefully it'll be a big success," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WSET</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 22:31:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_AFBVV95cUxONVF1emc5YU9VWGh1UDlJclFTU0xEU0Zab3M2RjRNS04tWVBPbnZGbkhWTTVudTBKV3ZiTExWYkJjdGF3TENMMGxqLVFhTWJOdzZlUGhHQldYOUloblR2UWNVVncxeDd3Zy1lR0djQUhkbVlBZU9PZmhhZU9WZFk4bHZWWGlUcW9WRDhVaHdYZWozbk9VWXV1MWQ1SlFvb2xXalZxeHBwY1FvdzM2Qmw0MDVoaC03UGg2LUxybElqRzlKVENlbnpVdWRveEFtY1QtUU9sME9HNTFDcEwxZmxvNWtUU245OTJueVViT2trUVpwOE5zMnd1UUdIeDY</guid></item><item><title>Lynchburg的800万$圆形剧场项目提前完成，将推动市中心业务- WSET</title><link>https://wset.com/newsletter-daily/lynchburgs-8m-amphitheater-project-ahead-of-schedule-set-to-boost-downtown-businesses-riverfront-park-local-economy-september-2025-hill-city</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;LYNCHBURG, Va.
