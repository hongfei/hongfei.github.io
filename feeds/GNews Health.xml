    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood samples were taken at the start of the study, half-way through and again six weeks later to track&lt;span&gt; cholesterol, blood sugar levels and inflammation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers also carried out a glucose tolerance test at the start and end of the study—measuring participants' response to sugar. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the end of the study those who ate chickpeas daily experienced a significant decrease in cholesterol levels, from 200.4mg per deciliter of blood at the start of the study, to 185.8mg at the end. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Total cholesterol levels above 200mg/dl are considered high, while figures below this are normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those eating black beans were also found to have lower levels of inflammation after 12 weeks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers concluded: 'Our study found that bean consumption helped significantly lower cholesterol and reduce inflammation in people with prediabetes.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Critically, Prof Smith advised people who want to introduce beans into their daily diets to be cautious of any additional ingredients commonly found in the products—such as salt or sugar, both of which have been linked with heart disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Almost six million people in the UK have diabetes, of which 90 pre cent is type 2, but charities estimate there 1.2million people are living with disease undiagnosed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They used the &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/CRISPR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CRISPR&lt;/a&gt; method to insert an archaic variant of the GLI3 gene, which is linked to skeletal development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rodents soon showed noticeably altered bone structures and other unexpected traits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery was made possible by scientists at &lt;a href="https://www.h.kpu-m.ac.jp/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; who introduced this ancient DNA segment to assess its role in shaping skeletal anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gli3-gene-and-skeletal-changes"&gt;GLI3 gene and skeletal changes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few of the mice who were edited with the GLI3 gene displayed wider &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/recreating-the-face-of-dragon-man-harbin-skull-denisovans-an-ancient-human-cousin/"&gt;craniums&lt;/a&gt; than their unmodified counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some also presented a reduced number of vertebrae or unusual rib configurations that were consistent with the older genetic template. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers drew attention to the fact that these modifications were not random anomalies, but specific skeletal features pointing to structural changes once found in extinct hominins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg3068" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hedgehog pathway&lt;/a&gt;, a key developmental system in mammals, did not show catastrophic disruption in these mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/gli3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;archaic version&lt;/a&gt; of the GLI3 gene quietly adjusted how early bone patterning genes behaved, sparing the animals from severe birth defects yet nudging their skeletons in unexpected directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genetic-background-influences"&gt;Genetic background influences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists noted that these skeletal changes differed depending on each mouse’s broader genetic makeup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some mice on one background strain showed extra rib formation at the 14th thoracic position, while others had scoliosis-like rib angles. A fraction exhibited quicker fusion of skull plates, prompting a larger skull shape over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, none of these mice exhibited polydactyly, a trait often linked to major GLI3 gene disturbances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding suggests that the archaic variant managed to retain the gene’s essential functions while selectively modifying certain skeletal features, which likely mirrored developmental paths in archaic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-did-humans-start-talking-scientists-may-have-found-the-answer/"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-modern-traces-of-the-gli3-gene"&gt;Modern traces of the GLI3 gene&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular GLI3 variant, known as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15393" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;R1537C&lt;/a&gt;, still appears in some human populations outside Africa at rates between 3.7% and 7.7%, though it is much less common in other groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible that in ancient groups with smaller population sizes, these changes persisted through genetic drift rather than strict adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In small-scale tests involving cultured human cells, the archaic gene shifted expression of certain downstream targets tied to bone growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings back the idea that a subtle but steady influence of archaic traits may endure in the broader human gene pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-views-on-ancient-dna"&gt;Views on ancient DNA&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-neanderthalensis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neanderthals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mysterious-denisovan-species-humans-lived-undisturbed-tibetan-plateau-160000-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Denisovans&lt;/a&gt;, both prehistoric relatives of modern humans, occasionally contributed genes to our ancestors. The presence of archaic DNA in living humans has been linked to various traits, including some skeletal features. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly edited mice offered a concrete glimpse of how small genetic differences might have forged physical contrasts among ancient populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/03082319/mice_neanderthal-dna_GLI3-gene_altered-morphology_credit-KPUM_1m.webp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/03082309/mice_neanderthal-dna_GLI3-gene_altered-morphology_credit-KPMU_1s.webp" alt="Altered skeletal morphology of the mice carrying a Neanderthal/Denisovan type GLI3 variant(A) Structures of modern human or extinct hominins GLI3, wild type mouse Gli3 (Gli31540R), and mouse Gli3 with a Neanderthal/Denisovans variant (Gli31540C).

That statement highlights how subtle gene tweaks can mold skeletal architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-gli3-gene-matters"&gt;Why the GLI3 gene matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GLI3 protein sits at the crossroads of multiple developmental processes, but it is especially vital for shaping bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies on the GLI3 gene have revealed its involvement in conditions where limb or craniofacial structures form atypically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of those disorders arise when the gene is fully inactivated, a far cry from this single amino acid switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1225829" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;examinations&lt;/a&gt; of other archaic DNA segments examined immunity and even pain responses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This updated research extends such work into the realm of skeletal differences, showing that one minor coding change can produce noticeable effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also underscores how ancient DNA, when tested in living models, provides a clear window on long-lost biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-skeletal-insights-from-extinct-dna"&gt;Skeletal insights from extinct DNA&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists who work with extinct &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/115000-year-old-human-footprints-found-alathar-lake-arabian-peninsula/"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; DNA rely on fossils and advanced genomics to piece together the puzzle of our origins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet skeletal remains alone cannot show how each gene variant behaved during development. Rodent models like these can fill that gap, offering a living system to track gene function in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study highlights how archaic changes, buried in genetic code for tens of thousands of years, can still produce phenotypic impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if many such variations fell out of circulation, remnants linger in some modern genomes, adding subtle diversity to our species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happens-next"&gt;What happens next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers emphasize that more investigation is needed to confirm whether this arcane variant ever delivered a clear advantage for extinct populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some evidence from biobank data suggests connections to spinal traits, but the small numbers make firm conclusions tricky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the success of this gene-editing work brings fresh awareness of our shared evolutionary links. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As new findings emerge, scientists will be better positioned to understand how each archaic segment contributed to the ancient &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/homo-juluensis-new-human-species-vanished-just-fifty-thousand-years-ago/"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; form, and what it might still mean for people today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/2333268/bio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Ako Agata&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tadashi-Nomura" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Tadashi Nomura&lt;/a&gt; at Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine who led this important and fascinating study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.03.547394v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 14:28:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxPeHFPSm9NMkFYWHlJNzJObjIzblNBZVpfVWZHbTExVElzVG5nOUZKTlpOaUYwN3NsczRnQzhPeE1QZng0MkpCQ29qTlRPeW02X1l2UGVjcWtidU83UjRsNnNxY0l2c3V0dkpGZDVCaTJJS1lWRG5WMHA1a01Tbll3bGtKLTlNY3I0cHBrNVMwSjdDSkVUUHdPMTNxSkJ0ci1PS1VjblpNMTFXbEFSS29PeDhnZXF2My1NSmExLQ</guid></item><item><title>“炎症”如何驱动癌症-指向新疗法-《华尔街日报》 | How ‘Inflammaging’ Drives Cancer—and Points to New Treatments - WSJ</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE5kM3R5OTVkclBveEpFMm50bDdLU1A5cGs2ckpWMlphajZpUFUxbTJUV25xVzIxNE5sREJnWXZ6WEc1RDV3NkNleFFxWll4ZUxDdHd6cGdrejhNVDJJWk9pRzllNEM2MjF0UzlPZm1mRnYteWFVcUdiMGpPVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WSJ</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE5kM3R5OTVkclBveEpFMm50bDdLU1A5cGs2ckpWMlphajZpUFUxbTJUV25xVzIxNE5sREJnWXZ6WEc1RDV3NkNleFFxWll4ZUxDdHd6cGdrejhNVDJJWk9pRzllNEM2MjF0UzlPZm1mRnYteWFVcUdiMGpPVQ</guid></item><item><title>采用MIND饮食可以降低任何年龄段的痴呆风险-神经科学新闻 | Adopting the MIND Diet May Lower Dementia Risk at Any Age - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaEFVX3lxTE10LS1jWFN1Um9QNmlRS3NuTXI3enkxZHVZZC1ETUg1Zk92ZnY3M1pwSkp4WnRMY3h3bEZNS21pWldfOTA3aGZlY1Rja1NZWkNtNEVTRTlqV3lmRnRtVC1CZ1lBaGNzT1Bt?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A large study suggests that following the MIND diet—rich in leafy greens, berries, nuts, and olive oil—significantly reduces the risk of Alzheimer’s and related dementias. Drawing on data from nearly 93,000 U.S. adults, researchers found the strongest and most consistent protective effects among African American, Latino, and White participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who improved their diet over a decade experienced up to a 25% lower dementia risk, regardless of age. While results were less pronounced among Asian American and Native Hawaiian participants, the study reinforces that adopting a brain-healthy diet can benefit cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIND Diet Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Adherence to the MIND diet reduced dementia risk by 9% overall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improvement Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Those who improved their diet over time saw a 25% lower risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subgroup Differences:&lt;/strong&gt; Strongest effects observed in African American, Latino, and White groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;American Society for Nutrition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As the U.S. population ages and dementia cases rise, many people are asking whether it is possible to prevent this devastating disease. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a new study, the answer may be on your plate: People who followed a dietary pattern known as the MIND diet were significantly less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease or related forms of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110604"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb.jpg.webp 656w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb.jpg" alt="This shows food." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb.jpg 656w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mind-diet-dem-fb-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The results also showed that people who improved their adherence to MIND over 10 years (including those who didn’t follow the diet closely at first) had a 25% lower risk of dementia compared to those whose adherence declined. This trend was consistent across different ages and racial groups. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIND diet, which stands for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, combines the Mediterranean diet with the blood pressure-lowering DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet and also emphasizes proven brain-healthy foods like leafy green vegetables, berries, nuts and olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, the MIND diet had a stronger and more consistent risk reduction relationship with dementia than other healthy diets, although the relationship varied among five racial groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who improved their adherence to the diet the most over time showed the greatest pattern of risk reduction. This beneficial relationship was seen similarly among younger and older groups, suggesting that there are benefits to adopting the diet at any age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study findings confirm that healthy dietary patterns in mid to late life and their improvement over time may prevent Alzheimer’s and related dementias,” said Song-Yi Park, PhD, associate professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that it is never too late to adopt a healthy diet to prevent dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park will present the findings at NUTRITION 2025, the flagship annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition held May 31–June 3 in Orlando, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park and colleagues analyzed data from nearly 93,000 U.S. adults who provided information about their diet as part of a research cohort known as the Multiethnic Cohort Study starting in the 1990s. Participants were between 45-75 years old at baseline and over 21,000 developed Alzheimer’s or related dementias in the years that followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, participants who scored higher for MIND adherence at baseline had a 9%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;lower risk of dementia, with an even greater reduction—around 13%—among those who identified as African American, Latino or White. Baseline MIND diet adherence was not associated with a significant risk reduction among Native Hawaiian or Asian American participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the protective relationship between a healthy diet and dementia was more pronounced among African Americans, Latinos and Whites, while it was not as apparent among Asian Americans and showed a weaker trend in Native Hawaiians,” said Park. “A tailored approach may be needed when evaluating different subpopulations’ diet quality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also showed that people who improved their adherence to MIND over 10 years (including those who didn’t follow the diet closely at first) had a 25% lower risk of dementia compared to those whose adherence declined. This trend was consistent across different ages and racial groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers said that differences in dietary patterns and preferences among racial and ethnic groups could play a role in the variation they observed in the dementia-diet relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Asian Americans also experience lower rates of dementia than other groups, it is possible that the MIND diet may not reflect the advantages of diets that are more common among this population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park said that further studies could help to clarify these patterns and added that interventional studies would be needed to verify cause and effect since the study was based on observational data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and brain aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9bf6fefff2fadbf5eeefe9f2eff2f4f5b5f4e9fc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nancy Lamontagne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutrition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Society for Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Nancy Lamontagne – American Society for Nutrition&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will be presented at NUTRITION 2025&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 13:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE10LS1jWFN1Um9QNmlRS3NuTXI3enkxZHVZZC1ETUg1Zk92ZnY3M1pwSkp4WnRMY3h3bEZNS21pWldfOTA3aGZlY1Rja1NZWkNtNEVTRTlqV3lmRnRtVC1CZ1lBaGNzT1Bt</guid></item><item><title>科学家说，在黑死病背后的细菌中发现的基因突变帮助瘟疫征服了世界 | Gene mutation found in the bacterium behind the Black Death helped plague conquer the world, scientists say - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTFA2VGZiOTR6emFON0lqRHRkS1lINUpBVDR4YzFIRU1CLThHaGxWQ0t4cThKUFdPV2cwMlZSbEU5V0N2aXdzYUowRXhqX3hIMURDVkk3SERrWTd4OXRRNDlBR0FZOWFONW9zWmtYYtIBckFVX3lxTFA4VXU4TXl1RVFiZ1ExSlNVMWNvaXluZWpMSGN2Mm9qTFJhQ0lMZmtGeW9DSTZGSGhtcVMwZ0hLMXZsVFh5dUV0T09QbGgxQklSNlZ2eUhEeld5N1V6X04zY3BuZEptbmMwX3FaOElrZkxhdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            One of the bleakest periods in medieval Europe was the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/20/world/plague-bacterium-strain-black-death-intl-scli-scn"&gt;plague pandemic&lt;/a&gt; known as the Black Death, which killed at least 25 million people in just five years. But the disease didn’t stop there. The plague adapted to keep its hosts alive longer, so it could spread farther and keep infecting people for centuries, and researchers now say they’ve discovered how.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10002356mpkwk5wfa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The disease is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which has been circulating among human populations for at least &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7920731/" target="_blank"&gt;5,000 years&lt;/a&gt;. The pathogen has fueled three major plague pandemics since the first century AD, and though its deadliest years appear to be behind us, plague hasn’t disappeared. Cases still occur a few times a year in Asia, South America and the United States and more commonly in parts of Africa,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17782-plague" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, and can be treated with antibiotics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10003356mk3ki7mou@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists are still searching for answers about how Y. pestis evolved and dispersed, but recent analysis of ancient and modern Y. pestis samples revealed how plague managed to persist among humans for hundreds of years after pandemic waves petered out. After an initial period of high infection rates and rapid mortality — killing infected people within three days — changes to just one gene in the bacterium produced new strains that were less deadly and more transmissible, according to research published Thursday in the journal &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt3880" target="_blank"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10004356m9ni2vni9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those weakened strains eventually went extinct; the dominant lineage of today’s Y. pestis is the deadlier variety, the study authors reported. However, these findings about historic instances of Y. pestis adaptation could provide important clues to help scientists and physicians manage modern plague outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10005356m243kon51@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Plague’s most common form is bubonic plague, which causes painful swelling in lymph nodes and spreads among people through bites from fleas hitchhiking on infected rats. An outbreak of bubonic plague from 1347 to 1352 in Europe famously killed about 30% to 50% of the continent’s population. But the earliest known bubonic plague outbreak — the Plague of Justinian — took hold in the Mediterranean Basin and lasted from AD 541 to AD 544. Another plague outbreak emerged in China in the 1850s and sparked a major epidemic in 1894. Scientists view modern plague cases as part of this third pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10006356mgsgt0w2i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the new study, scientists collected ancient samples of Y. pestis from human remains dating back to about 100 years after the appearance of the first and second plague pandemics, sampling remains from Denmark, Europe and Russia. After reconstructing the genomes of these plague strains, they compared them with older, ancient strains that dated back to the start of plague pandemics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbgk8fgi00023b6mp9q524ui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers also examined more than 2,700 genomes of modern plague samples from Asia, Africa, and North and South America. One of the study coauthors, Jennifer Klunk, is a product scientist at Daciel Arbor Biosciences, a biotechnology company in Michigan that provided synthetically created molecules for the experiments, but there was no financial gain associated with the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10007356mbtgwedhl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers found that their newly reconstructed genomes from 100 years into the first two plague pandemics had fewer copies of a gene called pla&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which has been recognized for decades as one of the factors that made plague so deadly, according to the study’s co-lead author Ravneet Sidhu, a doctoral student in the McMaster Ancient DNA Centre at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10008356mtlza671q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pla&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;encodes an enzyme that interacts with host proteins, “and one of the functions that it carries out is in breaking down blood clots,” Sidhu told CNN. This ability helps Y. pestis spread into the host’s lymph nodes, where it replicates before attacking the rest of the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r10009356mgzp0oz8c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Not every function of this gene is fully known,” Sidhu added. However, prior studies by other researchers linked pla to severity of illness caused by both bubonic and pneumonic plague — an airborne form of the disease that affects the lungs, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r1000a356mb1yx7iuh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the reconstructed strains showed fewer  copies of the pla  gene, the scientists were still uncertain      whether that would directly affect how deadly the  disease could be. So they tested strains of reduced-pla&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;bubonic plague on mice, and found that survival rates for this type of plague were 10 to 20 percent           higher in those experiment  subjects than in mice infected with Y. pestis that had a normal amount of the pla&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;gene. It also took the reconstructed bubonic strain about two days longer to kill its  hosts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r1000b356msvxr0j11@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The paper presents a strong argument that depletion, but not total loss, of Pla (the enzyme produced by the pla gene) is part of the evolution of the plague pathogen and may help explain the decline of plague in the second pandemic commonly known as the Black Death,” said Dr. Deborah Anderson, a professor of veterinary pathobiology at the University of Missouri’s College of Veterinary Medicine. Anderson, who was not involved in the new research, investigates the virulence of plague, and these findings could shed light on transmission patterns in modern cases, she told CNN in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r1000c356me2g7o1p6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our laboratory studies the   flea-rodent cycle and we have collaborators who conduct field research in   areas that experience annual or occasional plague outbreaks in the   wild,” Anderson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r2000d356m1mr8wtww@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are nearly 300 rodent species that can transmit Yersinia pestis, and today, burrowing rodents such as prairie dogs or ground squirrels are considered key animal hosts that experience outbreaks of disease,” she added. “After reading this paper, we will pay closer attention to Pla in the future to see if there continues to be a role for its expression in driving the explosive outbreaks of plague in the animal populations.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r2000e356ml4cx4wqn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mathematical models suggested how this might have played out in human populations centuries ago, leading to an “epidemic burnout” about 100 years after a bubonic plague outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbgklmmh00043b6myjmulbtb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a pandemic’s early stages, infections were swift, and death came quickly for both rats and humans. Over time, as dense rat populations thinned out, selective pressures favored the emergence of a less deadly strain of Y. pestis, with fewer copies of the pla&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;gene. Rat hosts infected with this new strain would have a little more time to carry the disease, potentially enabling them to infect more rats — and more people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r2000f356mxaj6cbqt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They  suggest a model that can be readily pursued in the laboratory that may help  explain the spread of plague today in the wild,”      Anderson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            These weaker strains of the disease eventually sputtered out and went extinct. In the modern samples, the researchers found just three examples of strains with reduced pla&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;genes, from Vietnam: one from a human subject and two from black rats (Rattus rattus).
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “We’ve been able to do this really cool interdisciplinary study between the modern and ancient data and marry these things that have been happening throughout (the plague’s) long evolutionary history,” Sidhu said. “It could be interesting to see how future researchers continue to try and bridge that gap between the modern third pandemic and those first and second ancient pandemics, to see other similarities. Because there aren’t a lot of ancient pathogens that we have as much data on, as we do for Yersinia pestis.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r2000i356moygu9gfa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the unusual features of plague pandemics is their persistence, and understanding how Y. pestis changed its infection patterns and survived over time could shed light on the adaptive patterns of modern pandemics such as Covid-19, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbf8s8r2000j356mt9awe594@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even if we aren’t experiencing it to the amount that we were in 2020 or 2021, the pathogen is in the background — still evolving and persisting.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guillaume Raineri, a forty-two-year-old former HVAC technician from Gonesse, a small town just north of Paris, found himself facing an unexpected challenge when he moved to the &lt;strong&gt;United States&lt;/strong&gt;. The food in his new home, Bethesda, Maryland, where his wife worked at the &lt;strong&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/strong&gt;, was different—larger portions, more salt, and excessive sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Curious about the effects of this new &lt;strong&gt;diet&lt;/strong&gt;, Raineri enrolled in a four-week &lt;strong&gt;study&lt;/strong&gt; at the NIH Clinical Center designed to investigate why the American diet leads to such high rates of &lt;strong&gt;weight gain&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;chronic disease&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Controlled Experiment in the NIH Metabolic Ward&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the NIH Clinical Center, the world’s largest hospital dedicated to scientific &lt;strong&gt;research&lt;/strong&gt;, Raineri spent his days in a room fitted with a narrow hospital bed, a blue recliner, and an exercise bike. According to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/01/13/why-is-the-american-diet-so-deadly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, each morning, afternoon, and evening, he was served large meals—around two thousand &lt;strong&gt;calories&lt;/strong&gt; each—and could eat as much as he wished. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;For the first week, his diet consisted of minimally &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/the-worlds-leading-longevity-expert-reveals-four-foods-he-would-never-eat-they-are-a-recipe-for-failure/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="71418" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;processed foods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; like salads, vegetables, and grilled chicken, and he reported feeling well. But as the weeks progressed, researchers switched him to ultra-processed foods—chicken nuggets, fries, and peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches. “They just sat in my stomach,” Raineri said. He experienced heartburn, &lt;strong&gt;bloating&lt;/strong&gt;, and irritability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Throughout the study, Raineri underwent regular metabolic tests, including time inside a &lt;strong&gt;metabolic chamber&lt;/strong&gt; measuring how his body used energy and burned calories. The researchers also tracked his eating speed and &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/every-dog-owners-dream-a-drug-that-could-add-more-years-to-your-best-friends-life/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="71880" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hormone&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;related to appetite. The findings were clear: on the ultra-processed diet, participants like Raineri consumed about five hundred more calories daily, gained weight, and showed metabolic changes including higher &lt;strong&gt;insulin&lt;/strong&gt; and blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Redefining Nutrition: The Role of Food Processing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kevin Hall, the study’s principal investigator and a former physicist turned nutrition researcher at NIH, challenged the traditional focus on nutrients like salt, fat, and sugar. Instead, his research emphasized the impact of industrial food &lt;strong&gt;processing&lt;/strong&gt;. Ultra-processed foods are often chemically modified, containing ingredients that cannot be made in a home kitchen. Hall explained, “We’re starting to learn that processing really matters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This concept, introduced by Brazilian epidemiologist Carlos Monteiro, categorizes foods into four groups based on processing. Group 1 includes unprocessed or minimally processed foods, like nuts and vegetables. Group 4 encompasses ultra-processed products, which include &lt;strong&gt;additives&lt;/strong&gt;, preservatives, and artificial substances designed to enhance flavor, shelf life, and convenience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While critics argue that the category can lump together very different products—like canned beans and gummy bears—the growing body of research links ultra-processed foods to higher risks of high blood pressure, heart attacks, certain cancers, and &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/married-to-an-ai-chatbot-women-opens-up-about-their-deep-bond-and-unique-sex-life/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="80872" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health &lt;/a&gt;issues such as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/24-year-olds-controversial-theory-on-gen-zs-depression-goes-viral-sparking-heated-debate/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="73744" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The effects are often attributed to factors like energy density and &lt;strong&gt;hyper-palatability&lt;/strong&gt;—the irresistible combination of fat, sugar, and salt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Unraveling the Gut Microbiome’s Response&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study also highlighted how ultra-processed foods affect the &lt;strong&gt;microbiome&lt;/strong&gt;, the community of bacteria living in our digestive system. Katherine Maki, a clinician and microbiome researcher working with Hall, described how a lack of dietary &lt;strong&gt;fiber&lt;/strong&gt;—consumed by ninety-five percent of Americans—causes beneficial bacteria like Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to consume the gut’s mucus lining instead, potentially leading to &lt;strong&gt;inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners found in many “no-sugar-added” products can further disrupt gut bacteria, impairing the body’s ability to regulate sugar. This decline in microbial diversity has coincided with the global spread of &lt;strong&gt;Western diets&lt;/strong&gt; and may contribute to broader health problems beyond digestion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Industrial Food Production and the Gray Area of Processing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During a visit to Seviroli Foods’ headquarters an hour and a half east of Manhattan, the production of pasta and sauces illustrated the complexity of food processing. Franco LaRocca, the company’s corporate chef and vice-president of research and development, described how the factory produces millions of pounds of stuffed pasta annually, using enriched &lt;strong&gt;semolina flour&lt;/strong&gt; mixed with ingredients like guar gum and cornstarch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LaRocca noted that while their products are processed, Seviroli limits additives and avoids &lt;strong&gt;hydrogenated oils&lt;/strong&gt;. Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition and food studies at New York University, explained that industrial production alone does not define ultra-processed foods: “It has to have the purpose of replacing real food… and, usually, to be loaded with additives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Nestle emphasized that some products, such as whole-wheat breads made from highly processed flours, fall into the ultra-processed category despite appearing healthy. She compared whole-fat &lt;strong&gt;yogurt&lt;/strong&gt;, made from milk and bacterial cultures, to low-fat versions that include emulsifiers and thickeners, highlighting the nuances in processing and health impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Navigating the Challenge Ahead&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NIH study and subsequent research have sparked debate among nutrition experts. Walter Willett, a prominent Harvard professor and critic of the ultra-processed food classification, described some studies as “misleading” and cautioned against oversimplifying dietary recommendations. Yet, the prevalence of ultra-processed foods in the American diet—estimated to be about two-thirds of what people eat—raises questions about their role in public health crises.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Efforts to regulate ultra-processed food consumption, including marketing restrictions and &lt;strong&gt;taxation&lt;/strong&gt;, are being explored in some countries, but the complex relationship between diet, biology, and the food industry remains a challenge for scientists, policymakers, and consumers alike.&lt;/p&gt;

Women between the ages of 50 and 65 who scored high on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale were 16% more likely to die from any cause, even after adjusting for health and demographic factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This association was not observed in younger or older women. Researchers suggest this may point to hormonal or metabolic changes in midlife that influence vulnerability to sleep-related health effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Window:&lt;/strong&gt; Daytime sleepiness was only linked to mortality in women aged 50–65.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantified Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; High Epworth scores raised mortality odds by 16% in midlife women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings hint at unique hormonal or metabolic factors in this age group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AASM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study to be presented at the SLEEP 2025 annual meeting found that excessive daytime sleepiness is associated with higher odds of all-cause mortality in middle-aged women but not in younger or older women.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results show that the adjusted odds of all-cause mortality were 16% higher in women between the ages of 50 and 65 years who had high scores on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, compared with women who had normal levels of sleepiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman sitting down." class="wp-image-110596" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/day-sleep-mortality-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;According to Maghsoudi, it is noteworthy that there was no association between excessive daytime sleepiness and mortality in older women who tend to have more comorbidities. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were adjusted for age, race, ethnicity, body mass index, and comorbidities. No significant associations were observed in younger women or older women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Identifying middle age as a critical period suggests clinicians should prioritize an Epworth Sleepiness Scale assessment and excessive daytime sleepiness management in women approaching their 50s and early 60s,” said lead author Arash Maghsoudi, who has a doctorate in biomedical engineering and is an instructor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleepiness is a critical patient-reported outcome that is associated with increased risk for adverse health effects and diminished quality of life, according to an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement. Excessive sleepiness is defined as the inability to stay awake and alert during the major waking episodes of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved a retrospective analysis of the medical records of 40,250 female veterans from 1999 to 2022, focusing on individuals who had a sleep disorder or had received sleep-related care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sample had a mean age of 48 years. Clinical notes were analyzed to extract scores on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, a validated natural language processing tool that assesses the likelihood of dozing off or falling asleep during routine daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Maghsoudi, it is noteworthy that there was no association between excessive daytime sleepiness and mortality in older women who tend to have more comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It implies hormonal, metabolic, or resilience factors that warrant mechanistic follow-up for women in middle age,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by funding from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute within the National Institutes of Health; the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness, and Safety, which is a combined Baylor College of Medicine Section in the Department of Medicine and a VA Health Systems Research Center of Innovation funded by a center grant from the Department of Veterans Affairs; and the Michael E.

Samples from the location, which has not been disclosed, were submitted to the Arizona Veterinary Diagnostic Lab for preliminary determination. The results were then submitted to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory for confirmation and received on May 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs produced after the signs of the virus did not enter the food supply, and there have been no signs of illness in humans, officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the risk to the general public is considered to be low, with those most at risk of exposure being individuals who are directly involved with the daily care of birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.abc15.com/news/local-news/poultry-at-hickmans-family-farms-tests-positive-for-avian-flu"&gt;poultry at Hickman's Family Farms&lt;/a&gt; was infected. The company's owners said the farm was placed under quarantine, and measures were reportedly quickly put in place to eliminate the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.abc15.com/news/region-west-valley/buckeye/help-on-the-way-for-arizona-egg-farmer-getting-shelled-by-bird-flu"&gt;ABC15 reported on cases of avian flu at Hickman's&lt;/a&gt;. At that point, the farm said it had lost more than one million egg-laying hens (20% of its flock) at one of its farms due to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sick Bird Hotline: If you see signs of illness in your poultry, report them immediately to USDA at 1- 866-536-7593. You can also contact your local cooperative extension office, local veterinarian, or your State Veterinarian.

Women who drank regular coffee were more likely to avoid chronic disease, cognitive decline, and physical impairment later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits did not extend to tea or decaffeinated coffee, while soda consumption was associated with worse aging outcomes. Researchers emphasize that moderate coffee consumption may be a helpful part of an overall healthy lifestyle but note that genetics and other factors play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine Source Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Only caffeinated coffee—not tea, decaf, or soda—was linked to better aging outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modest Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Each additional daily cup of coffee in midlife correlated with a 2–5% higher chance of healthy aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soda Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; More soda intake was tied to a 20–26% &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; chance of healthy aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;American Society for Nutrition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings from a new study of almost 50,000 women followed for 30 years suggest that a morning cup of coffee might do more than boost energy; it could also help women stay sharp, strong and mentally well as they age.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis found that women who drank caffeinated coffee in midlife were more likely to exhibit healthy aging. However, the researchers didn’t find any links with tea or decaf coffee, while drinking more cola was tied to a significantly lower chance of healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110588"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older woman drinking coffee." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aging-caffeine-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Healthy aging was defined as living to age 70 or older, being free from 11 major chronic diseases, maintaining physical function, having good mental health, exhibiting no cognitive impairment and showing no memory complaints. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While past studies have linked coffee to individual health outcomes, our study is the first to assess coffee’s impact across multiple domains of aging over three decades,” said Dr. Sara Mahdavi, BSc, HBSc, RD, MSc, PhD, a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Harvard University, and an adjunct professor at University of Toronto, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Nutritional Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings suggest that caffeinated coffee—not tea or decaf—may uniquely support aging trajectories that preserve both mental and physical function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mahdavi will present the findings at NUTRITION 2025, the flagship annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition held May 31–June 3 in Orlando.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study has several key strengths,” said Dr. Mahdavi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition to the large sample size and 30 years of follow-up, we assessed several different aspects of longevity and healthy aging as well as very comprehensive information on nutritional and lifestyle habits that were collected every four years after the initiation of the study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 47,513 women from the Nurses’ Health Study with dietary and health data collected since 1984. The researchers assessed caffeine intake using validated food frequency questionnaires that included consumption of top contributors of caffeine such as coffee, tea, cola and decaffeinated coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy aging was defined as living to age 70 or older, being free from 11 major chronic diseases, maintaining physical function, having good mental health, exhibiting no cognitive impairment and showing no memory complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 30 years of follow-up, the investigators estimated how the likelihood of healthy aging changed for every 80 mg of caffeine that study participants consumed per day. They also examined specific drinks like coffee, tea, decaffeinated coffee (per 8-ounce cup) and cola (per 12-ounce glass).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These preliminary analyses accounted for other factors that might influence healthy aging such as body weight, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, education level and protein in the diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2016, 3,706 of the women in the study met all the requirements for being considered healthy agers. In mid-life, ages 45-60, these women typically consumed an average of 315 mg of caffeine per day — roughly the amount in three small cups of coffee or one and a half large cups by today’s standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 80% of that caffeine came from regular coffee consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women in the healthy agers group, each extra cup of coffee per day was tied to a 2% to 5% higher chance of doing well later in life, up to five small cups per day, or about 2.5 cups according to today’s measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers did not find any significant association between drinking decaffeinated coffee or tea with an increased likelihood of healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, each additional small glass of soda—another major source of caffeine—was associated with a 20% to 26% lower likelihood of healthy aging, reinforcing that not all sources of caffeine confer benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results, while preliminary, suggest that small, consistent habits can shape long-term health,” said Dr. Mahdavi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moderate coffee intake may offer some protective benefits when combined with other healthy behaviors such as regular exercise, a healthy diet and avoiding smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this study adds to prior evidence suggesting coffee intake may be linked with healthy aging, the benefits from coffee are relatively modest compared to the impact of overall healthy lifestyle habits and warrant further investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that, in general, up to two cups of coffee per day should be safe and potentially beneficial for most people. Beyond that, drinking more may offer additional benefits for some but may not be healthy for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another study, Dr. Mahdavi and colleagues have shown that genetic variation can influence the relationship between caffeine intake and health outcomes, so more caffeine isn’t always better, particularly for people with lower caffeine tolerance or specific genetic susceptibility (Mahdavi et al, 2023).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, coffee contains a range of compounds that could act synergistically to influence aging pathways. To better understand these effects, researchers plan to investigate how specific bioactive compounds in coffee interact with genetic and metabolic aging markers, especially in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding these mechanisms could guide personalized medicine approaches to develop diets that support longevity and cognitive health for individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2

itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A pharmacist has warned that drinking coffee can be harmful for thousands of people who take common medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes those on thyroid medication, SSRI antidepressants, drugs for &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/adhd/index.html" id="mol-15ba0f90-4072-11f0-8a0e-7dc8da85b0d6"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt; and even over-the-counter decongestants for cold and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html"

increasing the risk of a deadly irregular heartbeat, according to pharmacy expert at Kingston University, Dipa Kamda. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While in other cases, caffeine can interact with prescription drugs, causing a range of debilitating symptoms such as insomnia, headaches, fast heart rate, raised blood drowsiness, confusion, and even stomach bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While your morning brew might feel harmless, it can interact with certain medicines in ways that reduce their effectiveness, or increase the risk of side-effects,' warned Dipa Kamda, writing for &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://theconversation.com/coffee-can-interfere-with-your-medication-heres-what-you-need-to-know-256919"&gt;The Conversation.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'From common cold tablets to antidepressants, caffeine's impact on the body goes far beyond a quick energy boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Coffee may be part of your daily routine, but it’s also a potent chemical compound that can influence how your body processes medicine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caffeine is a stimulant that speeds up activity in your brain and nervous system, she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A pharmacist has warned that drinking coffee is dangerous for thousands of people on common medications &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Popular cold and flu medicines, like Sudafed, contain a decongestant called pseudoephedrine, which also has stimulant properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you combine this with the caffeine in coffee, the effects can be amplified, causing jitters, restlessness, headaches, fast heart rate and insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Combining caffeine with pseudoephedrine can also raise blood sugar and body temperature, particularly important for people with diabetes, &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://theconversation.com/coffee-can-interfere-with-your-medication-heres-what-you-need-to-know-256919"&gt;studies have found&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With many cold medications already containing added caffeine, drinking coffee can increase the risks further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk also applies to those taking stimulant medications to treat ADHD, like amphetamines, or asthma drugs such as theophylline, which has stimulant properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pharmacist warned: 'Using them together may increase the risk of side-effects such as a rapid heartbeat and sleep disruption.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is also added caffeine in some branded over-the-counter painkillers, such as those containing paracetamol or aspirin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking coffee can speed up how quickly the drugs are absorbed and while this helps them work faster, it can be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant found in dozens of cold and flu medicines on the shelves &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'It could raise the risk of side effects like stomach irritation, or bleeding,' said Ms Kamda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[Although] no serious cases have been reported, caution is still advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking coffee while taking some types of medicines to control irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias) or blood pressure is known to make them less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Ms Kamda added those with heart conditions don't have to stop drinking coffee entirely, but may want to 'consider limiting intake or switching to decaf'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you drink coffee immediately before or after taking thyroid medication like levothyroxine, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2020/7909703"&gt;studies have found&lt;/a&gt; absorption of the drug can fall by up to 50 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can cause symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, weight gain and constipation, to return 'even if you’re taking your medicine correctly,' she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is recommended those taking the medication should wait 30 to 60 minutes before eating or drinking coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this is most common with tablet forms of levothyroxine, and less likely with liquid forms, Ms Kamda pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This timing rule also applies to a class of medications used to treat osteoporosis and other bone conditions called bisphosphonates, including alendronate and risedronate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also make the most commonly prescribed type of antidepressant, selective serotonin inhibitors, for example sertraline and citalopram, less effective, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2020/7909703"&gt;lab studies have found.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And drinking coffee with the older and less commonly used tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such amitriptyline or imipramine, can tirgger side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pharmacist, with 17 years experience, explained: 'TCAs are broken down by the liver enzyme CYP1A2, which also metabolises caffeine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The competition between the two can slow drug breakdown, increasing side-effects, or delay caffeine clearance, making you feel jittery or wired longer than usual.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The problematic ingredient in coffee, caffeine, can also be found in a cup of tea, a can of Coca Cola, and even in green tea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pharmacist added: 'Everyone metabolises caffeine differently. Some people feel fine after three cups, while others get side-effects after just one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Pay attention to how your body responds and talk to your pharmacist or GP if anything feels off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you’re ever unsure whether your medicine and your coffee are a good match, ask your pharmacist or doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A short conversation might save you weeks of side-effects or reduced treatment effectiveness, and help you enjoy your brew with peace of mind.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Open your eyes, reach for coffee and sip. That warm first gulp seems to shift your brain into gear. But what if it also helps you stay sharp and strong as you age?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s what new research suggests. Scientists followed almost 50,000 women for 30 years. They found something unexpected. Women who drank regular coffee during midlife were more likely to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organ-aging-can-predict-diseases-decades-in-advance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;age&lt;/a&gt; well – physically, mentally, and emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-drinking-coffee-linked-to-healthy-aging"&gt;Drinking coffee linked to healthy aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on women aged 45 to 60. Researchers measured their caffeine intake and followed their health over the next three decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team wanted to know who would reach age 70 without serious disease, memory problems, depression, or physical decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end, 3,706 women met those goals. Most of them drank about 315 milligrams of caffeine per day. That’s roughly three small cups of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tea, soda, and decaffeinated coffee didn’t show the same &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/our-biological-age-may-predict-dementia-risk-better-than-birth-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt;. But with each extra cup of regular coffee, chances of healthy aging rose by 2 to 5 percent. The benefit topped out around five small cups a day – or 2.5 modern-sized mugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While past studies have linked coffee to individual health outcomes, our study is the first to assess coffee’s impact across multiple domains of aging over three decades,” said Dr. Sara Mahdavi, a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, &lt;a href="https://www.harvard.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mahdavi is also an adjunct professor at &lt;a href="https://www.utoronto.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Nutritional Sciences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings suggest that caffeinated coffee – not tea or decaf – may uniquely support aging trajectories that preserve both mental and physical function,” said Dr. Mahdav.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-all-coffee-helps-you-age-well"&gt;Not all coffee helps you age well&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why coffee and not tea? Researchers aren’t sure yet. Coffee contains hundreds of compounds besides caffeine. Some of those might protect the brain, muscles, or metabolism. Or maybe it’s just the amount of caffeine people get from coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s a twist. Another study led by Dr. Mahdavi looked at how coffee affects the kidneys. This time, the answer depended on your &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organ-aging-can-predict-diseases-decades-in-advance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;genes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this second study, researchers tracked over 600 young adults in Italy. Everyone had early signs of high blood pressure. None were on medication. The scientists also looked at a gene called CYP1A2. This gene controls how fast your body breaks down caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genes-decide-if-coffee-helps-or-harms"&gt;Genes decide if coffee helps or harms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people break down caffeine quickly. They have the AA version of the CYP1A2 gene. Others process it slowly – they have the AC or CC versions. This second group makes up nearly half the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For slow metabolizers, coffee came with risks. Heavy coffee drinkers in this group – those drinking over three cups a day – had a much higher chance of developing kidney problems as they &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/healthy-aging-how-some-people-live-past-100-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow metabolizers were 2.7 times more likely to develop protein in their urine. Their risk of kidney hyperfiltration doubled. The chance of developing high blood pressure went up 2.8 times. Fast metabolizers? No extra risk. They seemed to tolerate coffee just fine, even at higher amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the present cohort study, caffeinated coffee intake was associated with increases in the risks of albuminuria, hyperfiltration, and hypertension only among slow metabolizers of caffeine, suggesting that caffeine may play a role in the development of kidney disease in susceptible individuals,” said Dr. Mahdav.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-habits-shape-long-term-health"&gt;Habits shape long-term health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, this does not mean you should quit coffee. The risks apply mainly to people who metabolize caffeine slowly and drink large amounts. For most people, two cups a day should be safe – and possibly helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results, while preliminary, suggest that small, consistent habits can shape long-term health,” said Dr. Mahdavi. “Moderate coffee intake may offer some protective benefits when combined with other healthy behaviors such as regular exercise, a healthy diet and avoiding smoking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this study adds to prior evidence suggesting coffee intake may be linked with healthy &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/daily-doctor-recommended-regimen-that-could-slow-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt;, the benefits from coffee are relatively modest compared to the impact of overall healthy lifestyle habits and warrant further investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, coffee is not a magic drink. It helps a little. Healthy habits matter more. Still, it’s good news if you already enjoy your daily brew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-a-personalized-diet"&gt;Building a personalized diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mahdavi will present her findings at &lt;a href="https://nutrition.org/meeting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NUTRITION 2025&lt;/a&gt; in Orlando. Her team now plans to study how the chemicals in coffee interact with genes and aging pathways. The goal is to understand who benefits most and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, your genes might help build a personalized diet. One that supports your brain, protects your kidneys, and keeps you moving as you age. Coffee might be part of that plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next time you take that first sip of coffee in the morning, pause for a moment. That warm, familiar drink may be doing more than simply helping you shake off sleep or sharpen your focus for the day ahead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-daily-coffee-might-help-you-age-better"&gt;Daily coffee might help you age better&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to growing research, especially if it is caffeinated coffee, your daily cup might be quietly contributing to a healthier, stronger version of yourself in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before you start seeing coffee as a miracle cure, take a step back. Coffee can support well-being, but it is just one piece of a much larger puzzle. If you want to age well – staying active, mentally sharp, and free from chronic illness – then coffee alone won’t carry you there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to move your body regularly and need to eat meals that nourish, not just fill. You also need to understand how your body responds to substances like caffeine, because your genes play a role in how well coffee works for you – or whether it causes harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy aging doesn’t come from a single habit, drink, or moment. It’s the result of years of daily decisions that seem small at the time. Over the decades, those small decisions build something powerful. Coffee can be one of them, but it is not the only one. Keep choosing well, one day at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blog is based on research presented at NUTRITION 2025 and a peer-reviewed study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2800839" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 12:18:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNNjFrUl9YNVlZcnVwNDBVQ3dRQVlqS05WWDFNcm94RkFrSGZzbUxWbnlad3RNQ2N4RXdiLUtHa1dKMmo2VkxIejR0UXdaY3lqZDE2dG43N0hZTHZEa0h0angza2dYbDJkRy1QcWtQNGhHaWs4bE8wM21PM3FIemJFVTFoVzRObVJ3Unh6TWxXT3lKb3ZRd2Jv</guid></item><item><title>我们终于可以摆脱世界上的蚊子了。但是我们应该吗？ -《华盛顿邮报》 | We finally may be able to rid the world of mosquitoes.

Forget about tigers or bears — it’s the tiny mosquito that is the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/07/01/mosquito-days-malaria-texas-florida/"&gt;deadliest animal on Earth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JTIP26D6ONH7RGHVJPT5TGPWXM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The human misery caused by malaria is undeniable. Nearly 600,000 people died of the disease in 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria"&gt;according to the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, with the majority of cases in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GR7L2UKI6RAPXLLZAN3AASHHTY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On the continent, the death toll is akin to “crashing two Boeing 747s into Kilimanjaro” every day, said Paul Ndebele, a bioethicist at George Washington University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KYPLD6XTRZF4JBP5JDU5F4BKNA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For gene-drive advocates, making the case for releasing genetically modified mosquitoes in nations such as Burkina Faso or Uganda is straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SLWJKLP4GZD7PP7ZMLIHN5NZM4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“This is not a difficult audience because these are people that are living in an area where children are dying,” said Krystal Birungi, an entomologist for Target Malaria in Uganda, though she added that she sometimes has to fight misinformation, such as the false idea that bites from genetically modified mosquitoes can make people sterile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2XZQBMRIENGB3LXAZLQP7CLGKM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But recently, the Hastings Center for Bioethics, a research institute in New York, and Arizona State University brought together a group of bioethicists to discuss the potential pitfalls of intentionally trying to drive a species to extinction. In &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adv4045"&gt;a policy paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Science last month, the group concluded that “deliberate full extinction might occasionally be acceptable, but only extremely rarely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7ZZAHQA3TNEEBIG4MIJBH2W5PQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A compelling candidate for total eradication, according to the bioethicists, is the New World screwworm. This parasitic fly, which lays eggs in wounds and eats the flesh of both humans and livestock, appears to play little role in ecosystems. Infections are difficult to treat and can lead to slow and painful deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DV4AKTIUPVCVPKK5QGGIZ7HYFU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Yet it may be too risky, they say, to use gene drives on invasive rodents on remote Pacific islands where they decimate native birds, given the nonzero chance of a gene-edited rat or mouse jumping ship to the mainland and spreading across a continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YC5UA7CK25EVDEEYEOO6KS5QZI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Even at a microbial level, it became plain in our conversations, we are not in favor of remaking the world to suit human desires,” said Gregory Kaebnick, a senior research scholar at the institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z6I6JGNV4FD27DHGTL6S6D4SBA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s unclear how important malaria-carrying mosquitos&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;are to broader ecosystems.

I pulled out a pair of pajama pants, and the pocket was greasy with two ruptured softgels of cod-liver oil I’d forgotten to remove. The whole load reeked like a cast-iron skillet of seared salmon. I was furious I could be so stupid and careless.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjrq600173b776nkt9al3@published" data-word-count="93"&gt;I’d taken my lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, the generic version of Vyvanse, that morning, just as I had almost every day since I was diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/paris-hilton-adhd-music-video.html"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt; a month earlier at age 35. The first time I swallowed the yellow capsule, I proceeded to paint my home office in two coats of White Dove, the result of a euphoric burst of energy that felt entirely new to me. The morning of the fish-pill incident, though, I felt so tired that I took a nap. I did not feel at all like I’d ingested a stimulant.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjrrs00183b77tfnx6p9x@published" data-word-count="59"&gt;I blamed myself for my low energy and lack of focus. Maybe I hadn’t slept well or eaten enough protein — or something? But a month later, I was again overwhelmed with fatigue, paralyzed by small tasks, and hating myself. And again the month after that. I realized my meds seemed to stop working right before &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/menstruation-full-moon-red-moon-cycle-white-moon-cycle.html"&gt;my period began&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjrtn00193b779hs8h0kk@published" data-word-count="91"&gt;Hormonal fluctuations in ADHD symptoms aren’t rare (on Reddit, a cadre of women commiserate over taking high doses of stimulant drugs that seem to work no better than sugar pills), but the scientific community has been slow to recognize them. One study found ADHD diagnoses in women ages 23 to 49 nearly doubled between 2020 and 2022, and another found a 14 percent increase in stimulant prescriptions for women and girls 5 to 64 between 2020 and 2021. That uptick has likely prompted more complaints about period-related dips in drug efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjrva001a3b77nmieyfbh@published" data-word-count="89"&gt;Although just a handful of researchers are investigating the trend, a theory surrounding it has emerged: When estrogen is high, dopamine (the mood-regulating brain chemical that ADHD meds like Ritalin and Concerta boost) is also high, says &lt;a href="https://www.drellenlittman.com/"&gt;Dr. Ellen Littman,&lt;/a&gt; a psychologist who has worked with high-IQ women and girls with ADHD for more than 35 years. People with ADHD have dysregulated dopamine functioning, so when their estrogen level drops (typically, right before the menstrual bleed begins), they feel the loss of its compensatory effect on their dopamine levels.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjrxb001b3b77dx8ua98x@published" data-word-count="37"&gt;“This is what we clinically see,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eunetworkadultadhd.com/author/sandra-kooij/"&gt;Sandra Kooij&lt;/a&gt;, a psychiatrist working in the Netherlands and the founder and chair of the European Network Adult ADHD. She says doctors can’t measure dopamine, but they can measure estrogen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjs00001c3b77jzdoksej@published" data-word-count="45"&gt;Formal research on women’s hormones and ADHD is scarce. The current theory largely builds on a 2017 study that followed 32 women with regular periods and found ADHD symptoms worsened when their estrogen levels were low. But the vast majority of ADHD research is male-centric.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjs24001d3b77kmm2f4ot@published" data-word-count="99"&gt;This has led to a care crisis for women. Within the medical community, there’s no consensus about who should treat a female ADHD patient with symptoms that present differently depending on where she is in her cycle. These women tell me they often bounce among gynecologists, psychiatrists, and psychologists and are sometimes given additional diagnoses, like anxiety, depression, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. In 2021, Kooij and her collaborators published a study suggesting that women with ADHD experienced more frequent and severe hormone-related mood disorders compared with the general population. “I had to consider, &lt;em&gt;Why is this happening?&lt;/em&gt;” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjs8y001e3b77bkhsh89n@published" data-word-count="76"&gt;Carmen, a 38-year-old mother of three in Michigan, realized her period seemed to be rendering her 40-mg. of Vyvanse ineffective after she saw a TikTok that described her symptoms. She had previously attributed her lack of concentration, short fuse, and exhaustion to her multiple sclerosis and PMS. Carmen’s primary-care doctor has suggested she take a stimulant booster dose on the days she needs it but also  cautioned that there’s not much research to back that approach.&lt;/p&gt;

Every month, she tells me, she turns into “an idiot,” becoming extra forgetful and hot-tempered. “Three kids asking me different things at the same time,” she says. “I can handle it on other days that I feel more clear.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjscj001g3b771j0h3jwa@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;In a 2023 study building on her earlier work, Kooij and colleagues found that increasing the dosage of ADHD meds the week before menstruation improved inattention, irritability, and energy levels for all nine of their research participants. It was a small sample size, but it furthered Kooij’s hypothesis that clinicians could improve women’s symptoms if they treated both their hormonal and their neurological systems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjsex001h3b77agow9lap@published" data-word-count="79"&gt;“It’s important for the treating physician to look at the individual’s needs,” says &lt;a href="https://learningcenter.unc.edu/services/ldadhd-services/burnett-seminars/dr-patricia-quinn/"&gt;Dr. Patricia Quinn&lt;/a&gt;, a retired developmental pediatrician who co-founded the National Center for Girls and Women with ADHD. Some struggle with focus and energy for two weeks before their period, while others notice the problem only for a few days, and still others struggle the entire time they are bleeding. In her practice, she adjusted her patients’ stimulant doses and regulated their hormones with birth control.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of recognizing that their worsening ADHD symptoms may connect to cyclical hormonal changes, women might blame themselves. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jes-fleming-83b277225"&gt;Jes Fleming&lt;/a&gt;, a holistic PMDD specialist, says many of her clients are riddled with shame and guilt, which transform into “negative self-talk, low self-esteem, self-harming behaviors, and suicidal ideation.”&lt;/p&gt;

Months later, she realized her period was affecting her meds. When I call her, she is in the middle of a premenstrual stretch and doesn’t feel like her Adderall is working. She’s also preparing for a trip to her native St. Thomas. “I’m really trying to regulate my mind and body, but my medication isn’t helping the way I need it to right now,” she says. “It sucks because I travel Monday and have so much to do before then.” She also says she’s very sensitive right now, taking everything personally. People aren’t responding to her messages. She just had her room tidied by a professional cleaner, and now, a week later, it’s a disaster again. Aniska says she’s not really upset about the mess. She’s upset with herself for being unable to maintain order.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjsnn001k3b77msqi98vd@published" data-word-count="124"&gt;Self-criticism is common in women with ADHD, and it can escalate into crippling fear and chronic worry. Anyone can launder fish-oil pills, but I constantly make errors — forget I’m doing laundry, create DOOM piles (“didn’t organize, only moved”), abandon side hustles. Those missteps erode my confidence and mutate into intrusive, depressive thinking that stop me from being functional. One of my biggest problems is a fear of my husband dying. Once a month, this passing thought overwhelms me and I play out his death in detail, imagining the make of the car that will hit him, whom I’ll call first. It’s anxiety, sure. But here’s the thing: When my meds work, I don’t ponder his demise. I just think about what’s for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmbfcjspo001l3b77nu7xbese@published" data-word-count="103"&gt;To add to the chaos, there’s still&lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/adderall-shortage-adhd-medication-ascent-pharmaceuticals.html"&gt; a stimulant shortage&lt;/a&gt;, so every month I have to ask my doctor to resend my prescription to multiple pharmacies until we find one that has a 30-day supply of 20-mg. pills. Given this ongoing challenge, I haven’t broached adjusting the dose to match my hormonal dips — or explored whether my health insurance would cover this kind of variation. Plus when I told my doctor that my meds felt less effective around my period, she was a little curious but didn’t have much to say. Hormones, she told me, don’t factor into how she manages treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

But why?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They don’t have an “envelope” (an outer layer of lipids/fats that many viruses have). This outer layer can be disrupted by alcohol, which causes them not to work, Tetro explained. But when viruses are non-enveloped, the alcohol has a harder time getting into the virus, and “it gets repelled.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For bacteria, certain types “can form spores, which protect [them] in harsh environments,” Leung added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Think of spores like a tank, Tetro said. The inside of the bacterium is protected by this strong material on the outside. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Alcohol may do some damage, but simply will not break through all the layers,” he explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/c-difficile/symptoms-causes/syc-20351691" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Clostridium difficile" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e0a44e4b0c2f07d8c7859" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/c-difficile/symptoms-causes/syc-20351691" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clostridium difficile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (which causes the colon to be infected and severe diarrhea) is an example of this kind of bacterium that can survive against hand sanitizer, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/c-difficile/symptoms-causes/syc-20351691" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Mayo Clinic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e0a44e4b0c2f07d8c7859" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/c-difficile/symptoms-causes/syc-20351691" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lastly, some parasites that have a “tough outer shell” are also resistant to alcohol, Leung said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For instance, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cryptosporidium/about/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="cryptosporidium" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e0a44e4b0c2f07d8c7859" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/cryptosporidium/about/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cryptosporidium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which is the leading cause of waterborne illness in the U.S., has a cell wall-like a “bomb shelter” that “fully protects the inside structure,” Tetro explained. Using alcohol “would be like throwing a ping pong ball at it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So when should you opt for hand-washing instead of using hand sanitizer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hand-washing is always preferred when possible, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/soniya-gandhi-2426360.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Soniya Gandhi" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e0a44e4b0c2f07d8c7859" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/soniya-gandhi-2426360.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Soniya Gandhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, associate chief medical officer at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. But it’s important to use “proper technique” for it to actually work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Lather [and] scrub [your] hands to create friction … [Scrub] for at least 20 seconds,” Gandhi advised. “Dry [your] hands thoroughly after washing well because wet hands can more easily transmit germs.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you don’t have access to soap and water, using hand sanitizer is the next best option, she said. Here’s how to use it properly to maximize effectiveness:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Make sure it contains at least 60% alcohol. “These higher concentration sanitizers are more effective at killing germs than those with lower alcohol concentrations,” Gandhi explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Squeeze the appropriate amount of sanitizer on your hands. “Use enough … to keep the hands wet for 15-20 seconds while you’re rubbing,” Tetro said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thoroughly rub it into both of your hands. “Not just [on] the palms but [also] in-between the fingers,” Leung added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do not wipe off the sanitizer. Let it dry on your hands, Gandhi said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just remember that hand sanitizer doesn’t work against all germs. Leung especially recommends washing your hands with soap and water after using the bathroom, before eating and preparing food, after handling garbage, and after coughing or sneezing into your hands. Also, handrubs aren’t effective at removing harmful chemicals or when your hands are visibly dirty or greasy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t forget about these other simple ways to avoid sickness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These tips can provide an added layer of protection from getting infected by germs, including those that are alcohol-resistant:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;When your hands aren’t clean, avoid touching your face. “Surfaces such as [your] eyes and mouth have mucous membranes and easily serve as port[s] of entry” for germs, Leung said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces, like door handles and light switches, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hygiene/about/when-and-how-to-clean-and-disinfect-your-home.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e0a44e4b0c2f07d8c7859" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/hygiene/about/when-and-how-to-clean-and-disinfect-your-home.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.

Specifically, colon cancer occurred at a rate of 3.5 out of 100,000 in men in Uganda compared to 51.8 out of 100,000 in men in Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And I think that’s the first time that it was really noticed that this was a prevention for colon cancer,” noted Quinton. Meaning, it’s &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; important to prioritize your fiber consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways that fiber benefits colon health and even more ways to reach the daily recommended amount. Here’s what experts say: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating enough fiber helps move your stool through your digestive tract.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fiber plays an important role in the health of the colon, and when the colon gets unhealthy, then we’re set up for development of cancer and other inflammatory diseases,” said Quinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, fiber adds bulk to the stool, which helps with proper colon function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Fiber] makes the stools more easy to move along, so the time that the stool spends in the colon is lessened, so less chance for constipation, more normal stools,” explained Quinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also good for the removal of toxins: “If there are any toxins in the stool that lead to cancer, they spend less time in the colon, and therefore lessen the chances of cancer exposure or other diseases,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiber also benefits the microbiome, which is protective against colon cancer, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber is also important for the microbiome, which has been the main focus of research in the past decade, said &lt;a href="https://umaine.edu/foodandagriculture/people/mary-ellen-camire/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Mary Ellen Camire" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="683da2cbe4b08b77a460ce49" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://umaine.edu/foodandagriculture/people/mary-ellen-camire/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Mary Ellen Camire&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of food science and human nutrition at the University of Maine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber is often prebiotic, meaning it’s food for probiotic bacteria, Camire added. And probiotics help &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/14598-probiotics" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="rebuild and balance" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="683da2cbe4b08b77a460ce49" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/14598-probiotics" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;rebuild and balance&lt;/a&gt; your microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the bacteria get a nice fiber meal, they are very active, and they make compounds that help protect the colon” against colon cancer, along with other kinds of cancers, she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;More, the cells that line the colon, which are called colonocytes, get their energy from the microbiome, added Quinton. “And when the colonocytes are healthy, then they form an intact barrier along the colon, so that substances that may cause disease or cancer can’t cross that barrier,” Quinton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also helps the colon produce mucus [and] thick mucus lining also protects the colon, so without enough fiber, our microbiome gets diseased and they don’t produce the energy or nutrients that our colon needs to stay healthy,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: fcafotodigital via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;fcafotodigital via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Beans and legumes are a high-fiber meal.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how you can eat more fiber:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fiber is a really critical part of our overall diet, and the typical American only gets 5 or 10% of the recommended amount of fiber in their diet on any given day,” said Quinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, women need about 25 grams of fiber each day and men need about 38 grams, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beans and legumes are very high in fiber and certain fruits and veggies are, too. Lentils have 18 grams of fiber per cup, black beans have about 15 grams in 1 can, chia seeds have 10 grams in 2 tablespoons, barley has 6 grams in 1 cup, raspberries have 8 grams in 1 cup and a pear has 6 grams, &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/high-fiber-foods" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to the Cleveland Clinic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="683da2cbe4b08b77a460ce49" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/high-fiber-foods" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This summer, you could make a bean and whole wheat pasta salad to up your fiber intake, or make some cold barley salads, said Camire. You can also lean into seasonal produce, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Camire added that it’s important to spread your fiber intake out across the day and to consume different kinds of foods for fiber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The mistake a lot of people make when they decide ‘I’m going to make fiber a priority’ is they don’t give their system time to adjust. If you’re used to eating 15 grams of fiber a day, and you start eating 30 grams a day, the bacteria think they’re having a party and so you may have some gas and cramping,” Camire said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should start out gradually and slowly build up, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once you find the foods that you tolerate well and that you like, getting enough fiber won’t be difficult or expensive,” Camire added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And fiber supplements don’t cut it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to turn to fiber supplements as a quick and easy way to reach your fiber goal, but experts say you shouldn’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“None of the supplements ... are an adequate replacement for natural fiber,” Quinton said. Also, since you need so much fiber, fiber supplements end up being just a drop in the bucket, Camire added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some of the supplements can increase your stool bulk and help constipation, “they don’t necessarily have the soluble fiber elements that feed the microbiome and keep it healthy, which keeps your gut healthy,” said Quinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think you can just replace the fiber with supplements. You need to be eating whole food,” Quinton added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond fiber intake, there’s more you can do to lower your colon cancer risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to also take other preventative steps to lower your risk of developing colon cancer. These include monitoring yourself for concerning symptoms such as ongoing stomach pain, blood in your stool or a change in your bowel movements. If you notice these symptoms, talk to your doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to let your doctor know if colon cancer runs in your family as you may be eligible for an &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/colonoscopy-before-45-signs_l_65f49ae5e4b08b384f1b377f" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="early colonoscopy screening" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="683da2cbe4b08b77a460ce49" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="65f49ae5e4b08b384f1b377f" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;early colonoscopy screening&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the tactile nature of humans and our fondness for stroking and fondling our pets, when we live with animals, microbes from their fur and paws &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23599893/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;have been shown&lt;/a&gt; to end up on our skin – at least temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This has led to suggestions that the "microbiome" could be colonised by bugs from our pets. This is the collection of vast colonies of microbes that live on our skin, in our mouths and most notably in the gut, which hosts a significant concentration of our body's immune cells. According to Nasia Safdar, an infectious disease professor at the University of Wisconsin in the US, this concept has attracted interest from the pet food industry. The idea would be to develop products marketed as promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria in cats and dogs, which might then be transferred to their owners, she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"That angle has been an attractive one for people to fund, because for most of us, it's the human condition that we're interested in," says Safdar. "So what role can the animal play in that?" she asks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Safdar says she is considering running a study which would involve collecting faecal samples from both pets and their human owners when they come for repeated veterinary appointments to see if their guts become more microbially similar with time. She also wants to see if she can identify similar bacterial species which could confer health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lfycfv.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images It’s thought that our ancestors lived in close contact with animals, and this may be necessary for developing a healthy immune system (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;It’s thought that our ancestors lived in close contact with animals, and this may be necessary for developing a healthy immune system (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, others feel that the idea of dog or cat or any other kind of non-human animal microbes being incorporated into our microbiomes is dubious. "There's zero evidence of that whatsoever," says Gilbert. "We don't really find long-term accumulation of dog bacteria on our skin, in our mouth, or in our guts. They don't really stick around."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In response to this, Safdar says that she still feels the study is very much worthwhile, stating she feels it is plausible that gut microbes can be transferred from pets to their owners and vice versa. "It's worth studying and hasn't been closely looked at yet," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Gilbert believes that pets are playing a different, yet equally vital role. His theory is that because our distant ancestors domesticated various species, our immune systems have evolved to be stimulated by the microbes that they carry. These microbes do not reside with us permanently, but our immune cells recognise the familiar signals as they pass through, which then keeps the immune system developing in the right way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Over many millennia, the human immune system got used to seeing dog, horse and cow bacteria," says Gilbert. "And so when it sees those things, it triggers beneficial immune development. It knows what to do," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7058978/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Studies have also shown&lt;/a&gt; that humans who live in the same household as a pet end up with gut microbiomes which are more like each other, and Gilbert suggests that the animal is likely acting as a vehicle to help transfer human microbes between its owners. At the same time, regular exposure to the pet's own microbes will also be stimulating their immune systems to stay more active and better manage the bacterial populations in their own gut and skin microbiomes, keeping pathogens out and stimulating the growth of useful bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;&lt;span id="ancient-microbes" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="ancient-microbes" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;Ancient microbes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is all good news for animal lovers, with research continuing to suggest that living with pets across our life course can be good for our immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;After reading the study on the Amish and the Hutterites, Shanahan was inspired to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0963-8" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;conduct his own research&lt;/a&gt; on Irish travellers, a marginalised population who typically live in confined spaces amongst multiple animals – from dogs and cats to ferrets and horses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Shanahan sequenced their gut microbiomes and compared them with Irish people living more modern lifestyles today, as well as microbiomes sequenced from indigenous populations in Fiji, Madagascar, Mongolia, Peru and Tanzania who still live a lifestyle akin to our hunter-gatherer ancestors.

Researchers at the University of Arizona in the US &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://phys.org/news/2015-03-friend-medicine.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;have explored&lt;/a&gt; whether rehoming unwanted dogs with older adults could help to improve their physical and mental health by boosting their immune systems. And results from an Italian research group which created an educational farm where children from homes with no pets could regularly pet horses under supervision &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771424002283" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that the children's gut microbiomes started to produce more beneficial metabolites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Gilbert says it's plausible that this could be a means of improving childhood immunity. "If you're exposed to more types of bacteria, you are going to stimulate your immune system in more variable ways, which may then improve its ability to manage the microbes on your skin and in your gut," he says. "But you're not being colonised by animal bacteria, that's not happening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Researchers point out that having pets throughout your life can also facilitate more microbial interactions with your immune system in other ways. For example, having a dog makes you more likely to go for regular walks, notes Liam O'Mahoney, professor of immunology at APC Microbiome Ireland, a microbiome-dedicated research centre at University College Cork. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"If you have a pet, you get out and about in the environment and go for walks in the park," says O'Mahoney. "And by doing that, you're also being exposed to microbes from the park, the soil, everywhere which can all be useful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 09:01:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxOekx3cjc0YjFQbFpfY2dJZnpNNlRVMVhqLUVUTkk2QjJvVG56TmlueEVET0NCTWI5ZVY5UVNHT0hfTk5Yb2Nfa0dCNlptUHdrM01vMVk1V3VmWjJRRy1yRUh4aEpRY1MtZ0swNU1sQnRJZVRmbHEzYldBYkwyNVZYRWh5WFJOejd3bFE</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，抗炎饮食可以帮助结肠癌患者延长寿命- NBC新闻 | An anti-inflammatory diet may help colon cancer patients live longer, study says - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwgFBVV95cUxQZ3I0RGI3Z3J0ZHV0UE43WTFibHB2Vkc4VXpBNU9wWkl6NksweF9kdzd0SHVueVRjSkpYRzJJeFcybHNMaU96NW1tOWZSZ00xbW91aTg3WFZ5RmlNa3l1ZmNtWEQ3SU0wZnl2YXRXUWJjRjVoaFhlSVk0RUZXVlBMVy00NHFsc0R1Yk9ZM01QRDBvelpCTjVQUHZrcGNHaUxJMjhrVHlMM2ViaUpaQjExY2NxOTNaYWRObGN1QTBKNXM5UdIBVkFVX3lxTE1MeW5KS2pvOWRuVmoyRDdQQVZzV0IxVDVpVzd1cFJRX1Z6T2tUdDdhRndKUms0cUJnTnRXZGFkNkg4dkxEM2poOFFrZ0RlSnNWOWhzdW1n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Eating food that lowers&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/inflammation-how-protect-body-against-chronic-disease-rcna193856" target="_blank"&gt; inflammation in the body&lt;/a&gt; may help people with &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/advanced-colon-cancer-patients-lived-twice-long-pfizer-combo-therapy-t-rcna209686" target="_blank"&gt;advanced colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; survive longer,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;according to research presented at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The findings, presented Sunday, suggest that cancer patients can have at least some control over the outcome of their disease, even at later stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“This is the most common question that patients ask me when I see them in clinic,” said Dr. Kimmie Ng, an author of the new study and associate chief of the division of gastrointestinal oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. “What is it that I can do myself to try to improve my chances, help me live as long as possible?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Ng’s study — which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal — looked at the diets of 1,625 adults with stage 3 colon cancer, meaning the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, but not to other parts of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;With standard care — surgery and chemotherapy in most cases — about three-quarters of patients can expect to live at least five years after their diagnosis, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The new research suggests diet may influence those odds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“What’s unique about colon cancer is that it’s a cancer of the digestive tract,” said Dr. Sara Char, Ng’s co-author and a clinical fellow in hematology and oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. “What we eat will inevitably go through the colon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;All the patients in the new analysis got the same treatment: surgery, followed by three to six months of chemotherapy.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;They also filled out dietary questionnaires during and after their chemotherapy treatments. Researchers followed up on the participants for five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Patients who regularly ate foods that promote inflammation in the body — ultraprocessed foods, excessive amounts of sugar and saturated fats — had up to an 87% higher risk of dying from their disease when compared to people who ate a far less inflammatory diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/healthy-eating-reach-70-no-chronic-disease-study-rcna197811" target="_blank"&gt;less-inflammatory diet was more plant-focused&lt;/a&gt;, and included foods such as leafy greens, carrots, coffee and tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-a77fa1" class="body-heading"&gt;Real-world examples&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cancer centers have dietitians who work with patients to make sure they’re getting proper nutrition while they’re going through treatment, said Heather Greenlee, medical director of integrative medicine at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle. Chemotherapy, for example, can come with side effects, including difficulty swallowing and poor appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Once treatment is done, patients may need additional help making dietary changes to improve survival long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The issue that a lot of patients face is that people don’t know how to make these dietary changes that are sustainable over time,” said Greenlee, who also wasn’t involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Greenlee heads Fred Hutch’s &lt;a href="https://www.cookforyourlife.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Cook for Your Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;program for people who’ve had cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s really important for big studies like this to be done to show that there is this potential benefit for lifestyle and behavioral changes in the face of some of these cancers that are difficult to treat,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She recommends a plant-focused approach, such as adding beans, broccoli and cauliflower to meals, as well as high-fiber foods. “Those are all good places to start,” Greenlee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-c8be2f" class="body-heading"&gt;Exercise boost&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Patients also boosted their chances of living longer with physical activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People who ate diets least likely to promote inflammation and who did the equivalent of taking a brisk walk for an hour at least three times a week had a 63% lower risk of death from any cause during the five-year follow-up period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/exercise-may-benefit-colon-cancer-patients-much-drugs-rcna209560" target="_blank"&gt;separate study&lt;/a&gt;, also presented Sunday at the cancer meeting, found that regular exercise was linked to a 28% lower risk of the cancer recurring, a new cancer diagnosis or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;More than &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html#" target="_blank"&gt;150,000 people are diagnosed&lt;/a&gt; with colorectal cancer every year, according to the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Not only can healthy lifestyle choices, like diet and exercise, have an impact after a cancer diagnosis,” said Dr. Julie Gralow, chief medical officer of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, “they are absolutely as good as the benefits we see from drugs, and probably even better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxQZ3I0RGI3Z3J0ZHV0UE43WTFibHB2Vkc4VXpBNU9wWkl6NksweF9kdzd0SHVueVRjSkpYRzJJeFcybHNMaU96NW1tOWZSZ00xbW91aTg3WFZ5RmlNa3l1ZmNtWEQ3SU0wZnl2YXRXUWJjRjVoaFhlSVk0RUZXVlBMVy00NHFsc0R1Yk9ZM01QRDBvelpCTjVQUHZrcGNHaUxJMjhrVHlMM2ViaUpaQjExY2NxOTNaYWRObGN1QTBKNXM5UdIBVkFVX3lxTE1MeW5KS2pvOWRuVmoyRDdQQVZzV0IxVDVpVzd1cFJRX1Z6T2tUdDdhRndKUms0cUJnTnRXZGFkNkg4dkxEM2poOFFrZ0RlSnNWOWhzdW1n</guid></item><item><title>心态饮食可以降低痴呆症风险-新闻 | MIND Diet Could Lower Your Dementia Risk - Newser</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQaGlINzRKbFZFLXFYNTk2NjVmODV1S19rTmFicmtRYUV0OWVGZ05KUlZHQmhDZzRYZ0lNWEpfTW1GVDhXUE1pTmxRN2lYRzlGWnk0dUJyejduZWVERjFHbmNSS29ROWRaQjRWeEd6dzBFRDFVZTY3MDFiX1JFRndGSlF6b2Zab2Ew?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="divStoryBodyAbove"&gt;

                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eating your greens—and plenty of berries—could help sharpen your mind well into older age, new research shows. A large, long-term study found that even starting the so-called MIND diet later in life can significantly lower a person's risk of Alzheimer's and dementia, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/aging/mind-diet-mediterranean-dash-dementia-study-rcna209573"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt; reports. Presented at the American Society for Nutrition's annual meeting, research led by University of Hawaii at Manoa and University of Southern California scientists found that middle-aged and older adults who followed the MIND diet—a combination of the Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet, which aims to lower blood pressure—developed dementia at lower rates than those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        Like the Mediterranean diet, the MIND diet is rich in leafy greens, olive oil, and whole grains, but because of its focus on the brain, it gives special weight to foods like berries, which have been linked to brain health. Individual foods are scored based on type and frequency of consumption, with a higher overall score linked to a lower risk of dementia. For example, having two or more servings of berries per week scores higher than having one or none.

                                        Researchers used data from the Multiethnic Cohort, which started in the early 1990s and followed adults from five racial/ethnic groups. At the start, participants who most closely adhered to the MIND diet had a 9% lower dementia risk, with an even greater reduction—13%—for Black, Latino, and white participants. Those who improved their MIND diet scores over a decade saw their risk drop by 25% compared to those who adhered less strictly to it over the years—even if they had not originally adhered to the diet closely, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mind-diet-brain-alzheimers-dementia-study/"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt; reports.

                                        The MIND diet's recommendations include six or more servings of leafy greens a week, daily servings of other vegetables, and limited intake of red meat, cheese, fried foods, pastries, and sweets. Experts emphasize variety in vegetables and note that while the study shows an association, it does not prove causation. Still, the findings align with a body of evidence that Mediterranean-style diets benefit overall brain and heart health. MIND stands for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, while DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension.  (This content was created with the help of AI.

It happens when high blood sugar damages the small blood vessels in the retina, the part of the eye that senses light and sends images to the brain. Over time, these blood vessels can swell, leak fluid, or close off completely. In more severe cases, new weak blood vessels grow and may bleed, causing vision problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, diabetic retinopathy may not cause any symptoms, but as it worsens, you may notice blurry vision, dark spots, or floaters. If untreated, it can lead to blindness. The risk increases the longer you have diabetes and if your blood sugar is not well controlled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 04:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiywFBVV95cUxPNVZMNlBGV0I0ek12bnd1QUhNeWV0SVFkOGJqRkhYTGtmYXAwVVRHMVNoTWdYUDFvZnl0Z29IVTdDMGw0VExRdUpBNjNGaENTVUNWZUdDWVh2eWFDTnoxV1Vid05UUWpSWktpamhUS1hmeVk0b1hjOFR0UkV5YWxZZmRqRTdBMkdDS3kyaC1sSnhZbmFPNVRpVHBpRFl3VVp4b0NxQVZGd1JFRkRUOXhKUXB3YUIxaVRYMldqVnc1bGVqNnhfemtSTlNrdw</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，麻风病在殖民化之前很久就潜伏在美洲- ScienceAlert | Leprosy Was Lurking in The Americas Long Before Colonization, Study Finds - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPYW4wNkxjTE9IWlNlUEpFTTgwN0VCNEVtUWh1Z2QxUzVhcnh2aFdLRHVSbVMzWjhoOVYtUnQxMGFrb1ZHd29WRUhrRG5pNno5M3Bjd3Z2bnE3VmhWUEZyOEdUOThOWnlZeER6aWlFeVhZSHQwUkd5bEZMWEtUZzlTQXVBdHhPSW5TVmlrUzh5N0pXMGJJVFdsUVR6a1l5ZTlnMnBF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Historians have for a long time believed that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy"&gt;leprosy&lt;/a&gt; was introduced to the Americas by European settlers, but the latest research offers strong evidence to the contrary – suggesting that Indigenous Americans had already been dying of the disease for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary cause of leprosy is a bacterium called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_leprae"&gt;Mycobacterium leprae&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and the researchers still think this was introduced to America by Europeans. However, it seems a lesser-known culprit was already established by that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study from an international team of researchers found that another bacterium, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_lepromatosis"&gt;Mycobacterium lepromatosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – a less common cause of leprosy infection – was present in the DNA of ancient human remains from Canada and Argentina dating back at least a thousand years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This discovery transforms our understanding of the history of leprosy in America," &lt;a href="https://www.pasteur.fr/en/press-area/press-documents/revelations-history-leprosy-americas"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; genomicist Maria Lopopolo, from the Institut Pasteur in France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It shows that a form of the disease was already endemic among Indigenous populations well before the Europeans arrived."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt; bacteria was first discovered in a patient in the US in 2008, and since then it's also been found in red squirrels &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_squirrel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sciurus vulgaris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; in the UK. It may well have spread from the US to the UK in the 19th century, the researchers suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In partnership with local Indigenous communities in terms of handling ancestral remains, the researchers analyzed the DNA from a total of 389 ancient and 408 modern human samples. From the results, they put together a genetic family tree of leprosy bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_163305" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163305" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/LeprosyMap.jpg" alt="Leprosy May Have Existed in The Americas Long Before Colonization Introduced It" class="wp-image-163305 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/LeprosyMap.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/LeprosyMap-446x415.jpg 446w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/LeprosyMap-600x558.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-163305" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers tracked leprosy bacteria species across America. (Lopopolo et al., &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though they were thousands of kilometers apart, the ancient Canadian and Argentinian samples were remarkably genetically similar. That points to a rapid spread of &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt; across the American continents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the timeline put together from the DNA, the different strains of &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt; would have split from a common ancestor more than 9,000 years ago. With that many millennia of evolution under its belt, the team says there are likely even more diverse forms of the bacteria still waiting to be discovered in the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are just beginning to uncover the diversity and global movements of this recently identified pathogen," &lt;a href="https://www.pasteur.fr/en/press-area/press-documents/revelations-history-leprosy-americas"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biologist Nicolás Rascovan, from the Institut Pasteur. "The study allows us to hypothesize that there might be unknown animal reservoirs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all adds a valuable extra layer to our understanding of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ancient-texts-suggest-italian-sailors-knew-about-america-way-before-columbus"&gt;the history of the Americas&lt;/a&gt;, and of leprosy. It gives researchers some incredibly useful data points in terms of the progression and diversification of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/in-medieval-england-leprosy-jumped-between-squirrels-and-humans"&gt;the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infectious diseases play an important part in the story of North, South, and Central America, with the arrival of Europeans introducing a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-study-says-europeans-killed-so-many-indigenous-americans-the-planet-cooled-down"&gt;host of new pathogens&lt;/a&gt; that Indigenous communities weren't biologically prepared for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we know that the leprosy part of the picture is a lot more complicated than we previously realized. &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leprosy"&gt;Around 200,000 new cases&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experts-warn-leprosy-isnt-ancient-history-as-cases-surge-in-the-us"&gt;disease are reported&lt;/a&gt; worldwide every year, though it can now be treated and cured with modern drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study clearly illustrates how ancient and modern DNA can rewrite the history of a human pathogen and help us better understand the epidemiology of contemporary infectious diseases," &lt;a href="https://www.pasteur.fr/en/press-area/press-documents/revelations-history-leprosy-americas"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Rascovan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adu7144"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Taking the drug for one to three years was associated with a 10 percent decline in risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were from the Veterans Affairs database, and most were over 50 years old, but researchers said their results suggested metformin could potentially be used to help prevent colon cancer for wider groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Uncontrolled diabetes is a risk factor for the disease, so treating it in general may lower cancer risk, but using metformin may provide additional benefits, as previous research has shown the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13337751/metformin-diabetes-anti-aging-trial.html"&gt;drug has been linked to slowed aging and reduced mortality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Popular podcaster Joe Rogan, 57, who hasn't revealed if he is taking the drug himself, often talks about the medication on his podcast, with expert guests touting its potential longevity benefits.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One guest, Harvard anti-aging scientist Dr David Sinclair claimed it could help to slow aging - and in an interview with Dr Sinclair in 2019, Rogan said: 'I got to find a quack that's willing to prescribe me metformin.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A study suggests that metformin, which Joe Rogan has mentioned repeatedly on his popular podcast, could help to reduce the risk of colon cancer on the left side of the colon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Metformin has been approved for type 2 diabetics but is prescribed off label for a range of ailments. Researchers are also looking at whether it could be used to fight aging&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was revealed at ASCO 2025, the world's largest cancer conference taking place this week in Chicago, Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While promising, scientists behind the paper did not provide an explanation as to why the drug may be protective and said their results needed to be confirmed with more research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Metformin is a prescription-only medication approved for type 2 diabetics to help them control blood sugar levels, with patients taking about two pills per day - sometimes priced at as little as 20 cents a pill. It is estimated that over 19 million Americans are prescribed it each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it is also prescribed off-label for a number of other conditions, including prediabetes and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, a condition in which women experience cysts on their ovaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists from The Jusidman Cancer Center in Israel analyzed data on patients in the Veterans Affairs database from 1999 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They recruited patients on metformin and matched them to patients with similar characteristics not on metformin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These tended to be less healthy patients, which raises the risk of a colon cancer diagnosis or comorbidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the metformin group, the majority of patients had used the substance for at least five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, data was available on the location of the tumor for more than 113,000 patients in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these, 13,691 were in the metformin group - including 9,588 (70 percent) who developed colon cancer on the left side of the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Approximately 100,000 people were in the non-metformin group - including 95,000 (95 percent) who developed the cancer on the left side of their colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Colon cancer is increasingly striking young people. Bailey Hutchins of Tennessee (pictured), died of colon cancer at 26 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers work was published as&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/ABSTRACT483236"&gt; an abstract &lt;/a&gt;by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and has not been made fully available or peer reviewed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, previously published work has found similar benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study from 2019 found metformin was associated with an eight percent reduction in colorectal cancer. By location, it was associated with a 14 percent reduction in the risk of cancer in the rectum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 study looked at the expression of HCT116 cells - those found in colon cancer patients. When these cells grow abnormally, it contributes to tumor progression, but metformin altered the expression of these cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed the medication upregulated genes that may suppress the growth and spread of colorectal cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another 2024 study found metformin use was associated with 'significantly lower' colon cancer risk in both the colon and rectum - about a 30 percent decline in risk.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And an increased protective effect was observed in white people and those with obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers concluded metformin's benefits 'likely generalizes to populations with higher underlying risk.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Bird flu — specifically the H5N1 strain of avian influenza — is deadly and unpredictable, and it continues to evolve in ways that have raised real concerns among virologists and public health experts. Historically, about half the people infected with the virus have died — and unlike other respiratory viruses, it doesn’t spare the young or healthy. The virus, traditionally confined to birds (thus the name), is now spreading more broadly among mammals. There have been large-scale die-offs of seals. More recently, there have been infections among bears, in more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/mammals.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;1,000 herds of dairy cows&lt;/a&gt;, and among the people and animals, like cats, that have come in contact with these cows and their milk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In the United States, dozens of people have tested positive for H5N1, many of whom are workers on dairy farms. One person — a man over the age of 65 from Louisiana — died earlier this year. Globally, the virus has also caused other tragic outcomes, including the death of a&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/mexico-bird-flu-h5n1-4c8a2bc81e565e2948e237c676094415" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; 3-year-old girl&lt;/a&gt; in Mexico and an &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/cambodia-reports-11-year-boy-countrys-fourth-bird-122259228" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;11-year-old boy&lt;/a&gt; in Cambodia after exposure to sick birds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;To date, nearly all known human cases have likely come from direct contact with infected animals or their secretions, such as milk. Many of these kinds of infections — the ones that come from physical contact as opposed to respiratory droplets — can be milder, including pink eye-like symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The virus has yet to spread easily from person to person. That could change, and H5N1 could spread airborne, similar to COVID-19. And if it does, the world could be staring down a pandemic far worse than COVID-19.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;That’s the threat that prompted the Biden administration to invest in next-generation vaccines against H5N1. It awarded a $600 million contract to Moderna — the folks who developed one of the first successful and effective mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines — to develop an mRNA-based vaccine against H5N1. That’s the contract Kennedy has canceled. It’s a decision that defies logic and appears rooted in both a hatred of vaccines and a fear of the mRNA platform. Most importantly, it puts the lives and health of the American people at risk and undercuts years of scientific progress.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;We’ve seen what’s possible when we invest early. The mRNA platform that gave the nation life-saving COVID-19 vaccines was the result of more than a decade of research, much of it funded by the National Institutes of Health. Scientists spent years studying coronaviruses, particularly the original SARS virus, and developed a detailed game plan for a vaccine against that virus. That foundational work gave our nation a head start when SARS-CoV-2 hit, allowing the quick development of vaccines and for Operation Warp Speed, which took place during the first Trump administration, to test those vaccines rapidly. That same foresight was driving the Moderna bird flu contract and research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Developing and refining an mRNA vaccine demands testing and time. Scientists must design and test the antigen, determine optimal dosing, and assess safety and effectiveness — work that takes months and often years. Waiting to develop a vaccine candidate until the world is actually confronting a bird flu pandemic would leave America dangerously behind. That’s why investing in a human vaccine is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/20/opinion/bird-flu-trump-vaccine/#:~:text=The%20virus%20now%20infects%20a,lions%20to%20cats%20to%2C%20most" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;top&lt;/a&gt; things I said the Trump administration must do to combat bird flu. To be sure, the federal government does have a small stockpile of old H5N1 vaccines — but it’s not clear they would work against emerging strains. What is clear is that the mRNA platform could be used to build targeted vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;This is exactly the kind of public health challenge the government should address. There’s no viable commercial market for an H5N1 vaccine — and if we’re lucky, there never will be. We cannot rely on the private sector to invest in pandemic prevention. And waiting to develop vaccines until a pandemic has started is like telling a fire department to start hiring after a neighborhood has gone up in flames.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The rationale behind the contract’s cancellation doesn’t hold up. HHS cited safety concerns with mRNA vaccines, calling continued investment in Moderna’s vaccine “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/health/moderna-trump-bird-flu-vaccine-contract.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;not scientifically or ethically justifiable&lt;/a&gt;.” That’s nonsense. mRNA is a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-mrna-human-cells-covid-vaccines-652839101994" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;naturally occurring molecule&lt;/a&gt; found in nearly every human cell. COVID-19 mRNA vaccines underwent some of the most rigorous clinical trials in history, involving more than &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/safety-efficacy-mrna-vaccines-amid-recent-scrutiny/story?id=122068940" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;70,000 participants&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, about &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cumulative-covid-vaccinations" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;2 billion&lt;/a&gt; of these mRNA vaccines have been administered globally. Yes, they have rare side effects — all medicines do — but their safety profile is extraordinarily strong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;This isn’t just about H5N1. The mRNA platform is a breakthrough technology that can be adapted for a wide range of threats, from emerging viruses to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01151-7#:~:text=A%20phase%20I%20trial%20was,samples%20taken%20from%20their%20tumours." target="_blank" rel=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Canceling a project like this is &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/05/27/opinion/biomedical-research-trump-science-cuts-brain-drain/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;scientific sabotage that undermines years of investment&lt;/a&gt; and slows progress across the board. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The federal government should be investing and working to expand the nation’s scientific and public health arsenal, not shrinking it. The systems we build today — the research, the platforms, the partnerships — are what protect us tomorrow. Canceling this contract undermines progress, weakens readiness, and increases the odds that we’ll be caught flat-footed when the next pandemic strikes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And if that pandemic is driven by a virus as deadly as bird flu, the cost won’t just be measured in dollars — it will be measured in lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Boston Globe</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 03:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxONFdpaWlieHhzdzQ4TmxwbHhJSXVPclB0cUhDVFg3alpWaXFuV3N3dkpGdGg3aTFTT0dzUG1VaVp5XzFSUVRKSGdMNzFqUDdja1dzdzVqUjNPb1h4bE90TE1MdDJ2NUx5aEJUd2FMaUhseWZyY0RCZXBmZG5oY2ozYkJJM1NxV3kwQlNyWTA1SExFYXJXTmtUc3RYdmMtX2ZUSlotQm13</guid></item><item><title>医生一直在说糖不好-但他们错过了这一点-SciTechDaily | Doctors Have Been Saying Sugar Is Bad – But They Missed This - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxPdktvNDFUSGtqVVREcGN6MXlEaWkwRi1OREx1M05yd1VJbUhQTlNENzU2YVFQTEJFRjBJMmNpRlVISHVBdldSZWdpbTN2Z0lELXlPRUlDT3RhdzZqQWVqNVhLT1RtQ3JTWHRuWERoZDh5NDhnaldYd1JPNDFCZFRzTVc2REVCLURXbW5mSg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 02:49:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxPdktvNDFUSGtqVVREcGN6MXlEaWkwRi1OREx1M05yd1VJbUhQTlNENzU2YVFQTEJFRjBJMmNpRlVISHVBdldSZWdpbTN2Z0lELXlPRUlDT3RhdzZqQWVqNVhLT1RtQ3JTWHRuWERoZDh5NDhnaldYd1JPNDFCZFRzTVc2REVCLURXbW5mSg</guid></item><item><title>新的研究表明，食用牛奶可以改善肠道生物多样性，奶酪可以减少某些微生物- Earth.com | New study shows that milk consumption improves gut biodiversity and cheese reduces certain microbes - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxOVTdrdEZVaGFBS1R6dXNTaXNocXExWDZodkZfUXA4ZzhTclYwUkFtN1JxTHRXRFJ2OFRiTndjLWFzLXJDX01neHhBdUNTaG5rYU9reXlwRkw3N1dzMEYtVzQxWFVGMElDSWR6dFNsQ0k2cDFLZVRQeFJIcmdQV3NYRGROVnFMR0FPdHVhVlBabzBMb2FUYVY1eG45blhDRTk0S2RjaUZXUEwzVFhia21taw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milk is a staple in many households. It has long been valued for nutrients like calcium and vitamin D, yet new data hint at another benefit that involves the intricate community of microbes inside the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent findings, led by &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/li-jiao-23845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Li Jiao&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Baylor College of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, shows that milk consumption is connected with an uptick in several helpful bacteria, while cheese may reduce certain microbes important for a balanced intestinal environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-dairy-helps-the-gut"&gt;How dairy helps the gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say dairy interacts with the microbiome, which is the mix of microorganisms in the body that help break down nutrients. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/some-types-of-plant-based-milk-are-linked-to-mental-disorders-like-depression/"&gt;Milk&lt;/a&gt; seems to support a broader range of gut microbes, a sign of a more adaptable gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have explored the role of milk in encouraging the growth of bacteria linked to lower inflammation and improved gut barriers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29590046/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; suggest this trend could relate to the carbohydrate content in dairy, but details remain under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-examining-key-bacteria"&gt;Examining key bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several dairy-linked microbes stand out. One is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10410495/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Faecalibacterium&lt;/a&gt;, known for producing substances that help maintain gut balance and calm inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9300896/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/a&gt;, often mentioned for its &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29902436/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to healthy weight and blood sugar control. Investigators say these bacteria can be more abundant in the gut when milk intake rises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheese appears to bring different consequences by reducing Bacteroides, which are common gut residents that may influence colon conditions. It also seems to lower &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1075996404000071" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subdoligranulum&lt;/a&gt;, a genus thought to play a part in metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have noticed that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/bifidobacterium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/a&gt;, regarded as a probiotic, may increase with certain dairy habits too. This possibility has drawn interest among professionals looking for dietary ways to support digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-yogurt-didn-t-reveal"&gt;What yogurt didn’t reveal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although yogurt is often praised for its probiotic potential, this study didn’t find clear links between yogurt intake and gut microbiota changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s likely because participants reported very low yogurt consumption overall, limiting meaningful analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without enough data, researchers couldn’t determine whether yogurt had the same effects on key bacteria like Akkermansia or Faecalibacterium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More diverse and higher yogurt intake in future studies may be needed to explore how fermented dairy compares to milk and cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dairy-intake-and-gut-health"&gt;Dairy intake and gut health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few researchers highlight that milk has more lactose, which might help raise the presence of healthful &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/bacteria-recreate-an-ancient-war-trick-to-defeat-viruses/"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheese, produced through fermentation, contains less lactose but includes other elements that might shape the gut in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietitians remind people that daily dairy recommendations can differ by age, lifestyle, and health status. Individuals who are sensitive to lactose or prone to certain digestive concerns might need to choose their dairy products carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some nutrition &lt;a href="https://www.myplate.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; in the United States advise around three cups of dairy daily, although personal needs vary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many folks fall short of this amount, which leaves a door open for considering how milk or cheese might add microbial variety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-dietary-guidelines"&gt;Future dietary guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health experts caution that these findings shouldn’t lead to broad assumptions about all dairy products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved a small group of older men, and their average dairy intake was lower than national averages, so the results may not apply to other groups or dietary patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the research adds weight to calls for more personalized dietary advice. Instead of focusing only on dairy quantity, future guidelines might need to emphasize the type of dairy product and its effects on gut &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mysterious-bacteria-found-on-chinese-space-station-has-never-been-seen-before/"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; balance and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limits-of-small-scale-research"&gt;Limits of small-scale research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included only 34 participants, most of whom were older men. This limited sample size makes it hard to apply the findings to younger people, women, or more diverse populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the reliance on self-reported food frequency questionnaires introduces some uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People don’t always remember their food habits accurately, which can affect how well their dairy intake matches up with microbiome changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dairy-gut-health-and-the-future"&gt;Dairy, gut health, and the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies increasingly point to the idea that food choices affect more than just basic nutrition. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/most-americans-dont-know-the-dangers-of-raw-milk-and-bird-flu/"&gt;Milk&lt;/a&gt; consumption, in particular, is now tied to the presence of microbes that could protect against a variety of gut-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dairy consumption may influence host health by modulating the structure and composition of the colonic adherent gut microbiota,” said Dr. Jiao. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader health connection is an active topic, and future efforts may include trials that examine long-term changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers plan to learn more about how each type of dairy modifies these microorganisms in people of different ages and backgrounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also want to understand the range of nutrients, such as calcium or protein, that might work alongside gut microbes to keep digestion running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/3/567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 02:27:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxOVTdrdEZVaGFBS1R6dXNTaXNocXExWDZodkZfUXA4ZzhTclYwUkFtN1JxTHRXRFJ2OFRiTndjLWFzLXJDX01neHhBdUNTaG5rYU9reXlwRkw3N1dzMEYtVzQxWFVGMElDSWR6dFNsQ0k2cDFLZVRQeFJIcmdQV3NYRGROVnFMR0FPdHVhVlBabzBMb2FUYVY1eG45blhDRTk0S2RjaUZXUEwzVFhia21taw</guid></item><item><title>德克萨斯州妇女用受感染的自来水冲洗鼻窦后死亡—以下是如何保护自己的安全-纽约邮报 | Texas woman died after rinsing sinuses with infected tap water — here’s how to keep yourself safe - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxNamM0NENWUDdIQzV5NEpXVlFfVHIwWFpwazY2ekJKNmo1QUN6a2Z3WDU3X2duQUR2VjdUNEtqYXFtRnlZN2VOcGRQbWVrWEtzTU80U3BlZzhFWXJtYTNEZ1JDeTNGOEF4b2UyOV9Sd2x4Umh0cS1BcTM4ckRjV2dXQ2xLLXJQdXRrZS10NE55Qjc2aTVKaEtfT1RRc1FhZlBkYjVpUUdR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;A 71-year-old woman reportedly contracted a brain infection from using tap water — and died from it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether tap water is safe to consume where you live, experts advise against letting it go into your sinuses —  or you risk being exposed to a brain-eating condition, like this unidentified woman.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, if water contains amoeba — single-celled organisms — and it gets into a person’s nose, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/01/fl-person-dies-after-catching-brain-eating-amoeba-report/"&gt;it can travel to the brain and cause the fatal infection&lt;/a&gt;, commonly known as “brain-eating amoeba” but the technical term for it is Naegleria fowleri, which is what most likely happened to this woman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Texas Department of State Health Services claims that the sink water in the area is safe to consume, they believe the woman rinsed her sinuses from an RV’s water system at a campground and was infected by &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/10/13/lake-mead-officials-warn-of-rare-but-deadly-brain-eating-amoeba-found-present-in-hot-springs/"&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/a&gt;, as explained by the &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14773767/woman-Texas-dies-brain-eating-infection-naegleria-fowleri.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condition — typically found in warm water lakes and rivers — is rare, but it’s deadly — killing almost 97% of people who contract it. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/state-map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The CDC reported&lt;/a&gt; 157 confirmed cases in the nation between 1962 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And reportedly, Texas is one of the few US states that has the largest number of amoeba cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to Texas, Florida has also fallen victim to this terrifying infection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2023, a Florida woman contracted the brain-eating infection the same way the Texas woman did — and died from it.&lt;/p&gt;

885px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Experts recommend a few different ways to avoid possibly getting infected with this condition.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The adult patient reportedly performed nasal rinsing daily with unboiled tap water, which is thought to be the source of the infection,” the CDC said in a statement to &lt;a href="https://www.fox4now.com/charlotte-county/is-charlotte-countys-tap-water-safe-following-report-of-amoeba-infection"&gt;Fox 4. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24485-brain-eating-amoeba" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of Naegleria fowleri start to show up about 15 days after a person has been exposed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They can range from a mild fever, headache, nausea and vomiting — to more severe ones like a stiff neck, confusion, lack of attention, loss of balance and seizures. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, once a person has been exposed and severely infected — even with treatment, most will die from it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regardless of where someone lives and the quality of their area’s tap water — to avoid any potential exposure to this serious condition, experts recommend boiling water before rinsing sinuses with it or using distilled water, avoid going underwater in a bathtub or freshwater.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also recommended to supervise children playing with sprinklers, and if you haven’t been home in a few days, let water run for several minutes in sinks or showers to flush out stagnant water. &lt;/p&gt;

In the first stage, symptoms include a runny nose, cough and slight fever. The eyes may become red and sensitive to light while the fever rises each day. The second stage begins between three and seven days after symptoms start, with temperatures reaching 103 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit and a red blotchy rash that lasts between four to seven days. The rash typically starts on the face before spreading to the shoulders, arms and legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Measles is a highly contagious viral disease and spreads through the air from an infected person," Dr. Joshua Clayton, state epidemiologist, told ABC News. "Individuals who lack immunity from vaccination or past infection are at high risk of measles infection if they have contact with an infected person."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;According to state health officials, the measles vaccine offers the best protection against infection. People are considered immune to measles if they were born before 1957, received one dose of the measles vaccine (MMR) as an adult, received two doses of the measles vaccine (MMR) as a child or high-risk adult, have measles antibodies shown by a lab test, or had a previous measles infection confirmed by a lab test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The Department of Health notes that the MMR vaccine is typically given at 12 to 15 months of age, with a second dose at four to six years.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE — The Washington Department of Health (DOH) said Monday it has detected a new &lt;a href="/coronavirus-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; variant in the state.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the DOH, health officials found 14 sequenced detections of NB.1.8.1 in Washington state. The earliest detection of the new variant was found April 7 and the most recent case is from May 20. Thirteen of the detections were found from the CDC &lt;a href="%7C36df3a36f9bd45616bed08dda20eb12e%7Cccd8a79b7268413b878971f8b6f4c0df%7C1%7C0%7C638844906938479814%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ==%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=UGAsCZG1hy2fQgX5ajvOjsrfrERSQ3phzKKK%2FBqYPBg=&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" title="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3a%2f%2fcovid.cdc.gov%2fcovid-data-tracker%2f%23traveler-genomic-surveillance&amp;amp;data=05%7c02%7ckgilbert%40king5.com%7c36df3a36f9bd45616bed08dda20eb12e%7cccd8a79b7268413b878971f8b6f4c0df%7c1%7c0%7c638"&gt;Traveler Genomics Program&lt;/a&gt;, which tests samples from the SEA Airport. The other instance was submitted by the U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the detections were confirmed in Washington state, health officials said in a Monday release they could not determine if the people tested are residents of Washington or if they spent time in the state after the sample was collected.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) considers NB.1.8.1 a variant because it is rising in frequency in regions where it has been detected. The organization said the public health risk posed by the variant is low. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data does not indicate that the variant causes more severe disease than its predecessors, according to the WHO. Health officials believe the current vaccine strains are expected to protect against symptomatic and severe disease for NB.1.8.1.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington DOH urged all eligible residents to stay up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON — What began as an international journey from Turkey to Mexico turned into a race against time last Friday when a 35-year-old woman suffered a mid-flight medical emergency. Thanks to quick-thinking passengers, a skilled doctor on board, and the coordinated efforts of Houston-area medical teams,  Maricela Hernandez Quezada is alive and on the road to a full recovery.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the flight, Hernandez Quezada began showing signs of distress. A doctor  who was also a passenger on the flight recognized the symptoms of a stroke and sprang into action.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doctor administered oxygen, monitored her condition and alerted the flight crew to the severity of the emergency, according to Memorial Hermann Hospital. The plane diverted for an unscheduled stop at Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"She was found to be weak and paralyzed on the right arm, right leg completely, as well as having trouble with her speech, where she could not comprehend what was being told to her," said Dr. Haris Kamal with Memorial Hermann Northeast. "And in terms of output of speech, she was having a word salad, or the wrong words were coming out jumbled up."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was kind of in shock because I knew, it was I like I was healthy and I don't smoke. I don't drink. And I thought, ‘Wow, how is this possible,’” Hernandez Quezada said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paramedics met the aircraft on the tarmac and rushed Hernandez Quezada to Memorial Hermann Northeast Hospital. There, she was stabilized before being flown by Life Flight to Memorial Hermann in The Woodlands, where a team was already preparing for surgery.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the emergency procedure, Hernandez Quezada was paralyzed on her right side and unable to speak. After the successful removal of a life-threatening brain clot, she is now walking, talking, and is expected to make a full recovery.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kamal removed the clot with a catheter inserted in her leg. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I expect her to continue this trajectory of improvement to hopefully being near normal or normal in a few months’ time, where anyone who would be speaking with her would probably not be able to tell that she had literally just been through a major neurological event,” Kamal said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What caused Hernandez Quezada's stroke?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kamal said in this case, the long plane ride with Hernandez Quezada not staying hydrated and not getting up to stretch most likely resulted with a blood clot in her leg that traveled to her brain. She easily could have died.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I feel blessed because all the doctors and nurses that have care of me,” she said. “And I just feel like a new person.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do you know the signs of a stroke? Familiarize yourself with B.E. F.A.S.T&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signs of a stroke are not that hard to remember, especially if you remember the word "B.E. F.A.S.T."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"B.E. F.A.S.T." is a helpful acronym. It’s the signs of a stroke and knowing them could potentially be lifesaving. It stands for:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

The medication that had formerly cost him less than $70 at his Appleton, Wisconsin pharmacy was now priced at more than $500, according to Cole’s father, Bil Schmidtknecht. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Stunned, Cole left the store with a medication designed to stop asthma attacks once they start, but without the Advair Diskus inhaler he needed to prevent attacks from happening in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Five days after his pharmacy visit last year, Cole had a severe asthma attack, stopped breathing and collapsed.

It’s designed to work this way. It’s just hurting us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Schmidtknechts are pushing for legislation that would require a 90-day warning when an insurance company’s formulary is changed. They are also suing Optum Rx, the PBM that took Cole’s Advair Diskus off his insurance company’s formulary, and Walgreens, his pharmacy, which, the Schmidtknechts say, didn’t offer Cole a way to control his asthma while another solution could be found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The lawsuit claims that Cole did not get the required 30 days’ notice of the change, that his doctor wasn’t contacted and that the pharmacy didn’t provide Cole with any more affordable options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Schmidknechts said Cole left the pharmacy with only a &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000008.htm" target="_blank"&gt;rescue inhaler&lt;/a&gt;, which is used for quick relief. But that type of medication by itself isn’t strong enough to keep someone out of the emergency room if the asthma attack is severe, Dr. David Bernstein, an immunologist who is a professor in the division of immunology, allergy and rheumatology at the University of Cincinnati, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It was empty at his house, next to his bed,” Bil said of the emergency inhaler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In a motion to dismiss the Schmidkneckt’s lawsuit, Optum Rx expressed “its deepest sympathies” for Cole’s death and said federal law prohibits the case from being brought in state court. Optum also said three alternatives, each with a $5 copay, were available, and its system instructed Walgreens to contact Cole’s doctor about those options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Walgreens also offered “its deepest sympathies and cited privacy for why it can’t discuss specifics in the case. In a statement, it added, “In general, in cases where a medication is not covered by insurance, pharmacy staff may work with the plan, patient, and/or prescriber in an effort to process and dispense the prescription if able.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cole would be 24 now. When speaking about all the things he could have been doing, his parents nearly break down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“He was just so young, and he had his whole life ahead of him,” Shanon said. “And it was so preventable and so unnecessary.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For the Schmidkneckts, it's about policy change. “Justice for Cole, of course, but bigger than that, justice for us all,” Shanon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Getting that change won’t be easy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In the U.S., just three PBMs process 80% of prescriptions. And a big part of the PBM formulary playbook is secrecy, Anderson said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-8dfd42"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/250530-schmidtknecht-family-wm-524p-b84842.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250530-schmidtknecht-family-wm-524p-b84842.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/250530-schmidtknecht-family-wm-524p-b84842.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250530-schmidtknecht-family-wm-524p-b84842.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250530-schmidtknecht-family-wm-524p-b84842.jpg" alt="Cole Schmidtknecht"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Cole Schmidtknecht.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Schmidtknecht Family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That way, patients don’t learn how PBMs make their decisions about drugs and why a medication that had been on the formulary no longer is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Often no one, from the patients to the drug companies to the insurers, is aware of the details of the decisions the PBMs are making. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They do not share this information widely, as it is considered a trade secret,” Anderson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The deals are “a negotiation between the drug companies and the PBM,” Anderson said. “The drug company wants their drug on the formulary in a favorable position. The PBM wants to get the largest possible rebate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The “rebate” is the difference between the list price for a drug and what the PBM can buy it for, which can be “a very much lower number than the list price,” Anderson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When there are multiple drugs that do essentially the same thing, then there’s a bidding war, usually a silent one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The rewards for the PBMs can be huge. A &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/ftc-releases-second-interim-staff-report-prescription-drug-middlemen" target="_blank"&gt;Federal Trade Commission report&lt;/a&gt; released in January found that, over the past few years, the three biggest PBMs — CVS Health Caremark Rx, Cigna’s Express Scripts and UnitedHealth Group’s Optum Rx — inflated the costs of numerous life-saving medications by billions of dollars. The companies countered that the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/top-three-insurers-reaped-73-billion-drug-middlemens-markups-ftc-says-rcna187640" target="_blank"&gt;FTC report’s conclusions were misleading.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In January, CVS Health said in a statement that it “is inappropriate and misleading to draw broad conclusions from cherry-picked ‘specialty generic’ outliers” and that the company’s “top priority is to make health care more affordable.” OptumRx said that it helped eligible patients save $1.3 billion last year and estimated that the median out-of-pocket payment for these patients was $5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;To remember Cole, both his parents had a tattoo just like his inked onto their wrists. When they feel overwhelmed they glance down at it to remember the change they want to make in his honor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s just everyone’s little reminder, you know, from Cole to just keep living and that we can still be happy,” Shanon said. “I keep trying to remind myself that happiness and joy and grief can co-exist.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We're reporting in depth on the systems surrounding our health care and insurance industries.

&lt;h2&gt;“Quite impressive”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exercise group, which had supervised exercise for the first six months of the three-year intervention, reported more exercise over the study. At the end, the exercise group was averaging over 20 MET hours per week, while the education group's average was around 15 MET hours per week. The exercise group also scored better at cardiorespiratory fitness and physical functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, with the health education, the control group also saw a boost to their exercise during the trial, with their average starting around 10 MET hours per week. These findings "raise the possibility of an even more powerful effect of exercise on cancer outcomes as compared with a completely sedentary control group," the researchers note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, it's not entirely clear how exercise keeps cancers at bay, but it squares with numerous other observational studies that have linked exercise to better outcomes in cancer patients. Researchers have several hypotheses, including that exercise might cause "increased fluid shear stress, enhanced immune surveillance, reduced inflammation, improved insulin sensitivity, and altered microenvironment of major sites of metastases," the authors note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, exercise seemed to keep local and distant colon cancer from recurring, as well as prevent new cancers, including breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside experts hailed the study's findings. "This indicates that exercise has a similarly strong effect as previously shown for chemotherapy, which is really quite impressive," Marco Gerlinger, a gastrointestinal cancer expert at Queen Mary University of London, said in a statement. "One of the commonest questions from patients is what they can do to reduce the risk that their cancer comes back. Oncologists can now make a very clear evidence-based recommendation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Having worked in bowel cancer research for 30 years, this is an exciting breakthrough in the step-wise improvement in cure rates," David Sebag-Montefiore, a clinical oncologist at the University of Leeds, said. "The great appeal of a structured moderate intensity exercise is that it offers the benefits without the downside of the well-known side effects of our other treatments."&lt;/p&gt;

Those who had consumed most carbohydrates of the highest nutritional quality — including whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes — were up to 37 per cent more likely to age healthily than those who reported consuming the lowest intakes of wholesome carbs. Predictably, higher intakes of ultra-processed and refined carbs had a negative effect, resulting in 13 per cent worse odds of healthy ageing. “Refined carbohydrates, which included carbohydrates from added sugars, refined grains, and [white] potatoes, were unfavourably associated with healthy ageing,” Ardisson Korat says. “Minimising the intake of those carbohydrates is related to better healthy ageing outcomes.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Carbohydrates have unfairly taken a bashing, but this new study reinforces that high-quality carbohydrates are essential for gut health and healthy ageing,” says the dietician Bahee Van de Bor, a spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association. “They provide a valuable source of both soluble and insoluble fibre, as well as key vitamins and minerals that support digestion, metabolic health, immune function and beyond.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Eli Brecher, a registered nutritionist, says that carbs should ideally be combined with a source of protein and healthy fats in order to create a balanced meal that supports stable blood sugar and keeps you feeling full. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So which carbs should we be eating more of? We all know the benefits of wholegrain carbs and that boosting our intakes of foods such as porridge, rye bread and brown rice is a good move. But here are 13 carbs you might want to consider eating more of, according to the experts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.6"&gt;&lt;div id="e167ea5e-1cd6-412e-9345-ee38635b0a01"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Pears lower your risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;1. Pears&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Studies have linked pear consumption to a reduced risk of heart disease and, thanks to the high levels of beneficial phenolic compounds found particularly in the skin of the fruit, to a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. Pears are also one of the foods rich in flavonoids that have been associated with a healthy gut microbiome and as having a positive effect on blood pressure levels in studies by Aedín Cassidy, professor in nutrition and preventive medicine at Queen’s University in Belfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;2. Pasta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Researchers at the University of Minnesota who reviewed 38 published studies on pasta intake for a paper in the journal Nutrients confirmed that even white pasta “does not hinder weight loss or contribute to weight gain”. According to the authors, pasta is made in a way that causes the carbohydrates to digest slowly in the body when cooked, giving a much lower glycaemic response than, say, white bread. Cooling cooked pasta first also produces a lower blood sugar spike. “For added fibre, pasta made from wholewheat or legume flours such as red lentil pasta are good options,” Brecher says. “Pasta offers sustained energy with a low glycaemic impact to keep you going.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.11"&gt;&lt;div id="f1d465aa-6b09-4057-835f-1515a02cfdbd"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Red rice is a provider of protein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;3. Red rice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A nutritional analysis of red rice, sold in many supermarkets, in the journal Molecules last year revealed it has an 87.2 per cent carbohydrate content, provides some protein and also contains the beneficial plant compounds flavan-3-ols “which may provide biological benefits to human health”, according to the researchers. “Red rice is a deep red whole grain, its colour indicating it is packed with a unique spectrum of antioxidants and more so than regular brown rice,” says Dr Linia Patel, a researcher in the department of clinical sciences and community health at the Università degli Studi di Milano in Italy, and a spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;4. Raspberries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Raspberries are an overlooked berry and yet, high in fibre and polyphenols, they can “help to reduce inflammation and support a healthy gut”, Brecher says. In one study, 59 overweight participants with belly fat obesity were asked to either consume 280g a day of frozen raspberries or to stick to their usual diet for two months. Results showed the raspberry-rich diet to have positive effects on immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;5. Red kidney beans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“These are one of my favourite carb sources as great in salads and in place of meat in sauces,” Brecher says. “They are packed with plant-based protein, iron and resistant starch that feeds our gut bacteria.” Darker-coloured beans such as red kidney beans and also black beans might help to maintain blood vessel health too. Researchers from the University of Manitoba in Canada showed that blood pressure was lower two hours after eating red kidney beans compared with rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/sugar-consumption-healthy-advice-analysis-foods-q95nrjqq2" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How much sugar are you really eating?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;6. Lentils&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Patel says that fibre-packed pulses and legumes should be a carb staple in our diets and that lentils, with a good iron content, are “also the protein powerhouse of the legume family”. For a study she published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Patel showed that eating just one 40g portion of dried pulses or legumes (about three tablespoons when cooked) per week decreases the risk of colon cancer by 21 per cent compared with those who ate none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;7. Kiwi fruit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Two kiwis are packed with 5g of fibre, which is 16 per cent of your recommended daily amount,” Patel says. The green flesh of the furry-skinned fruit contains tiny amounts of the hormone melatonin, which plays a role in circadian rhythm regulation and scientists have shown that eating a couple before bed might improve sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;8. Figs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Sweet from naturally occurring sugar and rich in calcium, potassium and prebiotic fibre, figs help to nourish gut bacteria,” Brecher says. “As a source of vitamin K1, they also help to support bone health.” Figs are packed with a plant hormone called abscisic acid, which helps to manage the body’s blood glucose response. A study in Diabetes journal showed that 100-200mg of fig extract lowered blood sugar within 30-120 minutes. And eating more fresh or dried figs might help to reduce blood sugar levels by up to 13.5 per cent in eight weeks, according to a review by food scientists at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/how-to-have-a-healthy-brain-dxpg2mbtb" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nine ways to keep your brain healthy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;9. Broccoli&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;About seven per cent of the total weight of broccoli is carbs and it is a great standby, Van de Bor says. As a member of the cruciferous vegetable family, she says it also contains powerful compounds called glucosinolates that are broken down to form biologically active compounds that are known to have health benefits such as preventing damaging oxidative stress in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;10. Quinoa &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Quinoa provides fibre, iron, B vitamins and good amounts of protein as well as valuable carbohydrates,” Brecher says. “Technically a seed, quinoa is a complete plant protein and is naturally gluten-free, so a good option for those avoiding common grains like wheat, barley and spelt.” In a 2024 review in Frontiers in Nutrition journal, researchers from China reported that quinoa is also rich in active ingredients such as flavonoids, saponins, peptides and polysaccharides, which may help to regulate blood sugar, lower cholesterol levels and also have an anti-inflammatory effect on the body, all of which are helpful in the prevention of heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.32"&gt;&lt;div id="c08f9367-cd58-470c-9e67-3f10ea1ce4fd"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Red cabbage can reduce your risk of cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;11. Red cabbage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“This is a tremendous carb-loaded vegetable as it keeps for ever in the fridge, ready to supercharge any salad,” Patel says. “It is loaded with anthocyanins — the “daddy” of polyphenols — which give it its purple colour.” The US Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service identified 36 anthocyanins in red cabbage, which have been shown in some studies to provide cancer protection, improve brain function and promote heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;12. Green peas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Don’t ignore common green peas as a source of carbs in the diet. “They are a valuable sweet, starchy veg that pack a punch in terms of fibre that might help with blood sugar control,” Patel says. They also contain vitamin K1 for bone strength and help with healthy blood clotting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;13. Butter beans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Add butter beans to your salads and casseroles as their carb and fibre content will fill you up — and more. “Butter beans provide manganese, a trace mineral involved in antioxidant defence, bone formation and energy metabolism — all important in supporting healthy ageing,” Van de Bor says. “They are also a source of folate, which supports normal cell division, red blood cell formation and helps reduce homocysteine levels — a factor linked to cardiovascular health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQeU1HWXV3Z25keHo5ZEtPemRiOFh3TXRZc0dMMjk4bUNlTDRGOVFsRDBPcllsTjZ2Q25GWnRpQkJJbmtKd0huMzgzd1hKbmtYZU5uWHZVU2NtYU1hTUtNMG4wbENNcU13WW1ydXRaM08zVzR3RUw4Z0Q3S1JBOTg2VWZONFBHMWhYb3FCTmVod3JVemRMZ056TnJ2RGU</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法， 5个鬼鬼祟祟的迹象表明您的血糖太低- EatingWell | 5 Sneaky Signs Your Blood Sugar Is Too Low, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxNaWFCZ0Z5bHN1bTl5RW9NTVNMSXZhZTBtZ2M4Nmk4M1didlhFYTE0Q3dnLTRNSnZ5VHllS2RyX2RCVGFXMWpvcUd6ODhVVHhqYXJjeDVWT21ZZVE4YW9vbkZ1UWo3UHVPNG5lakdHTjFYWWJvNVFyZEtIZDJnUFpSSThR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everyone’s blood sugar goes up and down somewhat. But for some people, it can fall too low.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, occurs when blood glucose drops below 70 mg/dL.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because low blood sugar has many symptoms, it’s not always easy to recognize.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your body and brain run on glucose for fuel. So, when blood sugar drops, it can feel like things have come to a grinding halt. This is your body’s way of telling you, “Hey, I need help—stat!” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Medically speaking, low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, is when blood sugar falls below 70 mg/dL.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  It most commonly occurs in people with type 1 diabetes. “Low blood sugar is uncommon in people without &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059770/complete-list-of-foods-to-eat-when-you-have-diabetes-and-what-to-limit/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, but it can be quite common—and potentially dangerous—for those who do [have diabetes],” says &lt;a href="http://www.samanthacassetty.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Samantha Cassetty, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. However, some people without diabetes may be genetically prone to a form of low blood sugar known as reactive hypoglycemia, especially if they have a family history of diabetes or obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Low blood sugar can also be caused by certain medications, eating disorders, some types of tumors and weight-loss surgery.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When your body doesn’t get the glucose it needs from food, it can’t supply your brain with the energy it needs to function properly. This creates myriad symptoms, often leaving you feeling dizzy, lightheaded or having trouble concentrating, says Cassetty.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “This is one of the more common red flags that your blood sugar is dipping too low. It’s your body’s way of saying, hey, I’m running out of energy!” she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-youre-suddenly-shaky-anxious-or-irritable"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. You’re Suddenly Shaky, Anxious or Irritable &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Your mental functioning is directly impacted by the amount of fuel your brain has to process and respond to emotions and situations clearly,” says Cassetty. When your brain doesn’t receive the glucose it needs, it releases the hormone adrenaline to tell the body that something isn’t right.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Blood-sugar swings can affect your mood and even mimic anxiety symptoms,” she says. If you’re noticing your mood is swinging back and forth like a pendulum, it could be your blood sugar talking. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-your-heart-starts-racing"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Your Heart Starts Racing  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That adrenaline also stimulates your body’s flight-or-fight response to bring blood sugar back up to normal levels. This may lead to a rapid heartbeat and an increase in blood pressure. “For those with a chronic condition, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-lower-blood-pressure-8611460" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, as well, they should be especially cautious of this side effect,” says &lt;a href="http://blog.memeinge.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Meme Inge, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

You Feel Nauseated for No Apparent Reason &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It may seem ironic that nausea may be a side effect of low blood sugar. However, research has found that nausea can be a mild yet disruptive side effect of hypoglycemia. To complicate matters, this unpleasant side effect may seemingly come out of nowhere, says Inge. Not everyone experiences it, though. According to an older study, hypoglycemia-related nausea is more likely to occur in people on diabetes medication.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, those with diabetes are also more prone to a condition called gastroparesis, which results in delayed stomach emptying, potentially leading to nausea.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-youre-inexplicably-hungry"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. You’re Inexplicably Hungry &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This may seem like a no-brainer. But when your body doesn’t get the fuel it needs, you’re going to experience hunger as a result. Here’s why. When your body doesn’t have enough fuel on board, it releases the hunger hormone ghrelin. This tells your body you need to eat while your brain shouts, “I need sugar, now!”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You may also notice an increased desire for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-eating-too-much-sugar-11721349" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sweet foods&lt;/a&gt;, says Inge. “This is your brain’s way of telling your body you need glucose immediately. After all, your brain is counting on that sugar to fuel its many processes!” she says.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are science-backed strategies Cassetty and Inge share with their clients for more stable blood sugar:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair carbohydrates with protein or healthy fats.&lt;/strong&gt; This dynamic duo helps slow digestion and promotes steadier blood sugar. So, think &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894318/diabetes-snacks-you-should-be-meal-prepping-not-buying/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy, balanced snacks&lt;/a&gt; like nuts and fruit or a little cheese with a handful of whole-grain crackers. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load up on fiber-rich foods. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7994446/best-high-fiber-foods-for-diabetes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Fiber&lt;/a&gt; naturally slows digestion for a smooth, steady glucose release. “Rather than cutting carbs, focus on wholesome, whole food, fiber-rich options, and pair them with proteins and fats,” says Cassetty. Beans, lentils, vegetables, berries, whole grains and seeds all help regulate blood sugar, she says. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat regularly throughout the day.&lt;/strong&gt; In most cases, hypoglycemia occurs roughly two to five hours after a meal. So, it’s extra important to eat at regular intervals and avoid &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290763/the-dangers-of-skipping-meals-when-you-have-diabetes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;meal skipping&lt;/a&gt;. “A routine with eating times can be helpful so you don’t skip meals accidentally and go too long without food,” says Inge. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enlist the 15/15 rule.&lt;/strong&gt; “If you have diabetes and experience low blood sugar, it’s important to treat it right away using &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291843/these-are-the-fastest-ways-to-stabilize-your-blood-sugar-if-you-have-diabetes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;15 grams of fast-acting carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;, like juice or glucose tablets,” says Cassetty. “Then recheck your blood sugar after 15 minutes.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know the danger signs.&lt;/strong&gt; Severe low blood sugar, which is a blood glucose level less than 54 mg/dL, is a medical emergency. If you monitor your blood glucose and see it’s headed in this direction, don’t wait to treat it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep your health care professional in the loop&lt;/strong&gt;. If you suspect you’re experiencing hypoglycemia, it’s important to touch base with your health care professional, especially if you’re living with diabetes. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, occurs when blood glucose levels fall below 70 mg/dL. Because hypoglycemia has a long list of symptoms, it’s not always easy to recognize. Some sneaky signs of low blood sugar include feeling dizzy, lightheaded, nauseous, shaky, irritable and hungry. You may also have a rapid heartbeat or have difficulty concentrating.  Hypoglycemia most commonly strikes people with type 1 diabetes. However, it can also happen to those with type 2 diabetes who take insulin, people with reactive hypoglycemia, or those with certain health conditions or who have had weight-loss surgery.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re prone to low blood sugar, eating regularly throughout the day and focusing on a balanced diet rich in fiber, complex carbohydrates, lean proteins and healthy fats may help. At the extreme, severe hypoglycemia is a medical emergency and requires prompt treatment. If you suspect you’re experiencing low blood sugar, be sure to discuss it with your health care professional, who can help you develop strategies to manage this condition.&lt;br&gt;

The lump was &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://people.com/fast-spreading-cancer-on-thumb-two-black-lines-11692199" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:melanoma;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;melanoma&lt;/a&gt;, but as the civil servant, who hails from the UK’s Greater Manchester area, said, she was told she was cancer-free once it was removed, according to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14760539/freckle-stage-four-skin-cancer-months-live.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Daily Mail;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then, in March 2024, symptoms started; Cooper began experiencing aches and pains following a trip to Disneyland Paris, but doctors dismissed them as “just a virus” she’d picked up on her trip. Five weeks later, she was bedridden “in agony” — and a return visit to the doctor delivered “terrifying” news: her melanoma had returned, and metastasized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy Katie Cooper / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Katie Cooper's melanoma spread to her spine and bones, breaking her back.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/can-you-help-a-brave-young-mum-fighting-stage4-melanoma" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; established to help Cooper pay for medical expenses explains, Cooper’s “back was broken,” as the cancer was in her spine and bones — as well as in her liver, abdominal wall, lungs, and ovaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We had no idea and we just thought I was unwell. It blindsided us,” she said, according to the outlet. “Finding out subsequently that it was in my other organs as well, I knew it would be quite difficult from here on out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooper is undergoing radiation and immunotherapy treatment, in an effort to extend her life, but as her friend, Abi Smith, said, her best prognosis of living for the next ten years is 60% — if the treatment works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Cooper's primary concern is her toddler, Aurora; As Smith said, “'She's accepted the cancer, but when she thinks about her three-year-old daughter, Aurora, she gets really upset."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She's hoping she'll be there for all her milestones,” Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy Katie Cooper / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Katie Cooper is hoping her treatment works so se can be there for her toddler's 'milestones.'&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/melanoma-skin-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; has estimated that approximately 105,000 new melanomas will be diagnosed in 2025 and about 8,400 are “expected to die of melanoma.” The organization noted that while it is more common for older adults to be diagnosed with melanoma, “it’s one of the most common &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/cancer-in-young-adults.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cancers in young adults;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cancers in young adults&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While melanoma “accounts for only about 1% of skin cancers,” it “causes a large majority of skin cancer deaths.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/mom-32-small-freckle-melanoma-cancer-spread-11746258" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 21:33:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE5tNXlMYnVSekNyQzJXWGlEOVNnSndmWHpMS05IVlRiRVYyWXJMTnFZeEh0ekxWUV80dWdqVFBmTFMwQkpmMTUtT1lKNFpMNzMwczZJcjF4SGRDdURGdW5lODBiVFlxcGVTTnRkMQ</guid></item><item><title>新的研究表明，这种简单的生活方式改变可以帮助您将心脏病发作的风险降低61 ％ - EatingWell | This Simple Lifestyle Change Could Help Lower Your Heart Attack Risk by Up to 61%, New Study Says - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE9ySDFabm1sVHFWXzhVQmtNVjVNZHZOaUNUM3VBMXVmUXdNZUxmMk9FOGtTdE50b1pEWVA0WjY3eUpSQ3F1NWZ6aVRlbERyTjJYNl9pNlp0MS1PdVAzZjVVcjl4VTlQOVdObmsyWXZnbWw1eVI1YUEzNA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study focuses on former emergency room (ER) patients with symptoms like chest pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After leaving the ER, sedentary behavior was linked with a higher risk of cardiac events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But replacing sedentary behavior with sleep or exercise reduced the risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Mounting research supports the notion that the more sedentary time you rack up, the higher your risk of disease, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-break-to-reduce-dementia-risk-11682107" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;including dementia&lt;/a&gt;. Too much sitting may even &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8074778/habit-to-break-for-a-longer-life/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;shorten your lifespan&lt;/a&gt;. Sedentary behavior has also been linked to a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/this-common-habit-can-increase-your-risk-of-heart-failure-11693146" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;higher risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, the number one cause of death in the U.S.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Each year, more than 11 million people visit emergency rooms across the country with chest pain, and around 65% of them are admitted to the hospital. That makes up a quarter of all hospital admissions from the ER.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But even though heart disease is the top cause of death in America, it’s also highly preventable. Diet, physical activity, stress and sleep all play important roles in heart health—whether you’ve been diagnosed with heart disease or not.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers from Columbia University took a closer look at sedentary behavior following an ER or hospital admission for chest pain and other symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including shortness of breath, sweating and dizziness. They wanted to know if there was a connection between the amount of sedentary behavior and the risk of having a cardiac event, like a heart attack, or death from a cardiac event during the year following the hospital visit. They recently published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break them down. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this study, researchers recruited patients who visited the ER at Columbia University Medical Center with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome between September 2016 and March 2020. They accepted a total of 609 participants who met their criteria. Participants’ average age was 62, and just over half were male. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants each received a wrist accelerometer to wear, which records time and intensity of movement, sleep and sedentary behavior. Accelerometers were provided to patients while in the hospital. They were instructed to wear it on their non-dominant wrist continuously for 24 hours while in the hospital and for at least 30 days post-discharge.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides accelerometer data, researchers also gathered data on age, sex, race/ethnicity, education and whether or not they had a partner, health insurance and an actual diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, researchers were looking for participants who had a cardiac event or died of any cause during the 12 months following entry into the study. Researchers received this information from electronic medical records and by calling participants at the end of the study period. Cardiac events included a heart attack, urgent coronary revascularization (like cardiac bypass surgery) or hospitalization for unstable angina (chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-show"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Show? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Several findings surfaced following statistical analysis. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Replacing 30 minutes of sedentary time with low-intensity physical activity was associated with a 51% lower risk of cardiac events and dying from anything.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replacing 30 minutes of sedentary time with moderate-vigorous physical activity was associated with a 61% lower risk of cardiac events and dying from anything.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replacing 30 minutes of sedentary time with 30 minutes of sleep was associated with a 14% lower risk of cardiac events and dying from anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, these results suggest that swapping sitting with just about anything else, including sleep, may reduce the risk of cardiac events and death.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; An important note that researchers highlight is that there is evidence suggesting that patients who are hospitalized with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome, but who ultimately have acute coronary syndrome ruled out, are still at increased risk of adverse outcomes, including cardiovascular events. In other words, if you are hospitalized for signs of a heart attack but they rule it out, you are likely still at high risk for having one. So if you have symptoms but are not formally diagnosed, you should still take those symptoms seriously.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are a few limitations to this study. First, participants wore accelerometers during the first 30 days following discharge. Some patients might have been less active during this time, as people are often cautious about movement following cardiac events. Also, while certain demographics were adjusted for, it’s impossible to catch all factors that can skew results. Lastly, the results lose some statistical power due to the small number of events (cardiac or death) that took place during the 12 months. Therefore, the researchers state that these results should be interpreted with caution and considered preliminary evidence. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These results show that it doesn’t take a huge shift to potentially see big changes—in this case, a reduction in cardiac events and death. While moderate-vigorous physical activity showed the greatest risk reduction, low-intensity physical activity had some pretty amazing results, too. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it might come as no surprise that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-may-reduce-heart-disease-by-lowering-stress-response-8635621" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;physical activity reduces heart disease risk&lt;/a&gt;, you might be wondering why sleep would. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Unlike sitting, sleep promotes healthful, restorative processes that help regulate blood pressure, reduce inflammation and support heart function,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.columbiacardiology.org/profile/keith-diaz-phd" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Keith Diaz, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, one of the study’s lead authors and associate professor of behavioral medicine at Columbia University. “Sitting for hours at a time does the opposite. It increases blood pressure, can trigger chronic inflammation and contributes to poor heart health. For example, blood pressure typically drops by more than 10% during sleep. This gives your heart, blood vessels and other organs a reprieve from higher pressures that can be damaging to them.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Current physical activity guidelines recommend getting at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity a week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Strength training is also recommended at least twice a week. Plus you want to try to fit in some stretching throughout your week. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that any amount of physical activity is better than none—and it doesn’t have to be done every day. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-every-day-study-11707905" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;We previously reported&lt;/a&gt; on a study that found that “weekend warriors” get just about as many health benefits as those who exercise over several days.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But physical activity and sleep are just a part of the heart disease puzzle. The American Heart Association promotes its Life’s Essential 8 wheel for heart disease prevention and overall good health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The wheel consists of four health behaviors and four health factors. The health behaviors include eating healthy, moving your body, quitting tobacco and getting healthy sleep.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that by replacing 30 minutes of sedentary time with exercise of any kind or with sleep, you may reduce your risk of having a cardiac event or dying following a visit to the hospital for chest pain. If you’re currently inactive, start looking for ways to be intentional with your activity. Take the stairs, park at the far end of the parking lot and take movement breaks throughout the day. If you’ve got sleep issues, assess your bedtime routine and sleep environment and make appropriate changes. If you snore or are getting the proper amount of sleep but are still exhausted, consult with your healthcare practitioner, who can assess your situation and refer you to the appropriate specialists.&lt;br&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Texas health department said that the person likely got infected when they rinsed their sinuses with tap water from an RV's water system at a campground&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Texas is among the states that have suffered the largest burden of brain-eating amoeba cases, with 39 of around 160 recorded in the US all-time in the Lone Star state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The amoeba causes a disease called primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, also known as PAM or amebic meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It thrives in warm water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initial symptoms include a headache, vomiting and nausea. A person can then suffer cognitive issues and a stuff neck as things progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It causes severe swelling, and eventually rotting, of the brain and spinal cord. This will almost always eventually lead to death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are no known effective treatments for PAM. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the recent Texas case, the woman developed severe neurologic symptoms, including fever, headache, and altered mental status within four days of using a nasal irrigation device filled with the compromised tap water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite medical treatment, the patient developed seizures and subsequently died eight days after symptom onset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Laboratory testing at CDC confirmed the presence of N. fowleri in the patient's brain and spinal fluid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sinus rinsing is a practice where a person flows water into their nose through one nostril and out the other - in an attempt to clean mucus and other debris. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Local officials advise residents to boil water for at least one minute before using it to wash their noses to kill any lingering bacteria or harmful chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also say not to allow water into your nose when showering, bathing, swimming, or in a blow-up pool, not to put your head underwater in the tub, to avoid letting children play with sprinklers while unsupervised and the avoid slip-and-slides. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is not the first recent case potentially tied to water systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; In 2020, a six-year-old boy in Lake Jackson, Texas &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-9894927/Seven-year-old-boy-dies-contracting-rare-brain-eating-parasite-California-lake.html"&gt;died from Naegleria fowleri.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials believe he was either infected while playing in a local splash pad or from a water hose at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in 2023, a man in Charlotte County, Florida, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-11808615/Florida-man-dies-brain-eating-infection-rinsing-nose-TAP-WATER.html"&gt;died after nasal rinsing with tap water.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The amoeba, which is 1,200 times smaller than a dime, enters the body through the olfactory nerve which connects the upper nose to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This gives it a short and direct route into the brain. If water containing the amoeba enters the nose, it will likely lead to infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ingesting water through the mouth is ok because stomach acid is strong enough to kill the amoeba. The nose is its only route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once a person's olfactory nerve is exposed, it can take around one to nine days to start experiencing symptoms. They will usually die within five days of symptoms first appearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's quite rapid, it's very progressive. It literally eats the brain tissue,' Dr. Anjan Debnath, a parasitologist at the University of California San Diego, explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of the rare infection, doctors also often misdiagnose symptoms as meningitis - wasting valuable time that could be used to treat the parasite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Caleb Ziegelbauer (pictured), 13, may become the fifth ever American to survive an infection from brain eating amoeba&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He describes the infection as taking part in two stages. The first is relatively minor, with the person experiencing a headache and other flu-like symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means that unless a doctor knows that a person has been swimming in untreated water they may not even suspect the amoeba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once symptoms reach the second stage, a person will start experiencing severe neurological issues like seizures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A doctor will then likely find out about the infection through a spinal fluid test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;America suffers around three cases of the amoeba each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They will almost always occur over summer, when many families flock to local lakes and ponds for a daytime outing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Debnath still advises against swimming in untreated water over summer, especially in places like Florida and Texas where temperatures get exceptionally high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because the amoeba only resides in fresh water, swimming in the ocean is generally safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If families do choose to visit a freshwater beach, anyone entering the water should wear a nose clip to prevent water from entering their nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Debnath also recommends against kicking up dirt or sand from the bottom of the lake as warmer areas deep down are where the microscopic beings usually lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 20:44:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>阻断脑炎症分子可能阻止阿尔茨海默氏症-神经科学新闻 | Blocking Brain Inflammation Molecule May Halt Alzheimer’s - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTFAzeWpOLUdRb2VUX2ZsVDZfTW1qRGhIZm5yc3VlOUFhM3FnVWY2RDBNSVVPNUM2WnRFZnhrVDluVDJhWWJLSkVxZ3ZfdnZQaGl0bXkyZFMzU1RvekRTOTM1NDVod2t2UWhZYUVmd0Zfa3p2SGFf?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study has uncovered a surprising culprit in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease: the immune molecule STING. Scientists found that STING, normally involved in defending the brain, becomes hyperactive with age, causing harmful inflammation and accelerating brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mouse models, blocking STING prevented the buildup of plaques and tangles and protected cognitive function. This breakthrough points to STING as a promising therapeutic target not just for Alzheimer’s, but also for other neurodegenerative diseases like ALS and Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STING Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; DNA damage during aging triggers STING, leading to harmful brain inflammation and neuronal injury.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Target:&lt;/strong&gt; Blocking STING in mice reduced plaque formation, protected neurons, and improved memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; STING may also play roles in Parkinson’s, ALS, and dementia, offering a new treatment pathway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Virginia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new way of thinking about Alzheimer’s disease has yielded a discovery that could be the key to stopping the cognitive decline seen in Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Virginia School of Medicine scientists have been investigating the possibility that Alzheimer’s is caused, at least in part, by the immune system’s wayward attempts to fix DNA damage in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110580"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The causes of Alzheimer’s remain murky, but scientists are increasingly coming to appreciate the role of the immune system in the disease’s development. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their research reveals that an immune molecule called STING drives the formation of the harmful plaques and protein tangles thought responsible for Alzheimer’s. Blocking the molecule protected lab mice from mental decline, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An important player in the brain’s immune system, STING also may be a key contributor to Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease), dementia and other memory-robbing conditions. That means that developing treatments to control its activity could have far-reaching benefits for many patients facing now-devastating diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings demonstrate that the DNA damage that naturally accumulates during aging triggers STING-mediated brain inflammation and neuronal damage in Alzheimer’s disease,” said researcher John Lukens, PhD, director of UVA’s Harrison Family Translational Research Center in Alzheimer’s and Neurodegenerative Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results help to explain why aging is associated with increased Alzheimer’s risk and uncover a novel pathway to target in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alarming Trends in Alzheimer’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s is a growing problem across the country and around the world: More than 7 million Americans are already living with the condition, and that number could top 13 million by 2050. That has researchers working frantically to find ways to better understand and treat the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The causes of Alzheimer’s remain murky, but scientists are increasingly coming to appreciate the role of the immune system in the disease’s development. STING is part of that immune response; the molecule helps direct the clearance of viruses and stressed cells harboring DNA damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While STING is an important defender of the brain, it can also become hyperactive and cause harmful inflammation and tissue damage. That had Lukens and his team eager to determine what part it could be playing in Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking the molecule’s activity in lab mice, they found, helped prevent Alzheimer’s plaque formation, altered the activity of immune cells called microglia and redirected the workings of important genes, among other effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that removing STING dampened microglial activation around amyloid plaques, protected nearby neurons from damage and improved memory function in Alzheimer’s model mice,” said researcher Jessica Thanos, part of UVA’s Department of Neuroscience and Center for Brain Immunology and Glia (BIG Center).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Together, these findings suggest that STING drives detrimental immune responses in the brain that exacerbate neuronal damage and contribute to cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising Treatment Target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scientists have been investigating other molecules thought to be important in Alzheimer’s, STING makes for a particularly attractive target for developing new treatments, the UVA Health researchers say. That’s because blocking STING appears to slow both the buildup of amyloid plaques and the development of tau tangles, the two leading candidates for the cause of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other molecules lack that robust involvement, and, further, could be targeted only at very specific – and very limited – stages in the disease’s progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are only beginning to understand the complex role of innate immune activation in the brain, and this is especially true in both normal and pathological aging,” Thanos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can pinpoint which cells and signals sustain that activation, we will be in a much better position to intervene effectively in disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Lukens’ pioneering research has opened new doors in the fight against Alzheimer’s, much more work will need to be done to translate the findings into treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, scientists will need to better understand STING’s roles in the body – such as in the immune system’s response to cancer – to ensure any new treatment doesn’t cause unwanted side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But those are the types of big questions that Lukens and his collaborators at the Harrison Family Translational Research Center are eager to tackle as part of their efforts to fast-track new treatments and, eventually, they hope, cures. (The center is part of UVA’s Paul and Diane Manning Institute of Biotechnology, now under construction at Fontaine Research Park.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our hope is that this work moves us close to finding safer and more effective ways to protect the aging brain, as there is an urgent need for treatments that can slow or prevent neuronal damage in Alzheimer’s,” Lukens said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Shedding light on how STING contributes to that damage may help us target similar molecules and ultimately develop effective disease-modifying treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings Published&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team consisted of Thanos, Olivia C.

But the less-discussed part on “overmedicalization” of American children stood out to us. While the report mentions surgical care only briefly, it identifies two common procedures, adenotonsillectomy and tympanostomy tube (ear tube) placement, as surgeries that “cause harm without offering benefits.” These procedures are among the most performed surgeries in children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are pediatric ear, nose, and throat surgeons with years of clinical and research experience. One of us (EB) leads research on how parents make decisions about elective surgeries like tonsillectomy. The other (DT) has led development of national evidence-based clinical practice guidelines aimed to ensure appropriate surgical care. We agree that these two childhood procedures are performed often enough to warrant vigilance around overuse and unnecessary surgery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the MAHA report presents its conclusions on surgery with tunnel vision and misinterpretation. It did not recognize proven benefits of surgery: for tonsil and adenoid removal, improved sleep, behavior, and learning; for ear tube placement, better hearing, speech, and fewer infections. In appropriately selected children, these surgeries improve quality of life and reduce both health care visits and use of antibiotics. A blanket dismissal of surgical benefits could threaten access to necessary care for children with sleep apnea or hearing loss. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The appropriate indications and expected health benefits of adenotonsillectomy and ear tube surgery for young children have been debated for decades. In 2009, President Obama &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/22/us/politics/22obama.transcript.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that financial factors might influence a surgeon’s decision to recommend tonsillectomy. In 2012, a National Summit on Overuse highlighted &lt;a href="https://www.parsemus.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/AMA-National_Summit_Overuse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;misuse of ear tubes for short-term ear fluid&lt;/a&gt;. Events like these spurred the development of evidence-based practice guidelines informed by clinical trials, experience, and patient outcomes. These guidelines &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30798778/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;clearly delineate surgical indications&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://aao-hnsfjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1177/01945998211065662" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;emphasize shared decision-making&lt;/a&gt; between families and surgeons. Though still common, these surgeries have decreased in frequency over time. Meanwhile, indications have evolved and become more precise. Tonsillectomy, once used for recurrent throat infections, is now most often performed to treat obstructed breathing and sleep apnea. Ear tubes are now used to treat persistent middle ear fluid causing hearing loss and speech delay rather than infrequent, uncomplicated ear infections.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;There are real, proven, and often life-changing benefits of adenotonsillectomy and ear tube surgery for many children. Performed on &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28256998/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;nearly 300,000 U.S. children each year&lt;/a&gt;, adenotonsillectomy is used to treat children with obstructive sleep apnea, a common condition that can lead to heart and lung strain, fatigue, hyperactivity, inattention, bedwetting, and learning delays.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MAHA report states there is no benefit of adenotonsillectomy for sleep apnea, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31919049/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;citing a single study&lt;/a&gt; that found no difference in a generic IQ screening measure. However, that same study also reported significant improvements in sleep apnea severity, behavior, and physical health in children who underwent surgery — findings that were not acknowledged in the MAHA report. More concerning, the report failed to reference many additional well-designed studies that show consistent improvements in health, sleep, behavior, learning, and quality of life after surgery. Large-scale randomized &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23692173/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; confirm that while some children with sleep apnea may improve without treatment, the majority continue to experience symptoms that are alleviated with surgery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ear tube surgery tells a similar story. Yes, overuse has occurred, especially for children with recurrent infections or transient middle ear fluid. Contemporary guidelines advise against surgery in such cases. But for children with persistent fluid and hearing loss, ear tubes provide measurable improvement. Judicious use of ear tubes also helps reduce repeated antibiotic use, a key overtreatment concern highlighted in the MAHA report. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How can we move forward, guarding against overuse while continuing to offer surgery to children who will benefit? We must better understand the real-world complexity of children undergoing surgery. Research should expand to include data beyond clinical trials and fragmented outcome measure assessment. We must also promote best practices that reduce risk and recognize that two children with the same diagnosis may have different symptom burdens, family priorities, and definitions of successful treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surgery for children should always be under scrutiny. We strive to offer surgery only when expected outcomes are favorable, risks are minimal, and disease burden justifies intervention. We applaud MAHA policymakers who focus on overuse, but we urge a comprehensive review of trials, systematic reviews, and practice guidelines. Tonsillectomy and ear tube surgery benefit many children. We know this not only from a more thorough analysis than MAHA provided, but also from clinical experience treating thousands of children. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If evidence and our experience are not enough, ask the parents. They will tell you about children who sleep soundly, hear clearly, speak precisely, perform better in school, and were changed for the better by surgery that was carefully considered and prudently delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

Typically, flies avoid the drug due to its bitter taste, but by disabling their bitter-sensing receptors, scientists encouraged addictive behavior within just 16 hours of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model is a major step toward rapidly testing the genetic and neurological mechanisms behind cocaine use disorder. Because flies share many addiction-related genes with humans, this research could greatly accelerate the discovery of effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fly Addiction Model:&lt;/strong&gt; Genetically altered fruit flies will now self-administer cocaine, mimicking addictive behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taste Receptor Blockade:&lt;/strong&gt; Disabling bitter taste receptors enabled flies to prefer cocaine-laced sugar water.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Acceleration:&lt;/strong&gt; This model allows fast screening of addiction-related genes to inform treatment targets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Utah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the first time, researchers have created genetically modified fruit flies that can become addicted to cocaine. The flies will self-administer cocaine if given the option. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new model could prove immensely valuable for the development of new therapies to prevent and treat cocaine use disorder, a growing and deadly concern that affects about 1.5 million people nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110576"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The dosage was important—flies would only voluntarily consume cocaine at low concentrations—but they developed a preference remarkably quickly, within 16 hours of first exposure. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heredity strongly impacts the risk of developing cocaine use disorder, but the large number of genes implicated in addiction risk has made it difficult to determine which might be the best targets for therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With their new fruit fly model of cocaine use disorder, the researchers hope to reveal the biology of addiction and find better therapies much faster than was previously possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new results are published in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-flying aspirations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flies and humans react to cocaine in remarkably similar ways, says Adrian Rothenfluh, PhD, associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Utah and the senior author on the study. “At low doses, they start running around, just like people,” Rothenfluh says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At very high doses, they get incapacitated, which is also true in people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flies and humans have a lot in common when it comes to addiction. Flies have about 75% of the human genes that are known to be involved in disease, and the insects have been instrumental in discovering the underlying biology behind other substance dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because fruit flies grow quickly and are easy to conduct genetic experiments with, a fruit fly model of cocaine use disorder would be a valuable early step toward developing therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is just one problem—one very significant difference between flies and humans—Rothenfluh says: “Flies do not like cocaine one bit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His research team found that when given a choice between sugar water and sugar water laced with cocaine, fruit flies consistently chose the drug-free option, even when they’d been exposed to cocaine previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand addiction in humans, the scientists needed to figure out why flies wouldn’t take cocaine—and if there was a way to bypass that barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bitter truth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travis Philyaw, PhD, first author on the paper, suspected that the answer might lie in the flies’ sense of taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Insects are evolutionarily primed to avoid plant toxins, and cocaine is a plant toxin,” says Philyaw, now a research scientist at University of Washington, who did the research as a graduate student in Rothenfluh’s lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They have taste receptors on their ‘arms’—their tarsal segments—so they can put their hand in something before it goes in their mouth, and decide, ‘I’m not going to touch that.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By watching how flies’ sensory nerves responded to cocaine, the researchers found that the compound strongly activates bitter-sensing taste receptors in the flies’ tarsal segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers muted the activity of those bitter-sensing nerves so that the flies couldn’t taste bitter flavors, they did start developing a preference for cocaine-laced sugar water over plain sugar water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dosage was important—flies would only voluntarily consume cocaine at low concentrations—but they developed a preference remarkably quickly, within 16 hours of first exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From insects to impacts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say this will help them understand addiction in humans. Now that scientists can study the process in fruit flies, the pipeline to new discoveries can be greatly accelerated, studying hundreds of potentially relevant genes in a much shorter time span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can scale research so quickly in flies,” Philyaw says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can identify risk genes that might be difficult to uncover in more complex organisms, and then we pass that information to researchers who work with mammalian models. Then, they’re able to uncover treatment targets that facilitate the jump from studying animal behavior to developing human therapeutics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rothenfluh agrees: “We can really start to understand the mechanisms of cocaine choice, and the more you understand about the mechanism, the more you have a chance to find a therapeutic that might act on that mechanism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to specific searches for therapeutics, Rothenfluh says basic research into the mechanisms of how the human mind—and the fruit fly mind—work can have unexpected impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just trying to understand the simple little fly brain can give us insights that you cannot anticipate,” he emphasizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Basic science is important, and you never know what exciting things you might find that turn out to be impactful for understanding the human condition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is published in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience &lt;/em&gt;as “Bitter sensing protects Drosophila from developing experience-dependent cocaine consumption preference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The work was funded by the Huntsman Mental Health Institute, the University of Utah Molecular Medicine Program, and the National Institutes of Health, including the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (grant number R01DK110358), the National Institute on Drug Abuse (grants K01DA058919, R21DA049635, and R21DA040439), and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (grants R01AA026818, R01AA019536-S1, and R01AA030881).

Little is known about the specific genes and mechanisms that lead to the development of CUD, and there are currently no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies that can treat it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; has proven an effective model organism to identify genes and mechanisms underlying addiction, especially alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While flies exposed to cocaine display features of acute intoxication like those observed in mammals, including hyperactivity and reduced sleep, to date, there is no model of preferential cocaine self-administration in flies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we assayed cocaine consumption in &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; males, as well as preference in a two-choice paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also investigated mechanisms involved in cocaine taste sensing using genetic and imaging tools. We show that cocaine is innately aversive to flies and that this avoidance depends on bitter sensing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gustatory sensory neurons expressing the Gr66a bitter receptor are activated upon exposure to cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silencing of these bitter-sensing neurons or mutation of &lt;em&gt;Gr66a&lt;/em&gt; reduces cocaine avoidance. In a longitudinal choice assay, these flies develop preference for cocaine-containing solutions within 12-18 h, whereas control flies do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings show that bitter sensation protects flies from developing cocaine self-administration preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, silencing bitter perception enables us to use &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; as a model for experience-dependent cocaine self-administration preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This opens the door to testing human variants associated with CUD for their causative role in cocaine self-administration in this highly tractable model organism.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 20:07:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE5zcG9MNlZ1MEdkbTdOc3hGcFNaYXhOMDhtUVE3TjRxSHdTM1kyaW1reG95TlJpSjdBRkF2RjdTTjM0eERDbS1MRW9FNktVYmNZTHB2UHBXLW95aTZyckZsWjJROFpXVC00NGFjMjVEYw</guid></item><item><title>“随行效应” —我们不知道大麻是如何工作的- PsyPost | The ‘entourage effect’ — what we don’t know about how cannabis works - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxQX0V6elVGX1RNMGZWMG9BNWpxc2RBYklHeFEzRUppRGFOaTRpenpGUGpNSkUyVXk1aWtsZXk0Vk9UQ204SFFmY0M2NjNzUFdMVnFJV2pHTWtZZUV1UldYQ0R6ZVZ0ajdlSy1YUWFiWGpBdVBNZkVGcERrLXlsbGs3RmJYZm1vZ0lPcHBuaG5wQkxlZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the years since legalization, there has been a tremendous surge in the &lt;a href="https://www.doingbusinesswithocs.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/OCS-By-the-Numbers-Data-Report-2023.pdf"&gt;number of cannabis products&lt;/a&gt; available to Canadian consumers, many offering tailored experiences to enhance seemingly any mood or activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you want something calming or uplifting? Are you looking to inspire focus, spark creativity or get a good night’s sleep? Do you prefer full-spectrum extracts or THC isolates?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how does one plant produce so many different experiences? Like many of its botanical relatives, cannabis is rich in active compounds. The prevailing view is that these compounds work together to shape the overall experience, a phenomenon known as the “entourage effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a consumer standpoint, the idea of custom-tailored experiences guided by key active ingredients is appealing — and it certainly makes things easier. But in reality, it’s not so cut-and-dried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making informed decisions as a cannabis consumer can seem overwhelming, and navigating a product menu can feel like it requires a chemistry degree. But how much do we really know about how cannabis works? And how well are we able to predict individual experiences based on a product’s composition?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s in a high?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most research into cannabis’ effects has focused on two key compounds, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2022.12.022"&gt;Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)&lt;/a&gt;. CBD is non-intoxicating and thought to underlie many therapeutic effects of cannabis, whereas THC is the primary compound responsible for the classic cannabis high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the most pertinent information available to cannabis consumers was the THC:CBD ratio, and from a regulatory standpoint, these are the only compounds required by &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-medication/cannabis/laws-regulations/regulations-support-cannabis-act.html"&gt;Health Canada&lt;/a&gt; for product labels. But the cannabis plant produces over &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26092774"&gt;500 potentially bioactive compounds&lt;/a&gt;, most notably cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids, with increasing emphasis being placed on how they interact to drive different experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that the different components of cannabis work in concert, modulating one another’s activity to influence the overall experience, has been termed the “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01238.x"&gt;entourage effect&lt;/a&gt;.” Simply put, it seeks to explain the effects of cannabis beyond those of any individual component, such as THC or CBD, and offers an elegant explanation for a common question: how can products with the same amount of THC and CBD produce different effects?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the medical cannabis community has long-favoured full- and broad-spectrum products (those containing a varied chemical profile) over single-compound isolates such as purified THC or CBD, based on claims of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/can.2021.0114"&gt;superior safety and efficacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask your local budtender for a recommendation and you will likely get a crash-course on terpene nomenclature, hearing words like limonene, myrcene, pinene and linalool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this modern embrace of terpene pharmacology and natural product chemistry reflects a growing appreciation for the complexities of the cannabis plant, claims of entourage effects remain largely speculative, highlighting how much we’ve yet to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sound science or smoke and mirrors?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0014-2999(98)00392-6"&gt;Initially coined by scientists in Israel and Italy&lt;/a&gt; in study published in 1998, the term “entourage effect” described interactions among endogenous cannabinoids (THC-and CBD-like molecules produced by the human body). The idea was that some of these compounds, which are inactive on their own, could enhance or modulate the activity of others, resulting in combined effects greater than the sum of their parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that this study did not examine plant-derived cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant, but rather structurally related compounds produced naturally in the brain and body. As such, the idea of cannabis-specific entourage effects did not emerge directly from the data itself, but from broader inferences drawn from that research that provided a rationale for the diverse effects often reported by cannabis users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, and despite a lack of supporting evidence, the term has been widely adopted and adapted by the cannabis industry, often leveraged to differentiate products in an overly crowded market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The available support for entourage effects in humans is limited to a few small clinical and observational studies and meta-analyses that suggest whole-plant extracts may outperform isolates for conditions like &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.091414"&gt;chronic pain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1055/a-2002-2119"&gt;pediatric epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these studies often use non-standardized extracts and are therefore unable to identify which chemical interactions are driving the effects. Further, direct comparisons of full-spectrum and isolate products are lacking, with most claims rooted in inferences made from pre-clinical (in other words, non-human) research and from studies of non-cannabis derived phytomolecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, the entourage effect is a valid hypothesis and arguably the most promising in terms of explaining cannabis’s varied and nuanced effects. Similar effects have been described for other drug classes, though these interactions are often termed &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.1549"&gt;synergism and potentiation&lt;/a&gt; and typically involve just a few well-characterized compounds. In contrast, unlocking cannabis synergy requires untangling the interactions of hundreds of different molecules, many of which are still poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That complexity is what I’ve spent my career trying to understand. Researching how cannabis-derived compounds work in the brain and body, I have gained a considerable appreciation for how far our understanding of cannabis has come, how much we have still yet to uncover and how easy it is for enthusiasm to outpace evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reading between the product lines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the cannabis industry continues to evolve, consumers need to approach product claims with a healthy dose of skepticism. There is no doubt the cannabis plant is a treasure trove of unexplored and underexplored bioactive molecules, and that we will continue to uncover interesting and unexpected interactions among them. But we are far from a complete picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, the entourage effect remains a hypothesis more often co-opted for marketing than grounded in evidence. That doesn’t mean it’s wrong, but it does mean we should resist conflating convenient narratives with established science. This highlights an important question: where does the onus of responsibility for generating this new knowledge fall?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the cannabis industry continues invoking the entourage effect for marketing and product differentiation, then it should support and contribute to research that furthers the state of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relying solely on existing pre-clinical and academic studies in lieu of directly advancing the science and validating real-world product claims risks perpetuating hype at the expense of credibility. But industry is not alone in their duty. Government must also remedy the regulatory bottlenecks that impede new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Establishing a credible, science-backed cannabis marketplace means moving beyond hype. It requires action, from industry and government, to generate the information consumers need to make informed decisions.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/251799/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/251799/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

You attach one end of the band to the barbell and the other end to an anchor near the floor. At the bottom of the lift, the bands are slack, but as you raise the barbell, the band stretches and increases tension, making the barbell feel heavier as you get to the top of the lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-11"&gt;Back in my powerlifting days, &lt;a href="https://store.barbell-logic.com/art-of-manliness/"&gt;my barbell coach, Matt Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;, incorporated chains and banded lifts into my programming quite a bit. I really enjoyed them because they added variety to my training and helped me get past some sticking points in my lifts that had plagued me for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-12"&gt;To help walk us through the benefits of accommodating resistance and how to incorporate it into your programming, I hopped on the horn with Matt to get his insights and advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h.uypmck97ap7" class="ai-optimize-13"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Brief History of Accommodating Resistance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-14"&gt;The idea of varying resistance through a lift’s range of motion has been around since the early days of strength training. Early 20th-century strongmen would use chains in their exercises to vary the load during the lift. In the mid-20th century, Soviet powerlifting legend &lt;a href="https://www.oldtimestrongman.com/blog/2014/03/25/alexeevs-unusual-training/"&gt;Vasily Alekseyev&lt;/a&gt; would do his lifts in waist-high water to add some accommodating resistance to his exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-15"&gt;It wasn’t until the 1990s that accommodating resistance became a popular tool among powerlifters. And the man who had the biggest impact in spreading its use was Louie Simmons of &lt;a href="https://www.westside-barbell.com/"&gt;Westside Barbell.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-16"&gt;Simmons began attaching heavy chains to barbells to accommodate the body’s changing leverage throughout the lift. He later started using elastic bands with his lifters as an alternative way to provide accommodating resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h.tfq0jede822x" class="ai-optimize-17"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Use Accommodating Resistance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-18"&gt;Here’s what accommodating resistance offers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-19"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matches Your Strength Curve. &lt;/strong&gt;The biggest reason you would use accommodating resistance is that it makes the lift match your strength curve: you’re stronger at the top of lifts like the squat and bench press than you are at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-20"&gt;As you lift a barbell outfitted with accommodating resistance, the chains gradually rise off the floor or the bands stretch, increasing the load as the barbell goes higher and higher and getting the heaviest at the top of the movement. Thus, the lift is lighter at the bottom, where you’re weakest, and heavier at the top, where you’re strongest. “By increasing the resistance as you move into the stronger parts of your lift, you recruit more muscle fibers, which helps with strength and hypertrophy,” Matt told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="htlad-Mobile_Inline_MedRec"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-21"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increases Power and Bar Speed.&lt;/strong&gt; “Accommodating resistance forces compensatory acceleration,” Matt says. “You’re kind of in a race to the top. The bar gets heavier as you lift it, so it teaches you to push harder all the way through.” This develops explosive strength by requiring a high rate of continuous force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-22"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overcomes Sticking Points. &lt;/strong&gt;At some point in your training career, you’ll discover you have sticking points — places in the lift where you can’t seem to go any further. For example, I had a period where I was having trouble locking out my bench press. I started adding chains to the lift and because the barbell got heavier as it moved up, I was able to really train getting through lockout. Once I took the chains off, the barbell just felt super light throughout the lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-23"&gt;As Matt explains, because accommodating resistance overloads the parts of a lift where you’re strong and keeps the weight light where you’re weak, you get “more velocity going into the sticking point; you often get higher up and in a better leverage position before the sticking point really catches up with you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-24"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenges your muscles in a different way. &lt;/strong&gt;Accommodating resistance, especially in the form of bands, forces you to stabilize the bar. It also improves bar control and requires you to stay tight throughout the lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h.k03tp0cnbes7" class="ai-optimize-25"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chains vs. Bands: Pros, Cons, and Best Uses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-26"&gt;There are two ways to add accommodating resistance: chains and elastic bands. Each one has its pros and cons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-27"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chains.&lt;/strong&gt; Chains provide a resistance curve that deloads and loads in a more linear way compared to bands. As Matt explained, “They don’t actively pull down on the bar; standard gravity applies.” That makes them easier to control and more forgiving. Chains are easy to set up. Just hang some chains from the bar. (I’ll show you how below.) They’re ideal for beginners and excellent for matching the strength curve while still helping with sticking points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-28"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bands. &lt;/strong&gt;Bands offer more extreme variable resistance. “Bands actually increase the speed of gravity,” Matt said. “What I mean by that is if you let go of the bar, it would fall faster than gravity alone because the band is actively pulling the bar down.” Bands also introduce horizontal forces, so if your form is off, you’ll know. They’ll yank the bar out of alignment, making them less forgiving but more effective for exposing weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-29"&gt;They’re also more intense, which makes them better for advanced lifters seeking explosiveness. The other upside of bands is they are cheaper and quieter than chains. You can use bands at a public gym without causing a clanging metallic ruckus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-30"&gt;One of the downsides of bands, I think, is that they’re kind of a pain to set up. You need a squat rack that will allow you to use band pegs. And you have to make sure you place the bands on the barbell evenly so that everything remains nice and smooth during the lift and you’re not getting pulled in different directions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="htlad-Mobile_Inline_MedRec"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-31"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to Use Chains or Bands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-32"&gt;Start with chains if you’re new to accommodating resistance. They’re more forgiving and help you build confidence in your lockout without compromising form. Bands are better for experienced lifters who want to train explosively and work on bar control and speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-33"&gt;“When you’re really trying to get fast and explosive, bands are probably the better choice,” Matt noted. “But for hypertrophy and learning to get through sticking points, chains are awesome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="ai-optimize-34"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Program With Accommodating Resistance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-35"&gt;Here’s Matt’s guidance on programming:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="ai-optimize-36"&gt;Use accommodating resistance no more than once per lift per week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ai-optimize-37"&gt;Favor chains if longevity is the goal; bands for short bursts of explosive training.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ai-optimize-38"&gt;Use bands for 4–6 weeks before deloading and taking a break from them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ai-optimize-39"&gt;Use chains for 6–8 weeks before deloading and taking a break from them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-40"&gt;The reason there’s a differential in the length of time you can train with chains versus bands is that bands are harder on the body while chains are easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-41"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Accommodating Resistance in Your Supplemental Lifts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-42"&gt;Matt thinks one of the best ways to add accommodating resistance is to use it with your supplemental lifts. That’s how he programmed it for me when I was using it regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-43"&gt;A sample week of barbell training with accommodating resistance might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="ai-optimize-44"&gt;Upper Day 1: Main Lift — bench press; Supplemental Lift — chain shoulder press&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ai-optimize-45"&gt;Lower Day 1: Main Lift — squat; Supplemental Lift — chain deadlift&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ai-optimize-46"&gt;Upper Day 2: Main Lift — shoulder press; Supplemental Lift — chain bench press&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ai-optimize-47"&gt;Lower Day 2: Main Lift — deadlift; Supplemental Lift — chain squat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="h.dwhpgvv00tu" class="ai-optimize-48"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting Up Your Barbell for Chain and Band Work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-49"&gt;To get the full benefit of accommodating resistance, setup matters. Here’s how to do it right:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-50"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-51"&gt;I got my chains from Rogue Fitness. I got the&lt;a href="https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-chain-kits"&gt; 5/8″ chain kit,&lt;/a&gt; and it comes with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="ai-optimize-52"&gt;(2) 15LB lengths of 5/8″ chain with carabiners. I’d get two more 15LB lengths of the 5/8” chain, so you’ll have 30 pounds of total chains to work with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ai-optimize-53"&gt;(2) 4′ lengths of 1/4″ chain with carabiners. This is your leader chain that you’ll hang from your barbell. Once you’ve got that leader chain hanging from the barbell, you’ll hang the heavier 15LB chain lengths on it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-54"&gt;In addition to a chain set, get yourself some &lt;a href="https://www.elitefts.com/eliteftstm-ez-deadlift-loader-straps.html"&gt;EZ Straps&lt;/a&gt;. They make attaching chains for deadlifts a breeze. More on that in a second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-55"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure the Chains to the Bar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2025/06/image7.jpg" alt="Image7"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-56"&gt;For bench, squat, or press, you’re going to loop the small leader chain around the barbell sleeve, like so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2025/06/image6.jpg" alt="Image6"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-57"&gt;Then attach the big ol’ heavy chains to the leader chain with a carabiner. Attach the carabiner to the leader chain so that when you’re at the top of your lift, one or two chain links should still be on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2025/06/image4.jpg" alt="Image4"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-58"&gt;Should look like the above when all is said and done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2025/06/image5.jpg" alt="Image5"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-59"&gt;For the deadlift, just place your EZ Straps on the deadlift bar and thread your chains through the rings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2025/06/image3.jpg" alt="Image3"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-60"&gt;Super easy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-61"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="htlad-Mobile_Inline_MedRec"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-62"&gt;In my opinion, bands are kind of a pain in the butt to set up. If you don’t set them up evenly on both sides, your lift is going to be screwy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-63"&gt;You can also &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiDQDkOZMwU"&gt;use bands on weight machines&lt;/a&gt; if you’re a machine guy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-64"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadlift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2025/06/image2.jpg" alt="Image2"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-65"&gt;Anchor the bands to band pegs in your squat rack. You’ll need four pegs like above. If you don’t have band pegs, you can loop them around heavy dumbbells, but anchored bands are more secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-66"&gt;Start with light or medium bands. When you set up your bands, the band should have slight tension, even at the bottom of the lift. This will typically require you to double up the bands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-67"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Squat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2025/06/image1.jpg" alt="Image1"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="ai-optimize-68"&gt;You’ll also need band pegs for the squat.

Kseniya Ovchinnikova/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study suggests that food quality matters more than fat or carbs for heart health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A low carb, low fat diet could lack heart-protective nutrients and have too much of certain nutrients associated with heart disease risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A balanced diet with high quality, unprocessed foods is best for your heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to heart health, the quality of the food you eat could matter a lot more than simply cutting carbohydrates or fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that rather than focusing solely on &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/micros-vs-macros" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;macronutrient&lt;/a&gt; counts, emphasizing whole, minimally processed, and plant-based foods while limiting refined grains, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/added-sugar-natural-sugar-guide" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;added sugars&lt;/a&gt;, and animal products can significantly reduce the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/coronary-artery-disease" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;coronary heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ findings highlight a shift toward more personalized and nuanced dietary guidance for cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, low-carbohydrate (low carb) and low fat diets have dominated nutrition advice as methods to improve health, manage weight, and reduce risks of chronic diseases such as heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the scientific community has debated how much these diets truly protect the heart, especially when the quality of foods consumed within these diets varies greatly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health shed light on this important question, concluding that food quality is just as critical, if not more so, than merely restricting carbs or fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers tracked participants’ dietary habits and heart disease outcomes over 25 years. Detailed food frequency questionnaires allowed the team to assign scores based on the healthfulness of the foods consumed within low carb and low fat diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found a clear association between low carb and low fat diets that emphasize high quality foods (i.e., whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes) and a roughly 15% lower risk of developing coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, diets low in carbs or fat but high in unhealthy foods like refined grains, sugary snacks, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/why-processed-meat-is-bad/" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;processed meats&lt;/a&gt;, and animal fats carried a higher risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Healthy versions of these diets — those rich in plant-based foods and whole grains — were linked to better heart health outcomes and improved metabolic function. In contrast, low-carb and low-fat diets emphasizing unhealthy foods were associated with a higher risk of heart disease,” Lead study author Zhiyuan Wu, PhD, a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Nutrition at Harvard, explained in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1084802" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that simply cutting carbs or fats without considering the source and quality of these macronutrients can be counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To deepen their understanding, the research team also measured blood metabolites — a wide range of biological markers related to metabolism — in a subset of over 10,000 participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allowed them to observe how different diet qualities influenced metabolic regulation and &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cholesterol-test" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;lipid profiles&lt;/a&gt; in the body. The findings showed that healthy and unhealthy versions of low carb and low-fat diets distinctly affected plasma lipid species and other metabolites, which are important indicators of cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study differentiated between various types of low carb and low fat diets. For example, “animal-based” low carb diets, which tend to be higher in saturated fats and proteins from animal products, were linked to increased heart disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, “vegetable-based” or plant-focused low carb diets showed more favorable outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, unhealthy low fat diets that rely heavily on &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/why-refined-carbs-are-bad" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;refined carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt; and added sugars also increased risk, whereas healthy low fat diets emphasizing whole foods lowered it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaaboakye/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Yaa Boakye&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist, personal trainer, and nutrition consultant, said it’s helpful to think of food quality like a grading rubric for your body. Boakye wasn’t involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Imagine asking a student to write a book report without providing the grading rubric; they may complete the assignment, but without clear direction, their work might miss the mark,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boakye noted that food quality is akin to the rubric in that your body uses it to interpret what you eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is not enough to check off a box labeled ‘low carb’ or ‘low fat’ — we need to examine what is actually in the food: fiber content, added sugars, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-health-low-sodium-foods" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;sodium&lt;/a&gt;, micronutrients, and anti-inflammatory or proinflammatory compounds,” she explained, adding that carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are only broad categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A carbohydrate could be a refined white roll or a fiber-rich &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lentils" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;lentil&lt;/a&gt;; a fat could be processed &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/why-trans-fats-are-bad" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;trans fat&lt;/a&gt; or cold-pressed &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-proven-benefits-of-olive-oil" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt;,” she said. “Food quality helps us zoom in on these differences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boakye added that when individuals simply follow a low fat or low carb diet without considering these nuances, they tend to overlook important nutrients that have consequences for heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“High sodium levels, added sugars, lack of fiber, and insufficient &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/antioxidants-explained" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; are all red flags that often go unnoticed,” she said, adding that you could be meeting your macro targets but still consuming a diet conducive to &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/high-blood-pressure-hypertension" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, poor cholesterol profiles, or systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A ‘low fat’ diet lacking &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-foods-high-in-magnesium" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/potassium" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, and omega-3s could backfire, while a ‘low carb’ plan omitting prebiotic-rich plants or colorful fruits might hinder &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/healthy/3-ways-healthy-gut-impacts-heart-health" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt; and indirectly stress the cardiovascular system,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She advised following the plate model, which involves filling one-half of your plate with vegetables and fruit, one-quarter with lean proteins (including meat, fish, beans, or lower-fat cheese), and one-quarter with whole grains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Making this your plate automatically reduces the amount of carbohydrate you eat and reduces the fat that you’re eating because it removes a lot of excess fats that can enter someone’s diet through eating higher fat foods,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smart further noted that vegetables and fruit contain fiber, which helps keep you full so you’re less tempted to snack between meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also contain vital nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, which help protect your heart and blood vessels. According to Smart, whole grains also contain fiber and B vitamins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“All this fiber helps better control blood sugar,” she said. “Poorly controlled blood sugar contributes to heart disease by damaging blood vessels, so better &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/14-ways-to-lower-blood-sugar" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;blood sugar control&lt;/a&gt; reduces heart disease risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smart added that eating lean proteins like &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lean-protein-foods" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;lean meats&lt;/a&gt;, beans, and legumes helps keep your &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/saturated-fat-types" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;saturated fat &lt;/a&gt;intake low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that a diet filled with high quality foods will naturally include fewer &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-eat-less-processed-food" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;highly processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, which reduces your intake of sodium, saturated fat, and excess calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reducing the amount of highly processed foods you eat helps to protect your cardiovascular health by helping to control blood pressure and reduce your risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-disease/atherosclerosis-when-it-starts" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (hardening of the arteries) and helps to prevent excess weight gain,” Smart concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Healthline</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 19:58:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPUV9EZC1XQ25HUUg0RkdnbHBFV1VZQmZ3Vm9ubGlWVWRjajduRzhtT0prOHgwd0UxQUwxcWpHUlF2c2M0Z1laUlRzbkVKMG5lZTVpRWgxTFZTZ2liR1FNV3FwSVR6akVFVmowSEl5WGR2TUM1aXUxQlNVajBjU09xQi14eU5VRHFHS2dOVHREdWk5REp1bXUzOU9XNi10R3RIQ1E4d0FSdjI</guid></item><item><title>一名儿童在美国购物中心患有麻疹，涉及不知道来源的州卫生官员- Star Tribune | A child had measles at Mall of America, concerning state health officials who don’t know source - Star Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiywFBVV95cUxNNkd5RzRwVUZxMDVXMWZqZHR3WEhTUDJ2S0tad3g2YjYxckpSUnV5Z19QMmhhaVhXTFE2dWFyRlZvcXZieWRlaXRRQ3Nnb0RUbkxPQ3hyUk10SElpMzE0N2U4QWV1UjVMNmNRcUpyVlpRNGhZOGJpOEd1MElSV0ozTV9PSHp0X1V1YjBhSERXYmV4RkRPeUhYOXFmdDRWYXk4c3ctYXZFRDhza3dPTDRhUXlzMTNTOUZHUnBiMGViTUZDMUZQdkNBeFZHVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;“Every once in a while, we do see someone that remembers something that they forgot to share with us,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;The state once had one of the highest vaccination rates in the U.S., but last fall it had one of the lowest rates of &lt;a href="https://www.startribune.com/as-measles-spreads-nationwide-fewer-minnesota-kindergartners-are-vaccinated-for-mmr/601336566" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.startribune.com/as-measles-spreads-nationwide-fewer-minnesota-kindergartners-are-vaccinated-for-mmr/601336566"&gt;children vaccinated for measles&lt;/a&gt; entering kindergarten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Angst among parents over the COVID-19 vaccines has resulted in skepticism of other vaccines, including the highly protective MMR vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella that is usually administered in two doses around 12 months and four years of age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Nationwide, more than 1,000 infections and three deaths have been reported this year, largely among unvaccinated children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Smaller than a pinpoint, the tiny invertebrates, which measure about 0.15 millimeters to 0.4 millimeters in length, live around the outer parts of hair follicles and feed on their oily contents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“While we are &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/26/health/snooze-alarm-waking-sleep-wellness"&gt;sleeping&lt;/a&gt;, they come out and are very happy, mating, visiting relatives, walking on our faces. The moment we wake up, they go back inside the pore,” said Alejandra Perotti, an associate professor of invertebrate biology at the University of Reading in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re creeped out, Perotti said, “don’t be.” Demodex mites are more often friends than foes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In exchange for cleaning the gunk out of our pores, we offer these miniature vacuums our melatonin, a hormone produced in the skin that puts us to sleep but gives the mites vital energy, Perotti said. And like microscopic vampires, the mites have evolved to avoid ultraviolet rays from the sun, which easily destroys their DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The face typically has up to five mites per square centimeter — although without putting a sample of skin under a microscope, it’s impossible to see them with the naked eye.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your immune system weakens, the mite populations can sometimes overproduce, leading to a host of skin and eye conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;When they ‘mite’ cause problems&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Demodex mites can multiply overnight, causing an overgrowth called demodicosis, said Dr. Richard Locksley, professor of medicine at University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Immunodeficient individuals, such as older adults or people on chemotherapy, are more vulnerable to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22775-demodex-face-mites"&gt;demodicosis&lt;/a&gt; and may have an inflammatory response to the mites and the bacteria that can colonize them, Locksley said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not totally known why some people experience inflammation from the mites, Locksley said. “But what is known is that wild animals don’t have any diseases from the mites, but domestic dogs and cats do. So perhaps when we moved into a different environment, and the way we evolved, a genetic mutation compromised our immune pathways.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The inflammation can manifest as rosacea, acne, dryness and flaking, especially on the cheeks, eyelids, forehead and creases where oil may accumulate, said Dr. Roberto Ricardo-Gonzalez, associate professor of dermatology at University of California, San Francisco, who worked closely with Locksley to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36044899/"&gt;research the mites.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To determine whether demodex mites are the cause of skin irritations, dermatologists can tape or lightly scrape the top layer of skin and place the sample under a microscope, Ricardo-Gonzalez said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During a routine eye exam, the doctor may check for a waxy buildup of demodex eggs and waste around the base of the eyelashes. said Dr. Cory Lappin, an Ohio optometrist. For patients with eyelid infections, this buildup is a common cause of dryness, itchiness, eyelash loss and even recurrent sties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Preventing and treating overgrowth&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;For most healthy adults, there is no need to panic about demodex mites.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Most people are completely unaware they have the mites, and (it) should stay that way,” Locksley said. “You could do more harm picking around looking for problems than just being agnostic about it. And if you have problems, you should go talk to a physician first.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both Lappin and Ricardo-Gonzalez recommend maintaining a regular hygiene routine before bedtime, including a gentle cleanser to remove debris and excess oil from the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take off eye makeup and false lashes before sleep as well to keep the area clean and avoid irritating the delicate tissue around the eye, Lappin said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those with acne-prone skin can use a topical retinoid one or two nights a week, Ricardo-Gonzalez said, noting that moderation is key to a bedtime skin care routine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’ve seen it in patients when you have moisture-barrier disruption, meaning your skin is overly dry or overproducing oil from inflammation or excessive washing. The mites can overgrow in those instances,” Ricardo-Gonzalez said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regular, adequate sleep is also important to prevent skin from overproducing sebum, the oily substance that’s like food for the mites, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9907625/"&gt;studies have shown.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To treat demodicosis, a dermatologist might prescribe topical or oral &lt;a href="https://www.jaadcasereports.org/article/S2352-5126(24)00276-5/fulltext"&gt;ivermectin&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the populations back to normal counts, Ricardo-Gonzalez said. It’s not possible, though, to completely rid yourself of the mites permanently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/drug-trials-snapshots-xdemvy#:~:text=The%20FDA%20approved%20XDEMVY%20based,833%20patients%20with%20Demodex%20blepharitis."&gt;US Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; approved medicated eye drops in 2023 to treat demodex-related eyelid inflammation, Lappin said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Here today, gone tomorrow?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Observed on humans for centuries, demodex mites are thought to be passed from contact with our mothers shortly after birth. Perotti and her research team &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/39/6/msac125/6604544?login=false"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, however, that these symbiotic creatures may be experiencing what she calls “a long-term evolutionary death.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When you have organisms that are exposed to this symbiotic life, it leads to genome erosion, or a loss of genes over time,” Perotti said. “We predict that this will continue to the point that (the mites) will disappear.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With no predators, external threats or competitors, demodex mites have no selective pressures, Perotti explained. And since they are passed down between related humans, the populations lack genetic diversity — in other words, they are inbred.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s unknown how long the extinction will take, but to Perotti, this is nothing to celebrate — or mourn — considering humans will likely adapt to need demodex mites less as they die out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There has been very bad talk about the mites for a long time. They have been blamed for a lot of problems, but the suppressed immune system is the problem, not the mite itself,” Perotti said. “We should think of them as our companions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>East Idaho News</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 19:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQQXA2eHI0a3VYcmx1a2FXbF8xM1JPNzFMc2otWlVXVUJlVlFld0phN29JVzJUVS1ZNGd3V1l2TUVqZFBJNm52T2htMGV2cnhiZUt6dEhjVi0yTEY4azQteEJWbnNhczBqSklSSno0RmdUbm13VmZla1JRTjROWTFWTjUtVlF6eWM4T1A4dkdIX2VOOVpkNXpz</guid></item><item><title>科罗拉多州确认机场相关麻疹疫情又有3例感染- CIDRAP | Colorado confirms 3 more infections in airport-linked measles outbreak - CIDRAP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxOVTFxajliLUN1R2xSR1o4MU55UGxhMzNMQmJ0WXl2NHY3RFUtRTJ0RXNhN3ZuQm8tdVRQX2g2ejhLNWlLMmZQTXo3RzFFZUFIQ3ZTaExtZU55MHd1dFp0dHlZX284NGFobHZhc09KQTd0eWt0RUE3dUY2ZHBOQU5WR3otQXFKbGZEYWpNeFZNZHlLXzFqS3ZRUHFxUHZDcGhZay16LQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Colorado Department of Public Health (CDPH) and their partners in El Paso and Arapahoe counties have &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/press-release/colorado-public-health-officials-release-additional-locations-for-potential-measles"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; three more measles cases linked to exposure at Denver International Airport and on a Turkish Airlines flight, raising the outbreak total to six.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the CDPH said the three new cases include two unrelated unvaccinated adults from El Paso County who were at the airport around the same time on May 14. The third is a vaccinated adult from Arapahoe County who arrived at the airport on a Turkish Airlines flight on May 13. The first patient in the outbreak is an out-of-state resident who traveled on the flight while infectious. Of the six patients in the cluster, four were on the flight—three Colorado residents and another from out-of-state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;New cases in California, North Dakota, and Minnesota&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In developments in other states, health officials in California’s &lt;a href="https://publichealth.santaclaracounty.gov/news/media-advisory/public-health-departments-santa-clara-county-and-alameda-county-announce-locations-measles-exposure"&gt;Santa Clara County&lt;/a&gt;, located in the San Francisco Bay area, said they and Alameda County officials are investigating a measles infection in an adult who tested positive after international travel, including through a US airport where measles exposure may have occurred. Officials also warned of potential exposure at two grocery stores and a coffee shop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, the &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.nd.gov/immunizations/measles"&gt;North Dakota Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed three more measles cases, including two more from Grand Forks County and another from Williams County, bringing the state’s total to 32 since early May. Four counties have reported cases, and most are from Grand Forks and Williams counties. All of the state’s cases occurred in unvaccinated people, and most (24) were reported in people ages 5 to 19 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/2025/measles060225.html"&gt;Minnesota Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; today reported two more measles cases, bringing the state’s total to four for the year. Both are from the Twin Cities metro area, including a Washington County adult with an unverified vaccination status who was exposed during domestic airline travel outside of Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other is an unvaccinated child from Dakota County who had no known exposure and had not traveled outside the state in the last month, which health officials said suggests that measles could be spreading undetected in the community. The MDH said the child was at the Mall of America theme park while infectious on May 24. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But in a new study, presented today at the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition, scientists have found that coffee may offer the much longer-term benefit of healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The study has not been peer-reviewed or published, but it was rigorous and included a large number of women who were followed for many years. It also adds to a large body of evidence &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/01/well/eat/coffee-study-lower-dying-risk.html" title=""&gt;linking coffee to longer lives&lt;/a&gt; and various health advantages, including lower risks of certain chronic diseases — though all of these studies had limitations, including that they were observational and could not prove cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Still, the results linking coffee to healthier aging were not surprising, said Fang Fang Zhang, a professor of nutritional epidemiology at Tufts University who was not involved with the study. “The data is quite consistent that coffee consumption is actually beneficial,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-13o6u42 eoo0vm40" id="link-241389e7"&gt;What did the new research find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In the study, researchers followed more than 47,000 female nurses for several decades beginning in the 1970s. Every few years, the women answered detailed questions about their diets, including how much coffee, tea and cola (like Coca-Cola or Pepsi) they typically drank. Then, the scientists looked at how many of the women were still alive and met their definition of “healthy aging” in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Just over 3,700 women met that criteria: They were 70 or older; reported good physical and mental health, with no cognitive impairment or memory problems; and were free of 11 chronic diseases such as cancer, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, kidney failure, Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The researchers found a correlation between how much caffeine the women typically drank (which was mostly from coffee) when they were between 45 and 60 years old and their likelihood of healthy aging. After adjusting for other factors that could affect aging, such as their overall diet, how much they exercised and whether they smoked, those who consumed the most caffeine (equivalent to nearly seven eight-ounce cups of coffee per day) had odds of healthy aging that were 13 percent higher than those who consumed the least caffeine (equivalent to less than one cup per day).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Those are signs of possible neuropathy, “a general term for nerve dysfunction in your limbs,” says Eva Feldman, a professor of neurology at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="35B5RILJJNDG7DPBYVRD4XVHNA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The likelihood of neuropathy appears to increase with age. That’s partly because the number of nerve cells in your body declines over the years, and those that remain become less functional. And “if they are damaged by injury or an underlying medical condition, they struggle more to recover,” says Anne Louise Oaklander, an associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="25OPPFITJNGB7KGSQW4SOUFHKI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Chronic conditions such as diabetes, as well as autoimmune disease and treatments such as some kinds of chemotherapy, can cause neuropathy, too, Oaklander says. Long-term untreated hypothyroidism, kidney disease and obesity also can increase the risk, according to the Mayo Clinic. Another potential cause is &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/supplements/supplements-that-might-actually-help-you-a6441144119/" target="_blank"&gt;vitamin B12 deficiency&lt;/a&gt;, which is thought to affect at least 20 percent of adults over age 60, says Kunal Desai, an assistant professor of neurology at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. Here’s what to do if you think you have neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="N5PFRVWKWFG5TASIAFIG45VCVA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="N5PFRVWKWFG5TASIAFIG45VCVA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Spotting the signs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VU3QXHFEKFA6PLU4MNONKWKM6E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Tingling or painful sensations in your hands and/or feet are the main symptoms. “Patients often describe it as feeling like ants crawling on their feet, or even as prickling or burning,” Feldman says.

They’ll test your reflexes and might use a tuning fork in the area to see whether you can feel the vibration or prick you with a pin to see whether you feel pain. They might check the strength in your hands and feet, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NP754FUZ4ZHRPASNM7H3RDJBVE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If any results are abnormal, you’ll probably have tests of your nerves for confirmation and, if those results are abnormal, blood tests to check for contributing conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, Oaklander says. If the neuropathy is on only one side or is worse on one side, Feldman says, you’ll need to see a neurologist to rule out more serious conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="LABFAZMGDBHIZMBJWZGRYL4JWM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="LABFAZMGDBHIZMBJWZGRYL4JWM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Finding relief&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JRNMGGA43BDDRCSEYZKUOEBXTA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;How your neuropathy is treated usually depends on the cause, Feldman says. If it’s Type 2 diabetes, exercise and weight loss, if needed, can improve symptoms, according to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10112836/" target="_blank"&gt;2022 review in the journal Lancet Neurology&lt;/a&gt;. Neuropathy due to an autoimmune disorder, hypothyroidism or a vitamin B12 deficiency often eases once the underlying condition is corrected. If it’s caused by chemotherapy, your doctor may change your regimen or advise a treatment break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SWDIQJPD7VHFZAK6XPSM3RHXPI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If those steps aren’t enough, medication may help. The American Academy of Neurology advises trying tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as duloxetine (Cymbalta) and venlafaxine (Effexor ER) or gabapentinoids like gabapentin (Neurontin and others). A topical prescription capsaicin patch helps, but it can cause a rash or burning sensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BWZ6K56U7FEXBF2JDTZAFQAPXQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you have foot neuropathy, you should see a podiatrist several times a year to have your feet checked for sores, ulcers and signs of infection.

These teens reported higher negative urgency and lower perseverance, meaning they were more likely to act rashly under stress and abandon difficult tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, no link was found between biological circadian timing and impulsivity, suggesting psychological or behavioral influences may play a greater role. The study involved 210 teens and highlights the potential for chronotherapeutic interventions to reduce impulsivity-related risks during adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evening Preference &amp;amp; Impulsivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Teens who prefer late sleep and wake times show higher impulsivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Biological Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Dim light melatonin onset did not predict impulsivity levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention &lt;strong&gt;Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Targeting sleep patterns may help reduce teen risk behaviors like substance use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AASM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study to be presented at the SLEEP 2025 annual meeting found that adolescents who prefer to sleep and wake up later (“night owls”) reported greater impulsivity than those who prefer to sleep and wake up earlier (“morning larks”).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results show that adolescents with self-reported evening preference, or “night owl” tendencies, reported greater negative urgency and lack of perseverance, which are two aspects of impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110568"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/impulsivity-circadian-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/impulsivity-circadian-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/impulsivity-circadian-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/impulsivity-circadian-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/impulsivity-circadian-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/impulsivity-circadian-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/impulsivity-circadian-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/impulsivity-circadian-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows people working at night and day." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/impulsivity-circadian-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/impulsivity-circadian-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/impulsivity-circadian-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/impulsivity-circadian-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/impulsivity-circadian-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/impulsivity-circadian-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/impulsivity-circadian-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;During a week-long protocol, participants also wore a wrist actigraph to estimate sleep midpoint and duration, and at bedtime they completed an assessment of impulsivity. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that they were more likely to act impulsively when experiencing negative emotions and quit difficult tasks. In contrast, there was no association between objectively measured circadian phase and impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Surprisingly, we did not find a significant link between dim light melatonin onset and impulsivity in our sample,” said lead author Riya Mirchandaney, who is a doctoral candidate in clinical-health psychology at the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that there may be unmeasured psychological or behavioral factors influencing both impulsivity and the self-assessment of circadian preference, regardless of the timing of an individual’s internal circadian clock.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, circadian rhythms are internal biological rhythms that exist in all living organisms. This timekeeping system, or “body clock,” is synchronized to the 24-hour, light-dark cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Circadian preference reflects an individual’s desired timing of sleep and wake, and circadian timing can be objectively measured by analyzing saliva or blood plasma to detect dim light melatonin onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 210 adolescents across two studies. They had a mean age of 17 years, and 60.5% were female.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed self-reported measures of impulsivity and circadian preference. Laboratory samples of saliva were taken to assess circadian phase by determining dim light melatonin onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a week-long protocol, participants also wore a wrist actigraph to estimate sleep midpoint and duration, and at bedtime they completed an assessment of impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mirchandaney emphasized that the results could influence future research to help teens avoid the negative effects of impulsivity, which is a well-established contributor to alcohol and substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adolescence may be a prime opportunity for preventing adverse outcomes associated with impulsivity using chronotherapeutic interventions to advance sleep and circadian timing,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was supported by grants from the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism within the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this impulsivity, neurodevelopment, and circadian rhythm research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aasm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hannah Miller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aasm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AASM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Hannah Miller – AASM&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will be presented at SLEEP 2025&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 19:31:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE03REdvUENMVC13UkRoajEtd3pWOXh5UkM3RnY3NGtPems5WEVseGhaeVV0WlZLRmFSZUJLSHJzOXA0dHBaaVMzNU1LYVhhYXRhVUNxc3lhT2EwakJ1dWJfVVkwS2Q3SnZETGc</guid></item><item><title>科学家偶然发现世界上最古老的胃石化石--银河日报 | Scientists Stumble Upon The World’s Oldest Stomach Stone Fossil - The Daily Galaxy</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE4xMGgtWHBMNHV3aEVlU3pfS25OVUFlR21BbGh1azdkcEJWc0xPQ3FibzBDWW16WE5ORXVKOG9jcGkxY3I1LVNjYlBXVndhUnU5S2t1Um12Z1VONXVZaC11QUdEUGN0M2xzanhiX3p1RnM3X0xjX1BxYVpTMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paleontologists have discovered what is believed to be the &lt;strong&gt;oldest stomach stone fossil&lt;/strong&gt;, dating back approximately &lt;strong&gt;150 million years&lt;/strong&gt;. This remarkable find was made on England’s renowned &lt;strong&gt;Jurassic Coast&lt;/strong&gt;, a UNESCO World Heritage Site famous for its extensive geological history spanning the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods. The detailed study of this specimen was published recently in a peer-reviewed article in the&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016787823000421?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Geological Society&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Rare Discovery Along The Jurassic Coast&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Jurassic Coast&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Site &lt;/a&gt;stretching nearly 100 miles from East Devon to Dorset, is renowned for its rich and continuous geological history covering the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods. It is in this dramatic landscape, specifically in Kimmeridge, Dorset, that Dr. Steve Etches MBE &lt;strong&gt;unearthed the 150-million-year-old &lt;/strong&gt;stomach stone. This discovery significantly extends the known fossil record of calculi, such as stomach and bladder stones, by almost 59 million years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/ancient-roman-boundary-stone-discovered-israel/" data-type="post" data-id="77451"&gt;stones&lt;/a&gt;, known as gastroliths, are typically formed in the digestive systems of animals, but identifying the exact species they originated from is often a challenge without direct skeletal association. &lt;a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/news/2023/Research-News/Nigel-Larkin-Dorset-Stomach-Stone" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Nigel Larkin&lt;/a&gt;, a paleontologist and Visiting Research Fellow at the University of Reading, explained the difficulty in identifying the source of these stones: “Unless stomach stones are actually f&lt;strong&gt;ound preserved within a skeleton&lt;/strong&gt; it is almost impossible to tell what sort of animal it might have formed inside.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Insights into Prehistoric Marine Reptiles&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The size of the stomach stone, combined with its geological context in Upper Jurassic clay, strongly suggests it formed inside a large marine reptile. Larkin pointed out that it likely belonged to creatures such as an &lt;strong&gt;ichthyosaur&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; plesiosaur&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;pliosaur,&lt;/strong&gt; or even an &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/12-million-year-old-crocodile-fossil-found-in-peru-what-it-reveals-about-a-lost-world/" data-type="post" data-id="77648"&gt;ancient crocodilian&lt;/a&gt;. He emphasized that the stone did not come from a dinosaur, as dinosaurs were terrestrial animals, but underlined the find’s significance: “The stomach stone did not come from a dinosaur – as dinosaurs lived on land – but this is still a very exciting and rare discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ivan Sansom, Senior Lecturer in Palaeobiology at the University of Birmingham, conducted detailed microscopic analyses to confirm the &lt;strong&gt;stone’s structure and composition&lt;/strong&gt;. His research concluded the specimen possesses all the characteristics typical of a calculus formed within a gastrointestinal tract, confirming it as a genuine stomach stone fossil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Fossilized Stomach Stones Expose Ancient Diets&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gastroliths&lt;/strong&gt; have been found in a variety of extinct and extant animals, serving different roles such as aiding digestion or providing ballast for aquatic creatures. The discovery of this exceptionally old stomach stone adds a new chapter to our understanding of how &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/sea-monster-morocco-carinodens-acrodon/" data-type="post" data-id="75903"&gt;marine reptiles&lt;/a&gt; from the Jurassic seas processed their food. It implies these animals used gastroliths similarly to some modern species, grinding food in their stomachs or stabilizing their buoyancy in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The fossil’s preservation and age make it a valuable record for paleontologists, offering a rare glimpse into the physiology and behavior of marine reptiles living 150 million years ago.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRATTLEBORO — Great-great-grandmother &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2025/05/11/this-94-year-old-vermonter-is-the-great-great-grandmother-of-all-fundraisers/"&gt;Shirley Squires&lt;/a&gt; is also a great, great fundraiser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 94-year-old Guilford resident arrived at Saturday’s &lt;a href="https://www.aidsprojectsouthernvermont.org/"&gt;AIDS Project of Southern Vermont&lt;/a&gt; charity walk with four generations of family, including the newest member born just two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though rain forced organizers to cancel the annual outdoor stroll, Squires still shined, raising $22,291 in contributions this year to reach a lifetime fundraising milestone of $500,298.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your unwavering commitment is nothing short of extraordinary,” U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vermont, wrote to Squires in a letter read at Brattleboro’s Centre Congregational Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squires first learned of the AIDS walk in 1992 when her son — state Rep. Ronald Squires, the first Vermont lawmaker to reveal his homosexuality — spoke at it shortly after winning passage of a statute prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can teach our children how to prevent AIDS or we can sit and watch them die,” the Democratic legislator told the Town Crier at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 41-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/09/obituaries/ron-squires-dies-at-41-lawmaker-in-vermont.html"&gt;died of the disease&lt;/a&gt; in January 1993. Five months later, his mother joined the walk to raise money in his memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" data-attachment-id="623734" data-permalink="https://vtdigger.org/2025/06/02/94-year-old-vermont-charity-walker-reaches-500000-milestone/vtd-vt-mother-4/" data-orig-file="https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/VTD-VT-mother-4-scaled.jpg" data-orig-size="2560,1920" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"FinePix XP130 XP131 XP135","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1740938590","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"400","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="VTD VT mother 4" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Shirley Squires, 94, of Guilford holds the latest of her four generations of descendants, 2-week-old Grace.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After the painful loss of my brother, a tragedy that would have broken many, my mom chose to turn grief into action,” Diana Squires recalled Saturday alongside many of her mother’s 74 children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since starting in 1993, the matriarch has yet to miss a year of fundraising — continuing even this winter, when she broke her shoulder before she was set to handwrite 500 solicitation letters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIDS, once considered a death sentence, is now a treatable condition that about 750 Vermonters are living with through help from the Brattleboro-based service organization, along with &lt;a href="https://vtcares.org/"&gt;Vermont CARES&lt;/a&gt; and the Upper Valley’s &lt;a href="https://www.h2rc.org/"&gt;HIV/HCV Resource Center&lt;/a&gt;, according to the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To honor Squires’ half-million-dollar milestone, the AIDS Project is renaming its annual fundraiser the Ron and Shirley Squires AIDS Walk. Its top finisher promised to be back next year after celebrating her 95th birthday in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I will keep doing this until I’m not here anymore,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ST PAUL, Minn. — The Minnesota Department of Health has confirmed two new &lt;a href="/article/news/local/minnesota-reports-first-measles-case-of-2025/89-ca48893e-8de0-4a0e-954c-5da5bc03239d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;cases of measles&lt;/a&gt;, including a case involving community exposure at the Mall of America.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MDH investigators say a child was infectious while visiting the indoor theme park at the Mall of America on May 24. People who were at the mall between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. that day may have been exposed to the virus and should monitor for symptoms from May 31 through June 14, according to the MDH news release.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials continue to emphasize the importance of getting vaccinated for measles, which is the best defense against the virus. Children should receive two doses: the first between 12 and 15 months of age and the second between ages 4 and 6. Infants as young as 6 months can receive the vaccine early if travel puts them at higher risk. The Centers for Disease Control says the measles vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles after exposure for those who have received two doses, and 93% effective for those who have received a single dose.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Measles spreads easily, and it finds those who are vulnerable," Jessica Hancock-Allen, director of the infectious disease division at MDH, said in the release. "We are seeing increased measles cases throughout the U.S. and internationally this year. The time is now for families to make sure their children are up to date on their immunizations to protect them from this potentially serious disease."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious illness that spreads through coughing, sneezing, or simply being in the same room as someone infected. The virus can linger in the air for up to two hours. Initial symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes, followed by a rash that usually starts on the head and spreads to the body. Symptoms typically appear eight to 12 days after exposure, with the rash developing two to three days after the onset of fever. People who develop symptoms are advised to call their healthcare provider before visiting a clinic to avoid exposing others. Most people born before 1957 are considered immune due to past infection.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the other unrelated case involved an adult from Washington County with an unverified vaccination status who was exposed during domestic air travel outside Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two new cases bring the state's total to four so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both patients are recovering at home. Health officials are working with local departments and Twin Cities-area locations to notify those who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Anytime we confirm a case of measles unrelated to travel that has no known source it is worrying," Hancock-Allen said in the release. "This is because it could be a sign that measles is spreading in the community undetected by public health and healthcare systems. It is uncertain where the child was exposed and whether others may have been exposed."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, on Monday, the CDC issued a &lt;a href="/video/news/nation-world/cdc-issues-new-travel-warning-for-measles/89-b94865fd-2fea-4da2-8964-c3130ff6ee22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;new warning&lt;/a&gt; urging travelers not to fly unless vaccinated against measles. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

The study was presented as an abstract, but a more in-depth manuscript of the investigation will be submitted for peer review in the coming months, Mahdavi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The women were surveyed in middle age and followed for 30 years to understand their rates of death and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this study, we found that moderate caffeinated coffee consumption during midlife was associated with a higher likelihood of healthy aging 30 years later,” Mahdavi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It’s not just any caffeinated drink&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects were found in caffeinated coffee in particular, according to the research. The same link was not found for tea or decaffeinated coffee — and drinking more cola or other caffeinated sodas was tied to a lower chance of healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This would imply that coffee in particular has health preserving or promoting effects,” said Dr. David Kao, Jacqueline Marie Schauble Leaffer Endowed Chair in Women’s Heart Disease and associate professor of medicine at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical School in an email. “As with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5871637/#:~:text=Higher%20coffee%20intake%20was%20significantly,compared%20to%20exclusive%20coffee%20drinkers%5D." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:other studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt;, they also appear to have found that coffee has a particular benefit over other caffeinated drinks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Drinking one to three cups of coffee daily was associated with lower disease and better cognition in older age, the study showed. - Jacob Wackerhausen/iStockphoto/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, the research is high quality, added Kao, who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is also observational, meaning it is limited in its ability to examine direct cause and effect. The new research can only show that a behavior and an outcome are more likely to occur together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers did take that into account and adjusted for other factors that could link coffee drinking and healthy aging such as lifestyle, demographic and other dietary differences, but it is still possible there is another variable at play, Mahdavi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the link between coffee and healthy aging isn’t surprising –– it is consistent with prior research, Kao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate coffee drinking has been linked before to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/27/health/coffee-heart-benefits-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lower risks of chronic diseases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lower risks of chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt; like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is it time to start drinking coffee?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does this mean you should take on a coffee habit if you don’t have one already? Not necessarily, Mahdavi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Coffee may support longevity, but it’s not a universal prescription — especially for women. Hormonal shifts influence how caffeine is metabolized, so the benefits depend on timing, biology, and individual health,” she said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estrogen inhibits a liver enzyme that is crucial for breaking down caffeine, which means that caffeine may last longer in the body of some people, especially those going through hormonal transitions such as menopause or pregnancy or those using oral contraception, Mahdavi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Midlife, the time period examined in this study, is a life stage marked by hormonal and metabolic shifts for women, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moderate caffeinated coffee consumption — typically one to three cups per day — can be part of a healthy diet for many adults,” Mahdavi said. “However, this should not be taken as a blanket recommendation for everyone to begin or increase coffee intake with the goal of longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one thing, the data can’t say whether increasing coffee consumption would help to preserve health, Kao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In other words, although women who drink 3 cups of coffee/day might have better long-term functioning than non-coffee drinkers, we don’t know if non-coffee drinkers started drinking 3 cups a day, whether they would have better functioning than if they remained non-coffee drinkers,” he said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who needs to watch their coffee intake?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings do suggest that people don’t necessarily need to decrease their coffee consumption in the name of healthy aging, Kao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Coffee is an important and positive part of daily life in many cultures around the world, he said. “For many … the knowledge that a daily coffee or 3 is probably not harmful is welcome news.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, some people do need to watch their coffee consumption, including those with high blood pressure, heart disease, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10867825/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anxiety;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein continues to be a hot topic in the wellness world, and rightfully so!&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Protein is essential for building and repairing muscle, and it also helps with satiety (feeling full) and boosting metabolism,” says &lt;a href="https://www.jamieleerdn.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jamie Lee McIntyre, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. How? “Your body burns more calories digesting protein compared to fats (this is called the thermic effect of food, or TEF),” she explains. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thanks to two large eggs (plus a little protein from the whole wheat bread), this breakfast provides 18 grams of protein per serving—or more, depending on the bread you use. While more research is needed, studies suggest regular egg consumption may reduce your risk of metabolic syndrome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Eggs may also be beneficial for increasing muscle mass, which is one of the main factors &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7937672/how-to-calculate-your-metabolism/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;determining your resting metabolic rate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s High in Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The combo of raspberries, whole grain bread and spinach results in a whopping 7 grams of fiber—25% of the daily value—per serving. Despite being essential for digestive and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-improve-metabolic-syndrome-8742510" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;, most Americans aren’t eating enough fiber, with only about 1 in 20 people meeting the daily recommended amount.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Fiber helps prevent the blood sugar roller coaster that can crash your energy, create more cravings, make you eat more and stall your metabolism,” says &lt;a href="http://www.simplywellnessllc.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Samantha Peterson, MS, RD&lt;/a&gt;. “When blood sugar is stable, your body is more efficient at burning fat for fuel, supporting steady energy, brain focus, higher metabolism, muscle support and hormone balance,” she adds. Certain types of fiber, called prebiotics, are also beneficial for metabolism, thanks to their role in the formation of short-chain fatty acids—byproducts of prebiotic fermentation that play a key role in energy metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Provides Magnesium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-8656021" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; might not be the first nutrient that comes to mind when you think of metabolic health, this micronutrient actually plays a big role in supporting a healthy metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “This is a great breakfast to support your metabolism because spinach is a source of magnesium,” says &lt;a href="https://jenniferawagner.my.canva.site/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jennifer Wagner, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, adding, “Magnesium is an important mineral that helps your body turn food into fuel. Without enough magnesium in your dietary patterns, your metabolism can become sluggish, which can lead to lower energy levels.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What’s more, magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels and combat inflammation, making it a helpful nutrient in the prevention of obesity and other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-metabolic-syndrome-11736662" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;metabolic disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to protein, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7960178/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-eggs-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt; are a convenient source of healthy fats—another micronutrient with metabolism benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Including healthy fats helps balance blood sugar levels and supports metabolic health. These fats are essential for hormone regulation, which is important for metabolism,” explains McIntyre. One serving of this Spinach &amp;amp; Egg Scramble provides 16 grams of fat, with only 4 grams from saturated fat.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-skip-breakfast-8417958" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Eating a nutritious breakfast&lt;/a&gt; is just one piece of the puzzle. Here are three additional strategies for promoting better metabolic health: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Quality Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;: Poor sleep can negatively impact metabolic health. Aim for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-6-hours-of-sleep-enough-8692438" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;7–9 hours of quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; each night to support optimal body functions and hormone regulation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Stress&lt;/strong&gt;: Chronic stress can disrupt hormonal balance and slow down metabolism. Practice &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-relieve-stress-in-10-minutes-8739935" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;stress-relieving activities&lt;/a&gt; like meditation, yoga or deep breathing exercises to help provide grounding and calm.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engage in Regular Physical Activity&lt;/strong&gt;: Incorporating &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-exercise-30-min-every-day-8384757" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;regular exercise&lt;/a&gt; into your routine is a powerful way to support your metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Resistance activities, such as strength training, help build muscle, which increases resting metabolic rate, while aerobic exercises, like running or cycling, boost overall calorie burn. Aim for a combination of both to maximize the benefits and maintain a healthy, active lifestyle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Supporting your metabolism doesn’t have to be overly complicated—it’s about making intentional choices that align with your body’s natural processes.

Traditionally, supplements allow athletes the ability to do more exercise and add lean muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;You may have heard your gym buddy, a co-worker or family member talking about taking a supplement called creatine. It is a billion-dollar supplement that is exploding in popularity, but should you take it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grand View Research expects sales of creatine to explode to over $4 billion at the end of the decade. Sales have more than doubled in the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a number of things that I think are pushing creatine,” said Michael Rivas, dietitian and specialist in sports dietetics with the University of Maryland Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creatine is something your body is creating and naturally storing, according to Rivas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you are supplementing it, all you’re doing is encouraging the body to store more of it,” Rivas said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creatine gives muscles extra energy, including your brain. Traditionally, supplements allow athletes the ability to do more exercise and add lean muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popularity of the supplement, specifically creatine monohydrate, has grown outside the gym because of new studies that show its benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are testing creatine for everything from, you know, the sports performance as we were before, to cognitive benefit. I’ve actually seen a couple studies lately for creatine and menopause as well,” Rivas said. “We’re looking toward creatine either delaying or helping with Alzheimer’s and cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these studies showing the cognitive benefits of creatine are early and based on relatively small samples, but Rivas hopes in the next decade definitive research will emerge touting its benefits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it safe for you to take?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For your average individual with healthy kidney function, perfectly fine,” Rivas said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk to your doctor about a recommended dose.&lt;/p&gt;

If you buy something from one of our links, we may earn a commission.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It isn’t the first year that Canadian wildfires have impacted areas of the United States, with billowing waves of wildfire smoke causing record high ratings of poor air quality and unhealthy conditions. &lt;a href="https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/ha/nfdb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;2023&lt;/a&gt; was one of the worst wildfire seasons in Canada when over &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dekp93l6po" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;42 million acres burned&lt;/a&gt;, turning the New York skyline orange and worsening &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/30/canada-wildfires-air-quality" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;air quality&lt;/a&gt; in areas like Detroit and Washington DC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With wildfire smoking spreading as far south as the &lt;a href="https://weather.com/health/respiratory/video/canadian-wildfire-smoke-still-impacting-air-quality" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Gulf Coast states&lt;/a&gt;, air quality and visibility will be impacted, especially for those at risk like young children and the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wildfire season is occurring earlier and lasting longer due to warmer springs, longer summer dry seasons, drier soil and climate change, according to the &lt;a href="https://weather.com/health/respiratory/video/canadian-wildfire-smoke-still-impacting-air-quality" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;EPA&lt;/a&gt;. The alarming rise in wildfire activity over the past decade has transformed what was once a regional concern into a nationwide health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As wildfire events become more frequent and intense, having the right protective equipment is essential. From properly fitted N95 respirators to air purification systems, investing in a few key products can help safeguard your respiratory health during what experts predict could be another challenging wildfire season ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What causes wildfires to spread?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fire weather relies largely on three main &lt;a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/fire-weather-2023" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;meteorological conditions&lt;/a&gt; to spread wildfires: relative humidity, temperature and wind. We’ve discussed relative humidity (RH) in our &lt;a href="https://weather.com/atmosphere/reviews/news/2024-04-02-best-dehumidifier-guide" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dehumidifier Guide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is expressed as a percentage and represents the amount of water vapor in the air at a given temperature. When relative humidity is low, the air pulls moisture from the land and vegetation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hotter temperatures will also fuel fire weather, with warmer nighttime temperatures decreasing overnight relative humidity. As for the wind, how can a fire burn without oxygen? Wind also increases evaporation and land dryness, and may carry embers that can rapidly spread fires. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How wildfire smoke affects your body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over &lt;a href="https://allergyasthmanetwork.org/allergies/allergy-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;50 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; suffer from seasonal allergies, including hay fever, food and skin allergies, and allergic asthma, while over &lt;a href="https://aafa.org/asthma/asthma-facts/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;28 million&lt;/a&gt; have asthma, a chronic disease that causes inflammation and swelling in the airways, trouble breathing, coughing and pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those with respiratory sensitivities, the fine particulate matter in wildfire smoke presents a serious health threat, and it doesn’t only come from fires in your area – wildfire air pollution can extend hundreds of miles beyond the flames themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/environment/emergency/natural/wildfires.html#:~:text=How%20can%20wildfire%20smoke%20impact,and%20bacteria%2C%20from%20the%20lungs." target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wildfire smoke&lt;/a&gt; is a mix of gasses and fine particulate matter from burning vegetation and other materials. These microscopic particles, measuring 10 microns or smaller (known as &lt;strong&gt;PM10&lt;/strong&gt;) can be inhaled into the lungs, and &lt;a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/inhalable-particulate-matter-and-health" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;fine particulate matter&lt;/a&gt; that are 2.5 microns or less (known as &lt;strong&gt;PM2.5&lt;/strong&gt;, smaller than the average human hair), can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;bloodstream&lt;/a&gt;, triggering lung inflammation and potentially leading to long-term health complications. When combined with seasonal pollen—which climate change has also intensified through longer growing seasons—these environmental pollutants create a perfect storm for respiratory distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to reduce wildfire exposure symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/wildfire-smoke-course/health-effects-attributed-wildfire-smoke" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Short-term risks&lt;/a&gt; to wildfire exposure may cause coughing, wheezing, difficulty breathing, bronchitis, increased risk of asthma and other respiratory distress. If exposed over days or weeks, you may even see reduced lung function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/wildfires/safety/how-to-safely-stay-safe-during-a-wildfire.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, there are a few precautions you can take for proper protection against wildfire smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor air quality in your community, and stay inside as much as possible based on the alerts. You can use The Weather Channel app and Airnow.gov for air quality checks in your area. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use a portable air cleaner (also known as an air purifier) with a HEPA filter to keep air in specific rooms as clean as possible. Avoid burning anything indoors, such as candles, incense or wood. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have to go outside, use a &lt;a href="https://www.airnow.gov/sites/default/files/2021-12/protect-your-lungs-from-wildfire-smoke-or-ash.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;respirator or mask&lt;/a&gt; with the words NIOSH, N95 or P100 printed on it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Best Wildfire Protection Products&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you must brave the outdoors during a wildfire event, a proper safety mask should be worn to help prevent lung irritation. Even staying indoors may not be a sure thing, as a certain amount of home “leakiness” will occur during wildfire and allergy seasons due to opening doors or using &lt;a href="https://weather.com/atmosphere/reviews/best-portable-air-conditioners" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;portable air conditioners&lt;/a&gt; that pull in air from outside.

These PVs act like circuit breakers, briefly reducing their activity to allow learning-related neurons to strengthen connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using optogenetics and virtual reality mazes in mice, researchers found that learning was blocked when PV inhibition didn’t decrease at the right time. The findings challenge the idea that more brain activity always equals more learning and could reshape approaches to Alzheimer’s and memory enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Inhibition:&lt;/strong&gt; Parvalbumin interneurons reduce activity just before learning moments, allowing memory-related circuits to strengthen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Signal:&lt;/strong&gt; The decrease in inhibition predicted a reward before it occurred, revealing how the brain primes itself for learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Improper timing of inhibition may explain memory impairments in Alzheimer’s and learning disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuri Jeong remembers the feeling of surprise she felt during a trip back to South Korea, while visiting her grandmother, who’d been grappling with Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hadn’t seen her in six years, but she recognized me,” said Jeong, a former graduate researcher in the lab of Annabelle Singer in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110560"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows AI representations of neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers found that when PVs reduce their activity, it clears the way for excitatory neurons, which drive brain activity, to strengthen their bonds and reinforce learning. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t expect that. Even though my grandmother struggled to remember other family members that she saw all the time, she somehow remembered me,” Jeong added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It made me wonder how the brain distinguishes between familiar and new experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That experience inspired Jeong to embark on a deep-dive exploration of spatial learning and memory, which has resulted in a new study published this month in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their article, Jeong, Singer, and a team of Georgia Tech researchers explain how the brain rapidly learns and remembers important locations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brain relies on spatial learning to navigate the world, whether it’s finding a shortcut through a new neighborhood or remembering where you parked your car,” said Jeong, the paper’s lead author.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clearing the Way for Learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most research focuses on excitatory neurons in spatial learning. Jeong, Singer, and team went in a different direction, probing the crucial role of inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the team looked at the role of inhibitory neurons called parvalbumin interneurons, or PVs, in the hippocampus — a small part of the brain that helps with learning, memory, and spatial navigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that when PVs reduce their activity, it clears the way for excitatory neurons, which drive brain activity, to strengthen their bonds and reinforce learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think of PVs as a kind of circuit breaker that keeps our brain circuits from going haywire,” said Singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research shows that inhibition isn’t static but plays a much more dynamic role in how we learn and remember. It isn’t just about putting the brakes on to keep our brains in check. It’s about precisely timing the release of inhibition to let the brain rapidly encode important information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used optogenetics — a technique for controlling neurons with light — to manipulate interneurons in real time. They monitored thousands of neurons in the mouse brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As animals ran through a virtual reality maze and learned the location of a reward, PVs decreased activity before the award was even reached. Meanwhile, when the researchers prevented this decrease in inhibition, the animals failed to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised that PVs decreased their firing as animals approach a learned reward zone,” Singer said. “The decrease actually predicted the reward. This challenges the traditional idea that more neural activity always equates to learning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selective Inhibition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has potential implications for Alzheimer’s research, according to Singer, because inhibition is impaired in the disease. She and her team want to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we think of Alzheimer’s, we often think about an overactive brain,” she said. “But it isn’t just a volume problem. It’s a timing and location problem. If inhibition isn’t decreasing in the right place in the right moments, the brain may struggle to form new memories. “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study findings have potential applications for Alzheimer’s, learning disabilities, even techniques to enhance memory through non-invasive brain stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By studying how the healthy brain learns, we’re uncovering fundamental principles that could have far-reaching implications,” said Singer, who plans to explore how PVs function in disease models, going forward. “If we can identify what goes wrong in these circuits, we might find ways to restore normal function and improve spatial learning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Jeong, the research inspired by her grandmother remains personal. Before earning her Ph.D. in neuroscience from Emory in 2023, she got into an auto accident that set her back for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had plenty of time during her recovery to think of her future. Now she uses her neuroscience expertise as a corporate trainer and personal coach under the umbrella of her company, Goals Unhindered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But my first love was research, and this study is a reminder for me that inhibition in the brain, like setbacks in life, isn’t just about stopping activity,” she said. “It’s about learning and shaping new memories, and how we make our way in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this learning and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6300010211190f0611502304021706000b4d060716" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Catherine Barzler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://gatech.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Catherine Barzler – Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08868-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Goal-specific hippocampal inhibition gates learning&lt;/a&gt;” by Nuri Jeong et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal-specific hippocampal inhibition gates learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goal-directed navigation in a new environment requires quickly identifying and exploiting important locations. Identifying new goal locations depends on neural computations that rapidly represent locations and connect location information to key outcomes such as food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the mechanisms to trigger these computations at behaviourally relevant locations are not well understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons in the mouse hippocampal CA3 have a causal role in identifying and exploiting new food locations such that decreases in inhibitory activity around goals enable reactivation to bind goal locations to food outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PV interneurons in the CA3 substantially reduce firing on approach to and at goal locations while food-deprived mice learn to find food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These inhibitory decreases anticipate reward locations as the mice learn and are more prominent on correct trials. Sparse optogenetic stimulation to prevent goal-related decreases in PV interneuron firing impaired learning of goal locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disrupting goal-related decreases in PV interneuron activity impaired the reactivation of new goal locations after receipt of food, a process that associates previous locations to food outcomes such that the mice know where to seek food later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results reveal that goal-selective and goal-predictive decreases in inhibitory activity enable learning, representations and outcome associations of crucial locations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 18:15:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTFBkQURLcU81MU01eU1YaFAtX24yRm56a2MweHRNQkhBQnZDYmFXTkJ6VEt2bzBiV1QxWlF1cURNRnk5VnNCLTYwM0NFYU11VXdDaUk4eXRfRHdvZ0VCa183eUJXU2VrbEZzdjBDbGpHcC1qLWhxYmJOa2Fn</guid></item><item><title>医生对Ozempic、Mounjaro和Wegovy不可逆转的“副作用”发出令人担忧的警告- LADbible | Doctors issue worrying warning about irreversible ‘side effect’ of Ozempic, Mounjaro and Wegovy - LADbible</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxPSkloRXdybTBvOHBQVklscWV0dDNiQWFMRkFWb3FKLW9lWkpVb1hJUTlTX0FWY09LT1J3OXpMdHVUNUg0eUs4Yy1hVXRkV3FFT2MzbEVoSFlNREZsWkRWVXhXT1JPSmU0VWFWV0Z1WEdqSWxDTXhLdC02T3NINlJhRUtMVDk3bk9fYVB3RE1FM0U1Q18tRzdKblAycXQwOU9HRnRZYkdlYlNLSDdIOGhNLTRn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Doctors have issued a warning about a potentially irreversible side effect that could impact anyone taking the likes of Ozempic, Mounjaro and Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Each of the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/drugs"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt; - which are primarily prescribed for those with Type-2 diabetes - contain GLP-1 agonists, which have now been linked to a devastating side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;We have already seen the likes of &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/jeremy-clarkson"&gt;Jeremy Clarkson&lt;/a&gt; open up about the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/entertainment/celebrity/jeremy-clarkson-weight-loss-ozempic-heart-stent-232241-20250330"&gt;terrible impact&lt;/a&gt; Ozempic had on his body as he sought to lose weight - despite the drug in particular not being approved for weight loss here in &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/uk-news"&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt; - but that seemingly isn't putting off more and more of the general public who are turning to these drugs as a surefire way to shed some pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Doctors across the world &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/ozempic-simulation-health-weight-loss-doctor-youtube-763204-20250528"&gt;have already warned about the short-term and long-term complications&lt;/a&gt; that can arise from taking medicines such as these, with the pharmaceutical companies behind them also urging the public to get a genuine prescription before taking them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Doctors are worried about the potential side effect that many have experienced from taking drugs like Ozempic, Mounjaro and Wegovy (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Novo Nordisk, Ozempic's manufacturer, previously told LADbible Group: "Wegovy®▼ (semaglutide injection) and Ozempic® (semaglutide injection) are prescription only medicines and require a healthcare professional to prescribe under strict supervision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But now, doctors and The Royal Osteoporosis Society (ROS) are warning that those who are taking the drugs for illicit reasons could end up losing weight not just in fat, but in vital muscle and bone mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Losing this muscle can impair someone's strength and joint stability, while reduced bone density also raises the risk of osteoporosis, a condition which can cause brittle bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Speaking to LADbible group, Julia Thomson, ROS Nurse Manager and Osteoporosis Specialist Nurse, said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“It has long been recognised that extreme and rapid weight loss can impact negatively on bone and muscle mass, this is a risk regardless of the way in which weight is lost. We are unaware of any other mechanism (other than the weight loss) via which GLP1’s may impact negatively on bone. It is important to remember that there are also many health risks associated with obesity (including osteoporosis).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“A balance is required, but this can only be achieved if these drugs are used under the care of a responsible prescriber such as a GP or recognised online provider. This ensures that GLP1’s are prescribed appropriately to those who need it, weight loss is monitored, and nutritional support is provided. A good well-balanced calcium and protein rich diet is particularly important for bones, and it is vital to stay active and incorporate regular exercise into your routine to ensure that bones stay strong and healthy.

Travelers are at risk of catching the disease if they have not been vaccinated for two full weeks or have not had measles in the past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IN3I43L7V5FKHEKGNBKS2YS5JE"&gt;"Most people who bring measles into the United States are unvaccinated U.S. residents who get infected during international travel," reads a portion of the advisory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="H6FWVI2L2ZEGFICTDN5H3WPTOE"&gt;The CDC says travelers are most at risk of catching measles from being in travel hubs like airports and train stations, public transportation, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events. The CDC recommends travelers seek medical care if they experience symptoms such as rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, or red, watery eyes during or within three weeks of travel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Y5NEIOHSMVG4DOFK4W7S4D256I"&gt;To protect against catching measles, the CDC advises receiving two doses of a measles-containing vaccine. Infants 6–11 months old who are traveling internationally are recommended to receive one dose at least two weeks before travel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5M6RFJW2HBABJJ5SFVHX4KDMBU"&gt;Those older than 11 months should receive two doses of MMR vaccine at least 28 days apart. Anyone who is unsure of their vaccination status should visit their doctor at least six weeks before traveling to ensure they’re fully vaccinated before departing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EICDLGYROJFRXJZUE3BX5CR22I"&gt;Measles can have severe health consequences for those at any age and can lead to serious complications, such as pneumonia (infection of the lungs), encephalitis (swelling of the brain), and death, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:ORHUNOVYHJGOHDJK4IEUWERFKQ" data-fusion-component="ORHUNOVYHJGOHDJK4IEUWERFKQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:ORHUNOVYHJGOHDJK4IEUWERFKQ" data-fusion-component="ORHUNOVYHJGOHDJK4IEUWERFKQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XXB34OBGNBBWVNNXODIO2GU6MI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MLive.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 17:14:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxObkZ2dmFfckZJNE1sQms1UEVKNnRtVk5iVkFrNTJfdGRYYkdKWk43Sm9uQTNWbUNibU5nQ0VPVG14RXUxblUzUXV5Qzk4UTZBMFQwY09waGpXM3ZPc0Z4MWtDRVJBYnBXS0lLcjFLX0FUd1dWMnFIVThrYWRDMGZlWUZSMUt4LXZySFhINjJzano3NFEzNjhUSjB0MXRuSnVSNVBIRkZOSWJTaW43ZHo2c3BXNWZHTUR4RUJWaDRJaUY3dlM20gHYAUFVX3lxTE1JZmI2ak9LSnBSaVQ3XzZzUG41eVNLUHJuTHItSnJITlVwdkxDM3d6SWhJa0RGUzZGVk00TmNsbW9YaEdwaml0VmdPTElnZkpzUEpFTTkwa3Z3LVpUemExNVVpZ2RXNS15ZVFaeXh3Ni02WTNCQmktNS1rQjBCMHdPNHJxZWFWd2RZbG1hbWl1T2xKZm9DNmdtenpNdnd3bml5czk1UW03b3NKVlpxWHQwOU9FdDNCSzFSYVVSdnJ1SUFuMHlWRnpSaXdMU09UeF85S0Eya1lLbA</guid></item><item><title>新西兰营养生物化学家将她的补充剂突破推向市场- Stuff | NZ nutritional biochemist takes her supplement breakthrough to the market - Stuff</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxNQmNkbnlscW5JLVpwWjAtX3FhVDlYNjduVnk3dnhBY0I5b3hUbG1OaWpiclpGYU1EbmZ4NHpneHR5U1NSVGppalI5YXBMc2lHN0dHZllJQW5COEdQQ2pLTHc5a0JCQkZIMm5OT2RWcS1uakZ0Ui14WlF2dFdDbVVFRlR4ZmdVV0FNcXowNTRLZ0FSd1F6WU9LUk9SV3RxOXBEd05qb0V3WF9fRXRJMEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;
