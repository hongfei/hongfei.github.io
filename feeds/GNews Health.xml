            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;The social media trend of mouth taping to improve sleep quality and ultimately boost athletic performance is largely unproven, and potentially dangerous, says Dr. Jennifer Gourdin, a sports medicine physician with Kaiser Permanente in Silver Spring, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mouth taping is when you put a piece of tape across your lips to encourage nose breathing when you’re sleeping,” Gourdin told WTOP. “It’s currently trending on Instagram and TikTok, claiming to improve sleep quality, oxygen levels and reduce snoring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gourdin, whose handle on Instagram and TikTok is @drjthesportsdoc, said many of those engaging in mouth taping are athletes. “This is a big deal in the sports field, because improved sleep quality is associated with improved muscle recovery and improved athletic performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory behind it is that nose breathing during sleep is more efficient, Gourdin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you breathe through your nose, you filter the air. It’s humidified and warm, so you’re less likely to wake up in the middle of the night with dry mouth or bad breath, and you’re less likely to wake up fatigued,” she said. “However, there’s not any strong evidence currently to suggest that this true.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, the practice of mouth taping poses several risks to many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you have something like sleep apnea or some other underlying sleep condition, if you have nasal congestion, a deviated septum, or allergy symptoms, taping your mouth could lead to more restricted breathing,” said Gourdin. “It could also lead to dangerous drops in your oxygen levels while you’re sleeping, and in some individuals, it can also lead to panic attacks or anxiety attacks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0323643" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;May study in the PLOS One journal,&lt;/a&gt; which reviewed 10 studies on mouth taping, found “very minor improvement in certain outcomes” for people with mild sleep apnea. But the research also found that “there are potential serious detrimental health outcomes to those with nasal obstruction,” who use oral taping as a means to ameliorate their mouth breathing, sleep apnea or sleep-disordered breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gourdin said there are currently no FDA-approved mouth tapes that are safe for people to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of resorting to mouth taping, to improve sleep quality, Gourdin suggests trying a cool, calm, dark environment, limiting screen time, and turning of the television and putting your phone away before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Have a sleep routine that you go through every night to help you wind down. Limit your intake of caffeine or alcohol before bed. And, for some patients, sleeping on your side can help improve your breathing,” Gourdin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-breakthrough-mouse-study-hints-at-psychedelic-compound-yielding-possible-anti-aging-drugs"&gt;Breakthrough Mouse Study Hints At Psychedelic Compound Yielding Possible Anti-Aging Drugs&lt;/h2&gt;







&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-octonary-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lab studies found that psilocin, the active form of psilocybin, extended the lifespan of human fibroblast cells by up to 57% while preserving telomere length.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Aged mice given monthly doses of psilocybin showed a 60% better survival rate than untreated mice, with signs of improved fur quality.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The study suggests psilocybin may slow aging at the cellular level by boosting SIRT1, reducing oxidative stress, and preserving DNA stability.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Experts caution that these findings are preliminary and must be tested in humans to confirm safety and benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ATLANTA —&lt;/strong&gt; Magic mushrooms could be the unexpected fountain of youth. A groundbreaking study reveals that psilocybin, the mind-altering compound found in these fungi, might do more than produce psychedelic experiences. The research suggests it could actually help people live longer lives. Researchers have discovered this controversial substance extends cellular lifespan and improves survival rates in aging mice, opening an entirely new frontier in anti-aging research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most research has focused on &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/psilocybin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;psilocybin’s ability&lt;/a&gt; to treat &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/psychedelic-magic-mushrooms-psilocybin-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/psychedelic-therapy-benefits-risks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and other &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/psychedelics-mental-health-mysical-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health conditions&lt;/a&gt;. But this study reveals the compound might be working at a much more fundamental level, literally slowing down the aging process itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There was overwhelming clinical evidence that it has benefits for multiple disease indications,” lead researcher Louise Hecker, PhD, tells StudyFinds. “But very little was known about how it affects the body outside the brain.” Our full Q&amp;amp;A with Dr. Hecker can be found at the end of our article.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;npj Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the research represents the first experimental evidence that psilocybin could function as a “geroprotective agent,” essentially a substance &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anti-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;that protects against aging&lt;/a&gt;. A drug already showing promise for treating mental illness might also help people maintain their health and vitality as they age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hecker, a former associate professor of medicine at Emory University, and her team tested what they call the “psilocybin-telomere hypothesis.” This theory suggests that psilocybin’s remarkable ability to treat a wide range of conditions, from depression to neurodegenerative diseases, might stem from its effects &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/cutting-calories-slow-cell-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;on cellular aging&lt;/a&gt; rather than just brain chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-laboratory-cells-live-57-longer-with-psilocin-treatment"&gt;Laboratory Cells Live 57% Longer With Psilocin Treatment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team examined how &lt;em&gt;psilocin&lt;/em&gt;, the active form of psilocybin that forms when the body breaks down the original compound, affects human cells in laboratory conditions. Using human lung fibroblasts, which are cells that naturally age and stop dividing over time, scientists discovered something remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cells treated with psilocin lived significantly longer than untreated cells. At a moderate dose (10 μM), psilocin extended cellular lifespan by 29 percent. When researchers increased the dose to 100 μM, cells lived 57 percent longer than normal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers write that the psilocin-treated cells remained healthy and active for extended periods, continuing to divide and reproduce normally before eventually reaching the natural end of their lifespan. Importantly, the cells didn’t become &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancerous&lt;/a&gt; — they simply &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/intermittent-fasting-slow-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;aged more slowly.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mechanism behind this cellular age reversal involves several key biological processes. Psilocin increased levels of SIRT1, a protein crucial for regulating cellular aging, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/metabolism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, and stress responses. It also reduced &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/oxidative-stress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt;, the cellular damage caused by harmful molecules called free radicals. And it helped preserve &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/telomeres/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;telomeres&lt;/a&gt;, the protective caps on chromosomes that naturally shorten with age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-mice-show-60-better-survival-rates"&gt;Aging Mice Show 60% Better Survival Rates&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laboratory cell studies can be promising, but the real test came when researchers moved to living animals. The team studied female mice that were 19 months old, roughly equivalent to humans in their &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/older-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;early to mid-60s&lt;/a&gt;. This age was deliberately chosen to test whether psilocybin could work as a realistic anti-aging intervention for older adults.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mice received either psilocybin or a placebo once per month for 10 months. The dosing strategy started with a lower amount (5 mg/kg) for the first treatment, followed by higher doses (15 mg/kg) for the remaining nine treatments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By the end of the study period, 80 percent of the psilocybin-treated mice were still alive, compared to only 50 percent of the control group. That represents a 60 percent improvement in survival rates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond just living longer, the psilocybin-treated mice &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/how-magic-mushrooms-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;appeared healthier&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers observed visible improvements in the animals’ fur quality, including new hair growth and less graying compared to the control group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-psilocybin-slows-aging-at-the-cellular-level"&gt;How Psilocybin Slows Aging at the Cellular Level&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How does a psychedelic compound manage to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;slow aging&lt;/a&gt;? The answer likely lies in psilocybin’s interaction with serotonin receptors, particularly the 5-HT2A receptor. These receptors are distributed throughout the body in various cell types including fibroblasts, neurons, heart cells, immune cells, and blood vessel cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When psilocybin activates these receptors, it appears to trigger an array of cellular changes that promote health and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/longer-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt;. The compound increases production of antioxidant enzymes that protect cells from damage, while simultaneously ramping up SIRT1 activity, a key player in cellular maintenance and repair.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This systemic approach might explain why psilocybin seems effective against such a wide range of conditions. Rather than targeting specific diseases, it may be addressing the underlying aging processes that make people more susceptible to illness in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-major-questions-remain-before-human-use"&gt;Major Questions Remain Before Human Use&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Significant questions remain before this research could translate to human applications. The mouse study used only female mice, so researchers don’t yet know whether &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anti-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the anti-aging effects&lt;/a&gt; apply equally to males. The optimal dosing schedule, age of treatment initiation, and long-term safety of repeated psilocybin use for aging also need further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Safety considerations are particularly important given that some research suggests delayed cellular aging could theoretically affect cancer risk, though the current study found no evidence of this problem. The researchers noted that treated cells eventually stopped dividing naturally rather than becoming cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/psilocybin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Psilocybin&lt;/a&gt; remains a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States, making research difficult and clinical use currently impossible outside of approved trials. The doses used in the mouse study were based on amounts given to humans in clinical trials for other conditions, but optimal anti-aging doses haven’t been established.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the research opens an entirely new avenue for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;aging research&lt;/a&gt; and potentially therapeutic intervention. The idea that a single compound could address multiple aspects of aging — from cellular health to oxidative stress to DNA protection — is certainly a change to the typical approaches that target individual age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Given the plethora of positive clinical outcomes already observed for &amp;gt;150 clinical trials, I am very confident that these findings can eventually be translated to humans,” says Hecker, who is now an associate professor at Baylor College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than waiting for people to develop specific conditions and then treating those diseases individually, psilocybin could potentially be used to slow the aging process itself. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/magic-mushrooms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Magic mushrooms&lt;/a&gt;, once relegated to counterculture experimentation, may hold keys to helping humanity live longer, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; This article summarizes findings from an early-stage preclinical study. The results were obtained in laboratory cells and aged mice and have not yet been tested in humans. Psilocybin remains a controlled substance in many countries and is not approved for anti-aging use outside of regulated clinical trials&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What first sparked your team’s interest in testing psilocybin for aging rather than psychiatric conditions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LH:&lt;/strong&gt; My workout buddy kept asking me questions about psilocybin. Non-scientists always think scientists know everything about all things science. But I initially knew nothing about psilocybin. So I told him I would do some reading on pubmed – the only acceptable platform for scientists to find information. I was immediately blown away by what was known and also what was not known about psilocybin. There was overwhelming clinical evidence that it has benefits for multiple disease indications. But very little was known about how it affects the body outside the brain. One paper (based on an idea) stood out on the “psilocybin-telomere hypothesis” – which postulates that psilocybin interventions may quantifiably impact telomere length. I thought that this could offer a potential explanation for its efficacy across a wide range of clinical indications. This hypothesis is based on a large corpus of studies linking mental health biological aging markers: positive psychological states are associated with longer telomeres and negative psychological states are associated with shorter telomeres. But this “theory” had no scientific evidence to support it. I realized, I can actually test this!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the biggest surprise when you saw the cell lifespan results?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LH:&lt;/strong&gt; That psilocybin treatment led to such a dramatic impact on cellular life extension and increased survival in aged mice, even when administered late in life. Also that the mice “looked” healthier – that grew back hair and white hair grew back in black.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How confident are you that these effects might translate to humans?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LH:&lt;/strong&gt; Given the plethora of positive clinical outcomes already observed for &amp;gt;150 clinical trials, I am very confident that these findings can eventually be translated to humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could psilocybin’s impact on SIRT1 and oxidative stress explain its mental health benefits too?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LH:&lt;/strong&gt; Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think the telomere-preserving effects could have side effects, such as increased cancer risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LH:&lt;/strong&gt; This is certainly a risk and something that we need to carefully monitor moving forward. Additional studies are needed to evaluate this.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you respond to concerns about repeated psychedelic use in an aging population?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LH:&lt;/strong&gt; An effective anti-aging treatment that could be administered to adults during late life could have significant clinical potential. The dose utilized in mice was modeled based on a clinical trial in patients ranging from 29 and 70 years (three patients were &amp;gt;65 years), where no serious adverse events were reported at the study endpoint or the post-study follow-up (98 days)&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x#ref-CR24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; These findings support the feasibility of psilocybin treatment in older adults. Further, the FDA’s designation of psilocybin as a “breakthrough therapy” underscores its safety profile, as minimal adverse effects have been reported &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x#ref-CR25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x#ref-CR26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x#ref-CR27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x#ref-CR28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. However, additional studies are warranted to identify optimized protocols for therapeutic efficacy, including the age of treatment initiation, frequency and dose of treatments, and to determine if treatment impacts maximal lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the biggest regulatory or funding barriers you face to moving this to a human trial?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LH:&lt;/strong&gt; The schedule I designation remains a significant barrier for research and subsequently clinical development. Further, this impacts funding. The overwhelming majority of psilocybin studies have been from private funding or foundations rather than federal funding. This unfortunately limits research progress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you wish the public would understand about the real state of psilocybin science?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LH: &lt;/strong&gt;That what we already know about psilocybin is quite amazing! But there is so much more that we do not understand about how it works and it’s potential. It will be important for the federal government to recognize the importance of such work to help propel research progress forward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anything else you’d like to add?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LH:&lt;/strong&gt; This is such an exciting finding, and we hope to share more of our findings with the public soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted both laboratory cell studies and animal experiments to test psilocybin’s effects on aging. In cell studies, they treated human lung and skin fibroblasts with psilocin at various doses and measured how long the cells continued to divide before reaching senescence. For animal studies, they gave 19-month-old female mice either psilocybin or placebo once monthly for 10 months, starting with 5 mg/kg for the first dose and using 15 mg/kg for subsequent treatments. The researchers measured survival rates, observed physical changes, and analyzed various cellular markers of aging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Psilocin treatment extended cellular lifespan by 29% at moderate doses and 57% at higher doses in laboratory studies. The treated cells showed delayed senescence, increased SIRT1 levels, reduced oxidative stress, and preserved telomere length. In mice, psilocybin treatment resulted in 80% survival compared to 50% in the control group, along with visible improvements in fur quality and reduced graying. The effects appeared to work through serotonin receptor activation and involved multiple anti-aging pathways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study used only female mice, so sex-specific effects remain unknown. The research was exploratory in nature, and researchers were not blinded to treatment groups due to logistical constraints with handling a controlled substance. The optimal dosing schedule, treatment duration, and long-term safety of repeated psilocybin use for anti-aging purposes require further investigation. The study also didn’t measure maximum lifespan effects or determine the ideal age for treatment initiation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was supported by the Imagine, Innovate and Impact (I3) Award from Emory School of Medicine, the Georgia CTSA NIH award, a grant from the Emory Woodruff Health Sciences Center for Health in Aging, and Veterans Administration Health System funding. The authors declared no competing interests. Psilocybin and psilocin were obtained from Cayman Chemical under a DEA license.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-publication-information"&gt;Publication Information&lt;/h4&gt;

I usually collect a three-month prescription. But before my clinic closed, they gave me nine months' worth of medication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She will run out of antiretrovirals (ARVs) in September, and then plans on going to her local public hospital for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A former sex worker, the 54-year-old found out she was HIV-positive after she'd quit the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ten years ago she got a chesty cough, and initially thought it was tuberculosis. She went to a doctor who told her she had a chest infection and treated her for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But when the treatment failed, she went to a clinic to get an HIV test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"By then I already assumed that I was HIV-positive, and I told the nurse this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She was right, and she has been on ARVs ever since. We're not using her real name at her request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She currently works as a project coordinator for an NGO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We help pregnant sex workers get their ARVs, to ensure their children are born HIV-negative. We also do home visits to make sure that the mothers take their medication on time, and to look after their babies when they go for their monthly check-ups."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Many HIV-positive sex workers in South Africa relied on private clinics funded by the US government's now-defunct aid agency, USAID, to get their prescriptions and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But most of the facilities closed after US President Donald Trump cut most foreign aid earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In a  report due to be released on Thursday, the UN body in charge of fighting HIV/Aids does not single out the US, but says that drastic cuts from a number of donors have sent shockwaves around the world, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2025/july/20250710_global-aids-update-media-advisory" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the "phenomenal progress" in tackling the illness risks being reversed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"New HIV infections have been reduced by 40% since 2010, and 4.4 million children have been protected from acquiring HIV since 2000. More than 26 million lives have been saved," UNAIDS says, warning that if the world does not act, there could be an extra six million new HIV infections and four million Aids-related deaths by 2029.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Gugu believes that many sex workers could be discouraged from going to public hospitals for their HRVs..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The problem with going to public hospitals is the time factor. In order to get serviced at these facilities, you have to arrive at 4 or 5am, and they may spend the whole day waiting for their medication. For sex workers, time is money," Gugu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She adds that she recently went to her local clinic with some friends to register her details and build a relationship with staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The nurse who attended to us was very rude. She told us there was nothing special about sex workers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She thinks this could lead to many sex workers defaulting on their medication, "especially because their hospital files contain a lot of personal information, and the concern is that sometimes the nurses at these local clinics aren't always the most sensitive in dealing with this kind of information."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;According to the UN, the US cuts to HIV funding could reverse some of the gains made by what has been called one of the most successful public health interventions in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Scientists in the UK-based &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01186-9/fulltext" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Lancet medical journal&lt;/a&gt; last month estimated that USAID funding directly reduced Aids deaths by 65%, or 25.5 million, over the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250701-150711-e3d94715db-web-2.24.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Standing at a podium, George W.

The money was used for various projects, including running mobile clinics to make it easier for patients to get treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Trump administration's cuts have raised concern that infection rates could spike again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I think we're going to start seeing an increase in the number of HIV infections, the number of TB cases, the number of other infectious diseases," Prof Lynn Morris, Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Johannesburg's Wits University, tells the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"And we're going to start seeing a reversal of what was essentially a real success story. We were getting on top of some of these things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Gugu points out that treatment is a matter of life and death, especially for vulnerable populations like sex workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"People don't want to default on their ARVs. They're scared that they're going to die if they don't get access to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The cuts have also affected research aimed at finding an HIV vaccine and a cure for Aids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There's the long-term impact, which is that we're not going to be getting new vaccines for HIV," Prof Morris adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We're not going to be keeping on top of viruses that are circulating. Even with new viruses that might appear, we're not going to have the surveillance infrastructure that we once had."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;South Africa has been one of the global leaders in HIV research. Many of the medications that help prevent the virus, and which have benefitted people around the world, were trialled in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This includes Prep (pre-exposure prophylaxis), a medication which stops HIV-negative people from catching the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Another breakthrough preventive drug released this year, Lenacapavir, an injection taken twice a year and that offers total protection from HIV, was also tried in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;South African academic Prof Abdullah Ely is concerned that research will be affected by the US funding cut&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In a lab at Wits University's Health Sciences campus, a small group of scientists are still working on a vaccine for HIV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They are part of the Brilliant Consortium, a group of labs working across eight African countries to develop a vaccine for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We were developing a vaccine test to see how well that works, and then we would trial it on humans," Abdullah Ely, an Associate Professor at Wits University, tells the BBC in his lab. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The plan was to run the trials in Africa based on research carried out by Africans because we want that research to actually benefit our community as well as all mankind."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But the US funding cuts threw their work into doubt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"When the stop order came, it meant we had to stop everything. Only some of us have been able to get additional funding so we could continue our work. It's set us back months, probably could even be a year," Prof Ely says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The lab lacks funding to carry out clinical trials scheduled for later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"That is a very big loss to South Africa and the continent. It means that any potential research that comes out of Africa will have to be tested in Europe, or the US," Prof Ely says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In June, universities asked the government for a bailout of 4.6bn South African rand ($260m; £190m) over the next three years to cover some of the funding lost from the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We are pleading for support because South Africa is leading in HIV research, but it's not leading for itself.

			&lt;p&gt;Sticking to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_diet"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, rich in plants and nuts and low in meat, could drastically reduce your risk of dementia, according to a new study from researchers at Yonsei University in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific studies have long shown how our eating habits can affect &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/decades-long-study-links-red-meat-to-up-to-13-higher-dementia-risk"&gt;our chances of developing dementia&lt;/a&gt;. Backing up those previous findings, the new study digs into this association for four specific types of diet across a large sample size, following up with participants for an average of 13.5 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it's not enough to prove direct cause and effect between these diets and dementia risk, this study does show a strong association. Further down the line, that might help us understand how &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-isnt-the-only-form-of-dementia-an-expert-explains-the-differences"&gt;different types of dementia&lt;/a&gt; get started, and what steps we could take to slow or prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Considering the lack of a definitive cure for dementia, dietary interventions targeting specific food components, overall diet quality, and inflammatory potential offer promising approaches for early prevention," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnha.2025.100564"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-say-this-one-particular-diet-may-slow-the-decline-of-the-brain?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Scientists Say This One Particular Diet May Slow The Decline of The Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at 131,209 individuals aged between 40 and 69 in a public health database, scoring their diets against the Mediterranean diet (MEDAS), the &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/what-to-know-about-mind-diet"&gt;Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay&lt;/a&gt; (MIND) diet, the Recommended Food Score (RFS), and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sticking to any of these four healthy diets was linked to a notable drop in dementia risk – between 21 and 28 percent. RFS adherents showed the best results, followed closely by the MIND diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inversely, participants' diets were also scored against another metric, the Energy-adjusted &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_inflammatory_index"&gt;Dietary Inflammatory Index&lt;/a&gt; (EDII). Higher EDII scores, which indicate pro-inflammatory diets, were linked to a 30 percent increase in dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167168" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167168" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/MediterraneanGraph.jpg" alt="Dementia risk graph" class="wp-image-167168 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/MediterraneanGraph.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/MediterraneanGraph-563x415.jpg 563w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/MediterraneanGraph-600x442.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167168" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The study mapped adherence to diets, including the Mediterranean diet (MEDAS), against the number of dementia cases over time. (Youn et al., &lt;em&gt;J Nutr. Health Aging&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The healthy diets all focus on whole grains, fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts, and poultry. Fried foods, dairy, and meat are discouraged. It's thought that this helps &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sticking-to-the-mind-diet-could-reduce-your-risk-of-developing-dementia"&gt;reduce stress inside the body&lt;/a&gt; and thus protect the brain from harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The associations between dietary patterns and dementia were stronger in older adults and women and varied between the obese and non-obese groups, highlighting the differential impact of dietary patterns across subgroups," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnha.2025.100564"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings underscore the potential of dietary interventions as modifiable factors to reduce the risk of dementia, particularly in vulnerable populations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite plenty of progress in our understanding of dementia in recent years, we're still not sure of its precise causes – though we know that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-nuts-linked-to-lower-risk-of-dementia-study-finds"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-risk-is-strongly-shaped-by-your-mothers-side-study-finds"&gt;genetics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/can-a-healthy-lifestyle-beat-alzheimers-like-documentary-claims"&gt;physical exercise&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-stage-of-sleep-seems-to-be-critical-for-reducing-risk-of-dementia"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; all play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-15-factors-are-linked-to-early-dementia-risk-a-major-study-found"&gt;so many factors&lt;/a&gt; involved, figuring out how conditions such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="167165" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease develop in some people and not others isn't easy. However, each of these studies helps put together a full picture, as well as suggesting practical ways in which we might help reduce our own personal risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study effectively addresses several limitations of previous studies on diet and dementia," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnha.2025.100564"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many earlier studies relied on a single dietary scoring system without comparing multiple dietary patterns, or had relatively short follow-up periods, limiting their ability to assess long-term effects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnha.2025.100564"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2836262"&gt;new review&lt;/a&gt; of antidepressant withdrawal effects – written by academics, many of whom have close ties to drug manufacturers – risks underestimating the potential harms to long-term antidepressant users by focusing on short-term, industry-funded studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is growing recognition that stopping antidepressants – especially after long-term use – can cause severe and sometimes &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2045125320967183?rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&amp;amp;url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org"&gt;debilitating&lt;/a&gt; withdrawal symptoms, and it is now acknowledged by the UK government as a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prescribed-medicines-review-report"&gt;public health issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons this issue took decades to recognise after the release of modern antidepressants onto the market is because medical guidelines, such as those produced by Nice (England's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence), had for many years declared withdrawal effects to be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178125001453?via%3Dihub"&gt;"brief and mild"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This description was based on studies run by drug companies, where people had only taken the medication for eight to 12 weeks. As a result, when patients later showed up with severe, long-lasting symptoms, many doctors &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395623001309?via%3Dihub"&gt;didn't take them seriously&lt;/a&gt; because these experiences contradicted what the guidelines led them to expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/some-antidepressants-could-speed-decline-in-dementia-patients?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Some Antidepressants Could Speed Decline in Dementia Patients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our recent research helps explain this mismatch. We found a clear link between how long someone takes antidepressants and how likely they are to experience withdrawal symptoms – and how severe these symptoms are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We surveyed &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178125001453?via%3Dihub"&gt;NHS patients&lt;/a&gt; and found that people who had used antidepressants for more than two years were ten times more likely to have withdrawal effects, five times more likely for those effects to be severe, and 18 times more likely for them to be long lasting compared with those who had taken the drugs for six months or less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For patients who used antidepressants for less than six months, withdrawal symptoms were mostly mild and brief. Three-quarters reported no or mild symptoms, most of which lasted less than four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167368" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167368" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/antidepressant_withdrawal_pill_642.jpg" alt="woman taking a pill" class="wp-image-167368 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/antidepressant_withdrawal_pill_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/antidepressant_withdrawal_pill_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/antidepressant_withdrawal_pill_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167368" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Withdrawal is milder for those who use antidepressants for less than six months.

Four-fifths of these patients were unable to stop their antidepressants despite trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 2 million people on antidepressants in England have been taking them for over five years, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-65825012"&gt;according to a BBC investigation&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db283.htm"&gt;in the US&lt;/a&gt; at least 25 million people have taken antidepressants for more than five years. What happens to people in eight-to-12-week studies is a far cry from what happens to millions of people when they stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studying what happens to people after just eight to 12 weeks on antidepressants is like testing car safety by crashing a vehicle into a wall at 5km/h – ignoring the fact that real drivers are out on the roads doing 60km/h.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;History repeating itself?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, a review has just been published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2025.1362?utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamapsychiatry.2025.1362"&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Several of the senior authors declare payments from drug companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In what looks like history repeating itself, the review draws on short-term trials – many funded by the pharmaceutical industry – that were similar to those used to shape early treatment guidelines. The authors conclude that antidepressants do not cause significant withdrawal effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their main analysis is based on eleven trials that compared withdrawal symptoms in people who had stopped antidepressants with those who had continued them or stopped taking a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="167350" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;. Six of these trials had people on antidepressants for eight weeks, four for 12 weeks and just one for 26 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They reported a slightly higher number of withdrawal symptoms in people who had stopped antidepressants, which they say does not constitute a "clinically significant" withdrawal syndrome. They also suggest the symptoms could be explained by the "nocebo effect" – where negative expectations cause people to feel worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our view, the results are likely to greatly underestimate the risk of withdrawal for the millions of people on these drugs for years. The review found no relationship between the duration of use of antidepressants and withdrawal symptoms, but there were too few long-term studies to test this association properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review probably underestimates, in our view, short-term withdrawal effects too by assuming that the fact that people experience withdrawal-like symptoms when stopping a placebo or continuing an antidepressant cancels out withdrawal effects from antidepressants. But this is not a valid assumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that antidepressant withdrawal effects overlap with side-effects and with everyday symptoms, but this does not mean they are the same thing. People stopping a placebo report symptoms such as dizziness and headache, because these are common occurrences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as was shown in another &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(24)00133-0/fulltext"&gt;recent review&lt;/a&gt;, symptoms following discontinuation of a placebo tend to be milder than those experienced when stopping antidepressants, which can be intense enough to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11448088/"&gt;require emergency care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So deducting the rate of symptoms after stopping a placebo or continuing an antidepressant from antidepressant withdrawal symptoms is likely to underestimate the true extent of withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167367" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167367" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/antidepressant_withdrawal_hospital_642.jpg" alt="back of an ambulance" class="wp-image-167367 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/antidepressant_withdrawal_hospital_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/antidepressant_withdrawal_hospital_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/antidepressant_withdrawal_hospital_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167367" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some withdrawal effects are severe enough to require emergency care.

For example, an American &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006-3223(98)00126-7"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that more than 60% of people who stopped antidepressants (after eleven months) experienced withdrawal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest that  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="167350" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; after stopping antidepressants is probably a return of the original condition, not withdrawal symptoms, because similar rates of depression were seen in people who stopped taking a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this conclusion is based on limited and unreliable data (that is, relying on participants in studies to report such events without prompting, rather than assessing them systematically) from just five studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope uncritical reporting of a review based on the sort of short-term studies that led to under-recognition of withdrawal effects in the first place, does not disrupt the growing acceptance of the problem and slow efforts by the health system to help potentially millions of people who may be severely affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The authors and publisher of the new review have been approached for comment.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260708/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

(Bill Roth / ADN) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;A man from Peru who was one of roughly 40 federal immigration detainees held in an Alaska jail last month is now hospitalized with tuberculosis in Washington, his attorney said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Word of the case of the highly infectious disease raised questions among prison rights advocates about the scope of a larger potential outbreak.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;State corrections officials on Wednesday said no larger outbreak had taken place, and said the detainees had been thoroughly screened for the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;A spokesperson from the Alaska Department of Corrections said there were “no reported cases of (tuberculosis) in any of our facilities” as of Wednesday afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The man, a Peruvian asylum seeker, was part of &lt;a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2025/06/10/dozens-of-ice-detainees-transferred-to-alaska-are-being-held-at-an-anchorage-facility/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2025/06/10/dozens-of-ice-detainees-transferred-to-alaska-are-being-held-at-an-anchorage-facility/"&gt;a group of about 40 men flown to Anchorage&lt;/a&gt; from a Tacoma regional immigration detention center on June 8 as part of a deal between the state and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to relieve overcrowding amid a nationwide immigration crackdown ordered by the Trump administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The man’s attorney, Sean Quirk, said in an interview Wednesday that the man was housed from about June 8 until June 30 at the Cook Inlet Pretrial Facility with dozens of other detainees. Quirk said he was not notified of his client’s whereabouts&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;during his time in Alaska, when he was transferred out or when he was hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The group was &lt;a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2025/06/30/ice-detainees-held-at-anchorage-jail-have-been-transferred-out-of-state/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2025/06/30/ice-detainees-held-at-anchorage-jail-have-been-transferred-out-of-state/"&gt;flown back to the Tacoma ICE facility on June 30&lt;/a&gt;. The man was taken to the emergency room Monday, one week after he left Alaska, Quirk said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Quirk said he couldn’t reach his client for days and eventually learned he might be hospitalized after the man didn’t appear for a virtual hearing. It took a series of phone calls to hospitals in the Tacoma area to locate his client. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“I started cold-calling hospitals in Tacoma, and I was able to speak to someone,” Quirk said. Eventually he was connected to his client, but not before an ICE agent stationed in a hallway interceded and prevented a nurse from handing the phone over, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It is not clear where the man contracted tuberculosis, how long he had it or who else may have been exposed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that primarily affects the lungs. It can be fatal if untreated, and treatment with antibiotics takes months. Alaska’s tuberculosis rates are &lt;a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2025/02/03/alaskas-tuberculosis-rate-remains-elevated-preliminary-figures-show/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2025/02/03/alaskas-tuberculosis-rate-remains-elevated-preliminary-figures-show/"&gt;among the highest in the nation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says tuberculosis can be spread from person to person in close environments. Some people have latent tuberculosis in their systems for weeks, months or years. People who have been exposed to tuberculosis should be tested, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Tuberculosis is a special threat in jails and prisons due to the cramped quarters for incarcerated people, according to the CDC. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/risk-factors/correctional-facilities.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;In 2023&lt;/a&gt;, 3.6% of all tuberculosis cases in the U.S. involved inmates in a correctional facility at time of diagnosis, according to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska said in a statement Wednesday&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;that its attorneys were told by two ICE detainees during their time in Anchorage that they’d tested positive for latent tuberculosis, and that other detainees had been “informed by ICE upon their return to Tacoma on June 30th that they were exposed to tuberculosis while detained in Alaska.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;State Department of Corrections officials called the ACLU statement “categorically false and dangerously misleading.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;All of the ICE detainees who came to Alaska were “screened for tuberculosis upon admission into our care — not by ICE, but by our own qualified medical staff” as part of a standard intake procedure, corrections spokesperson Betsy Holley said in an email. One person underwent additional testing. All subsequent tests for active TB came back negative, according to Holley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Latent tuberculosis and active tuberculosis are two different things, the department’s medical chief said in an emailed response to questions. Latent tuberculosis isn’t contagious, doesn’t produce symptoms and isn’t the same thing as active tuberculosis disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“These detainees were housed in a clean, unoccupied unit and kept separate from the general population throughout their short stay — only 23 days in total," Holley wrote. “TB is not transmitted like the cold or flu. It requires prolonged, close contact — typically months — not mere days." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Peruvian ICE detainee remained hospitalized as of Wednesday evening, according to his attorney. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Anchorage Daily News</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 01:28:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi3wFBVV95cUxNRDVjeFF6Mk02R3FseDdYVGdQNk5DZzVCeW9VQjhheG5ocVEwN1BVUF9fTUhibXFGSXNKSHdsNHBXd2s2OS1vS0VtcUFlRUcySk91c2tyWWpGYlFCckJoYTcxVVhIc1ZSamkzQXptMUp0aE5Vdjk2UXFfZ3NkYWl4dnVSNlhkMHVoTnR0aHNjUDVxOEJiYjR4WE9yUURGcGV1eGpRTWJPQ2dTM2lveFNGcDZRa0JQTW1iQjJyOHcwNVR0NmlSTmZWMWJKaFpEUXh3aVBTMVZfbXQ2MjRfTHUw</guid></item><item><title>自疫情以来，加利福尼亚州的预期寿命仍未反弹-《洛杉矶时报》 | Life expectancy in California still hasn’t rebounded since the pandemic - Los Angeles Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxOS1JRWHBnYnVpck9ZVTJFNXNjTW9xODdKcnIzN0pXME04LUhZbUZhVllLdVEyeHNoX1NWQW13b24zZ0pUeWlVN2ZfSTJqR29ULTlpNXVCUEw2bEFzS2MwYXpSMkdKNW5HN3BONlM1OV8zVFN1UlpyWFFPamkwUWF6Yw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-cmsFontBrandText font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 [&amp;amp;_&amp;gt;p]:text-cms-story-body-color-text clearfix max-w-170 mt-7.5 mb-10 mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the virus caused life expectancy in California to drop significantly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s now been over two years since officials declared the pandemic-related public health emergency to be over. And yet, life expectancy for Californians has not fully recovered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, however, the virus has been replaced by drug overdoses and cardiovascular disease as the main causes driving down average lifespans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in the medical journal JAMA by researchers from UCLA, Northwestern, Princeton and Virginia Commonwealth University finds that  the average life expectancy for Californians in 2024 was nearly a year less than in 2019. The shortfall of 0.86 year signals that only about two-thirds of the state’s pandemic-era losses of 2.92 years have been reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mortality data from the California Comprehensive Death Files and population estimates from the American Community Survey, the researchers calculated annual life expectancy from 2019 to 2024, breaking the figures down by race, ethnicity, income and cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the COVID-19 virus was the primary factor in life expectancy declines during the pandemic’s peak, accounting for 61.6% of the life expectancy gap, its impact has significantly lessened. In 2024, COVID-19 accounted for only 12.8% of the life expectancy gap compared with 2019, while drug overdoses and cardiovascular disease contributed more — 19.8% and 16.3%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Black and Hispanic Californians, recovery has been even slower. Life expectancy for Black residents in 2024 remained 1.48 years below 2019 levels, while for Hispanic residents it was 1.44 years lower. In contrast, the gap for white residents was 0.63 year, and for Asian residents, who have the highest life expectancy in the state at 85.51 years, it was 1.06 years. Overall, the life expectancy for Black Californians in 2024 was under 73.5 years, more than a dozen years lower than that of Asian Californians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janet Currie, a co-author of the study and professor at Princeton University, noted that these disparities are especially striking. “You saw the very big hit that Hispanic people and Black people took during the pandemic,” she said, “but you also see that Black people in particular are still not caught up.” She added that although Hispanic populations saw a faster rebound, they too remain behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Income-based disparities in life expectancy persist in stark form. Californians living in the lowest-income census tracts (the bottom quartile) experienced a 0.99-year gap in 2024 compared with 2019, while those in the highest-income quartile had a slightly smaller 0.85-year gap. However, the overall life expectancy difference between these groups, 5.77 years, was nearly identical to the prepandemic gap of 5.63 years, suggesting that income-based health disparities persist even as pandemic impacts recede.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study highlights drug overdoses as a primary post-pandemic-emergency driver of reduced life expectancy. Black Californians and residents of low-income areas were especially affected. In 2023, drug overdoses contributed nearly a full year (0.99 year) to the life expectancy deficit for Black Californians and over half a year (0.52) for residents of low-income areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, there are signs that state and national efforts to address the overdose crisis may be yielding early results. The number for Black Californians declined to 0.55 year in 2024 while it declined to 0.26 year for residents in low-income areas; in the same time frame, the statewide number dropped from 0.4 year to 0.17 year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currie attributed the initial surge in overdose deaths in part to the pandemic itself; there were disruptions in access to treatment, and many Californians suffered greater isolation. While she welcomed the recent progress, she cautioned that the share of deaths attributable to overdoses remains high and emphasized that this was “one of the real bad consequences of the pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, cardiovascular disease is now the leading contributor to life expectancy loss among high-income Californians. In 2024, it accounted for 0.22 year of the gap for the wealthiest quartile, more than COVID-19 did at 0.10 year. The authors note this is consistent with statewide rising rates of obesity, which may be playing a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyler Evans, chief medical officer and chief exeuctive of Wellness Equity Alliance as well as the author of the book “&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/53697/pandemics-poverty-and-politics?srsltid=AfmBOoooU1gGdWAFwk_WkimSU9rwqT435AXLpbfyOkq9WmhMCKb1GW3E" target="_blank"&gt;Pandemics, Poverty, and Politics: Decoding the Social and Political Drivers of Pandemics from Plague to COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;,” emphasized how the pandemic exacerbated long-standing health inequities. “These chronic health inequities were further amplified as the result of the pandemic,” he said. While investments in social determinants of health initially helped mitigate some of the worst outcomes, he added, “the funding dried up,” making recovery harder for communities already at greater risk of poor outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evans also pointed to a broader pattern of overlapping health crises that he described as a “syndemic,” a convergence of epidemics such as addiction, chronic disease and poor access to care that interact to worsen outcomes for historically marginalized populations. “Until we invest in that sort of foundation long term, the numbers will continue to decline,” he said. “California should be a leader in health improvement outcomes in the country, not a state that continues to have our survival decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the findings are limited to California and based on preliminary 2024 data, the study provides an early glimpse into post-pandemic mortality trends ahead of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s national life expectancy dataset, expected to be published later this year. California, home to one-eighth of the U.S. population, provides valuable insight into how racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities continue to shape public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the study highlights how although the most visible impacts of COVID-19 may have faded, their ripple effects, compounded by ongoing structural inequities, continue to shape life and death in California. The pandemic may have accelerated long-standing public health challenges, and  the recovery, the study makes clear, has been uneven and incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currie warned that further cuts to Medicaid and public hospitals could make these gaps even worse. “We know what to do.

Are certain nightmares worse than others? And what – if anything – can you do to stop them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Blowing a fuse while you sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At a basic physiological level, all mammals, from whales to guinea pigs, experience something akin to dreaming – and are therefore susceptible to nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In humans, explains Dr Justin Havens, a psychological trauma therapist and leading nightmare expert, dreaming serves as overnight therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We dream for a purpose – it's an evolutionary survival mechanism. We're trying to digest the emotional experiences of the day,' he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Nightmares occur when this process doesn't work or is interrupted mid-cycle; like a fuse blowing while you sleep.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Guy Leschziner, professor of neurology and sleep medicine at King's College London, says nightmares evolve from dreams whose subject matter is distressing or traumatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We think that one of the functions of dreaming may be to consolidate memories, but to gradually cause strong emotions linked with these memories to fade,' he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, if the emotional content of those dreams or nightmares is very high, you will wake up and this process cannot be completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It means that these emotional memories are never properly dealt with and those strong emotions persist.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if you think you don't dream, you're wrong. You simply don't remember it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Everyone dreams, for roughly two hours every night, mostly during a deeper stage of sleep called REM ('rapid eye movement') – a period of increased brain activity characterised by quick, darting eye movements beneath closed eyelids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last hour of sleep is nearly all REM sleep, so any nightmares you're having when your alarm goes off are likely to linger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The term 'nightmare' originates from Old English, with 'mare' being a female demon who was thought to sit on the chest and torment sleepers with terrifying dreams and feelings of suffocation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Excess cortisol equals faster ageing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists are still unsure which parts of the brain serve as the projection booth for nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But key to what's happening are thought to be the amygdala, found near the brain stem, as well as the prefrontal cortex, located behind the forehead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The amygdala is, functionally speaking, where your 'demons' are kept; it controls emotions such as aggression, fear, anger and sadness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When you're awake, the prefrontal cortex stops these feelings from becoming too dominant. But during sleep, it shuts down – meaning the monsters lurking inside your mind come out to play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mentally, explains Tom Stoneham, a professor of philosophy at the University of York, the impact of a nightmare can leave your body 'in a high state of emotion'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In the immediate aftermath, it is the emotional effects of the nightmare and not the specific content that grips us,' he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Abidemi Otaiku, of Imperial College London, has labelled the significant effects of nightmares 'a public health concern'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nightmares can trigger feelings of anxiety, depression and general unease – which sometimes last hours or even days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2020 study in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology found that participants' moods were notably lower the day after they had a nightmare, compared with days following neutral dreams. There can be profound physical effects, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Nightmares lead to prolonged elevations of cortisol, a stress hormone closely linked to faster cellular ageing,' explains Dr Otaiku, author of the Imperial study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 study in the journal Psychophysiology found that bad dreams are accompanied by increased activation of the autonomic nervous system (which regulates functions including heart rate, blood pressure, digestion and sexual arousal).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The after-effects of this – increased body temperature, shallow, rapid breathing and muscle tension – can last long after you wake up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;The gender gap affecting our sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to a 2014 study, women report having more nightmares than men; they're also able to recall them with greater clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Female sleepers dream about different things, according to a 2014 paper published in the journal Sleep, with nightmares revolving around interpersonal conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Men, by contrast, are more likely to dream about disasters, earthquakes or wars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe the female tendency towards nightmares is related to changes in body temperature and increased hormonal levels during the menstrual cycle, as well as higher average stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Children are more likely to experience nightmares, too, especially between the ages of three and six.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We think that some of this may be evolutionary,' says Deirdre Barrett, a dream researcher at Harvard Medical School and editor of Trauma and Dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Children are smaller and are vulnerable to many more threats than adults. Nightmares may partially reflect this vulnerability.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But sleep expert Dr Nerina Ramlakhan says childhood nightmares aren't always cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If they are frequent, they can affect energy levels, ability to concentrate and learn, and increase daytime anxiety,' she explains. 'However, they are also normal and can be related to processing emotions, new experiences and creativity.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Why first-borns have more nightmares&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists think the seeds of future nightmares may be planted early in life, before the age of three-and-a-half – a time from which we usually remember very little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If this period is disrupted by a traumatic event, causing fear or stress, our brains develop coping mechanisms – far earlier than normally required – which can upset the delicate balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This traumatic event doesn't have to be anything out of the ordinary: it can be as simple as the birth of a sibling, causing the elder child to feel forgotten or unloved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2017 paper reported that first-born children had frightening dreams more than twice as frequently as later-born siblings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other causal factors include stress – whether at home or from a busy job – grief, and post-traumatic stress disorder, common in military veterans and victims of violent crimes, among whom the incidence of nightmares rises to between 71 and 96 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Most people will admit to having had a nightmare about falling from a great height; sitting an exam unprepared; being late for something important; being chased; or being unexpectedly naked at work, school or on stage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bryony Sheaves, a research clinical psychologist at the University of Oxford, has connected nightmares to three temperamental traits: paranoia; frequent 'de-personalisation' (a feeling of detachment from yourself or your surroundings); and hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But these don't refer to medical conditions. People vulnerable to nightmares may simply be more suspicious of others, feel stressed in social situations or have vivid, dreamlike imaginations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In reality, there is not one single cause,' says Dr Sheaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;The scary dreams that prepare us for real-life horrors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stemming from our subconscious, nightmares are very personal – but some bad dreams are, statistically speaking, more common and more likely to recur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most searched-for online is the nightmare in which your teeth fall out, said to reflect a life change, recent loss or stressful event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Second most-frequent are dreams about snakes, reportedly triggered by a personal transformation, such as a new job or house move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And third most common are dreams about pregnancy, which are connected to big developments, especially something exciting or unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, of course, there are the dreams we've all had at least once: falling from a great height; sitting an exam unprepared; being late for something important; being chased; or finding yourself unexpectedly naked at work, school or on stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Justin Havens says none of these should be cause for concern – it's the really traumatic, aggressive nightmares that are more likely to do damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Particularly bad ones, he says, involve 'either dying or being tortured, or nightmares of traumatic events that have already happened'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prof Stoneham, however, says nightmares affect us all in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A dream of spiders would have very different effects on an arachnophobe, an entomologist and someone who lived in a culture where spiders were eaten or had some other similarly positive role,' he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Indeed, when 'scary' subjects appear in our nightmares, this can sometimes be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 study at the University of Geneva found that bad dreams may help prepare us for frightening real-life situations by activating parts of the brain – the insula and the cingulate cortex – which are responsible for the 'fight or flight' response to danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Could you be suffering from a nightmare disorder?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If nightmares are occurring regularly, then they might be classified as a nightmare disorder,' explains Dr Ramlakhan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is a pattern of repeated frightening and vivid dreams that cause significant emotional distress and impair functioning.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;We are, however, notoriously bad at doing anything about our bad dreams – particularly in the cold light of day. 'No one goes to their GP saying: "Help, I'm having nightmares",' says Dr Havens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So when should you worry? 'Nightmare disorder ranges in severity based on the frequency of nightmares,' explains Dr Ramlakhan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Mild is less than one nightmare per week. Moderate is one or more nightmares per week, but less than nightly. Severe is nightmares every night.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also vary in duration, with chronic nightmare disorder lasting six months or longer.

During nightmares, this elevates even more as the nervous system makes you sweat, increasing your breathing and raising your heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the evidence suggests we spend less time in REM sleep when we're hot (or feverish) already because our brain tries to cool our bodies down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although there's no reliable evidence to suggest the body can predict a nightmare before it begins, some say they can envisage it before they fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Some people might feel a sense of unease, tingling or heightened awareness, but these sensations can also be associated with other sleep phenomena such as hypnagogic [pre-sleep] hallucinations or sleep paralysis,' explains Dr Ramlakhan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are other ways of predicting nightmares – including looking at your family history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Nightmares and vivid dreams can have a hereditary component,' says Dr Ramlakhan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Studies indicate that genetics contribute to the frequency and intensity of nightmares.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Indeed, a 2019 research paper by academics at the University of Helsinki found that, in studies of twins, between 36 and 51 per cent were perfectly in-sync when it came to nightmare frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Want to banish bad dreams? Try the 'clock trick'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The good news is that nightmares can be prevented and treated,' explains Dr Otaiku.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Simple measures including avoiding scary movies, maintaining good sleep hygiene, managing stress and seeking treatment for anxiety or depression may be effective.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other experts recommend avoiding alcohol three hours before sleep and caffeine eight hours before sleep, trying yoga or meditation, and ensuring your room is cool, calm and dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For more severe cases, Dr Havens has devised a method called the 'Dream Completion Technique' (&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://stopnightmares.org/"&gt;stopnightmares.org&lt;/a&gt;) – which takes two minutes to do and can cure nightmares in just one night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This self-help technique, his version of the more widely known imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT), involves regaining control over your dreams by imagining a new ending – 'completing' the nightmare – and cementing this in your mind before sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Your imagined solution doesn't need to be moral or peaceful or something that could happen in reality,' he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It can violate the laws of physics, be surreal or feature fictional characters. It can be violent, it can be pure fantasy, or even a little bit silly.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Psychotherapist Dr Stephanie Sarkis uses the 'clock trick', which involves looking for a clock face to snap yourself out of a bad dream. Your brain isn't usually capable of producing a correct one while in a sleep state: the numbers are usually jumbled up or the arms crooked. Seek this out during a bad dream, she recommends, to remind yourself you're still asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You can teach yourself to do this while awake. If your mind is lucid enough to remember your dreams, there's no reason you can't also do this while asleep. Just by reading this sentence, says Dr Sarkis, you've already planted the idea in your unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it's not all about managing your mind. 'Bodily comfort matters, too,' says Prof Stoneham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Personally, I find that a single painkiller – half a dose – can help by reducing the sensation of stiffness in my joints at night, resulting in a less-disturbed sleep.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Aspergillus spores are inhaled all the time, usually without causing any problems. But in people who are immunocompromised or who have underlying lung conditions, Aspergillus can be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0efd9c" class="body-graf"&gt;The fungus is one of the World Health Organization’s top concerns on its &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/363682/9789240060241-eng.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank"&gt;list of priority fungi&lt;/a&gt;, which notes that death rates for people with drug-resistant Aspergillus infections range from 47%-88%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e25c63" class="body-graf"&gt;The new study found that the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fungal-infections-developing-drug-resistance-rcna33937" target="_blank"&gt;fungus’ drug resistance is increasing&lt;/a&gt;. On top of that, patients are typically infected with multiple strains of the fungus, sometimes with different resistance genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7b7cc0" class="body-graf"&gt;“This presents treatment issues,” said the study’s co-author, Jochem Buil, a microbiologist at Radboud University Medical Centre in the Netherlands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0eb4a7" class="body-graf"&gt;Buil and his team analyzed more than 12,600 samples of Aspergillus fumigatus taken from the lungs of patients in Dutch hospitals over the last 30 years. Of them, about 2,000 harbored mutations associated with resistance to azoles, the class of antifungals used to treat the infections. Most of them had one of two well-known mutations, but 17% had variations of the mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d0573d" class="body-graf"&gt;Nearly 60 people had invasive infections — meaning the fungi spread from the lungs to other parts of the body — 13 of which were azole-resistant. In those people, nearly 86% were infected with multiple strains of the fungi, making treatment even more complicated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e09bbc" class="body-graf"&gt;“It is an increasingly complicated story and physicians may have trouble identifying whether or not they are dealing with a drug-resistant fungal infection,” said Dr. Arturo Casadevall, chair of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who wasn’t involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2fcdd8" class="body-graf"&gt;Before treating an Aspergillus fungal infection, doctors look for resistance genes that can give them clues about which drugs will work best. If someone is infected with multiple strains of the same type of fungus, this becomes much less clear-cut. Oftentimes, different strains will respond to different drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-038790" class="body-graf"&gt;“Azoles are the first line of treatment for azole-susceptible strains, but they do not work when a strain is resistant. For those, we need to use different drugs that don’t work as well and have worse side effects,” Buil said, adding that some people will require treatment with multiple antifungal drugs at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2c58a9" class="body-graf"&gt;The findings illustrate a larger trend of growing pressure on the few drugs available to treat fungal infections — there are only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/hcp/clinical-care/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;three major classes&lt;/a&gt; of antifungal drugs, including azoles, that treat invasive infections, compared with several dozen classes of antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-270b56" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/superbug-fungus-spread-two-cities-health-officials-say-n1274763" target="_blank"&gt;Resistance to such drugs is growing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fungal-infections-fda-new-drugs-olorofim-rcna136808" target="_blank"&gt;new ones are uniquely difficult to develop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6940fd" class="body-graf"&gt;Humans and fungi share about half of their DNA, meaning we’re much more closely related to fungi than we are to bacteria and viruses. Many of the proteins that are essential for fungi to survive are also essential for human cells, leaving fewer safe targets for antifungal drugs to attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0b23ae" class="body-graf"&gt;“The big problem for all of these fungal species is that we don’t have a lot of antifungals,” said Jarrod Fortwendel, a professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, who was not involved with the research. “Typically the genetic mutations that cause resistance don’t cause resistance to one of the drugs, it’s all of them, so you lose the entire class of drugs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e928bd" class="body-graf"&gt;Further complicating matters, the vast majority of azole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus stems from agriculture, which widely uses fungicides. The fungicides typically have the same molecular targets as antifungal drugs. Farmers spray them on crops, including wheat and barley in the U.S., to prevent or treat fungal disease. (The first instance of azole resistance was documented in the Netherlands, where antifungals are widely used on tulips.) Aspergillus fungi aren’t the target, but exposure to the fungicides gives them a head start developing genes that are resistant to the targets, sometimes before an antifungal drug with the same target even hits the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-38aef7" class="body-graf"&gt;This was the source of the vast majority of the drug resistance analyzed in the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cf69eb" class="body-graf"&gt;Fortwendel noted that fungal resistance is increasingly found around the world. “Basically everywhere we look for drug-resistant isotopes, we find them,” he said. “We are seeing this azole drug-resistance happening throughout the U.S. Those rates will likely climb.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-435cc2" class="body-graf"&gt;Any individual person’s risk of having an azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus is low, Casadevall said. Infections typically affect people who are immunocompromised and amount to around a few thousand cases per year in the U.S., Casadevall said. While relatively uncommon, the bigger risk is the broader trend of drug-resistant fungal infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-30e1ff" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“The organisms that cause disease are getting more resistant to drugs,” he said. “Even though it’s not like Covid, we don’t wake up to a fungal pandemic, this is a problem that is worse today than it was five, 10 or 20 years ago.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 22:30:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQMFNuY29VRnM5VUdma1drTWU1bzZSd3ZFUFJfRDVyTGZYMW5CY3h5T0dEN0plMEJfNEY2RGpZZ29mQWFyd1VrNTMzSHZibjRWYmYteTRUcGlDcnJuNkRwTHNlQXdhbzk4MjNRWlpuTklqMmQyclpMTW5YZUZaZEo5UUw2MF9ZbW1HcGh6aDV6Vjd6ZTVKUHlFS0RGRF_SAVZBVV95cUxOTGlaUm9ObXExQXQ2QURnbW9Zek55QkhkSUViLW56eDAwMDF6eE9xeUt1RUE2b0gwUFZ4MG9SN2xwRC13cklyRk1lLThLUXp2c05qdHhYZw</guid></item><item><title>根据一项新的研究- EatingWell ，如果您患有糖尿病，可以多吃令人惊讶的食物 | The Surprising Food to Eat More of If You Have Diabetes, According to a New Study - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaEFVX3lxTE9rN09XYmFzZXBHbjducXhIZS1FM0xieHBKRVk1dkdhYUc3dUp2N3NGMHdZNmZ4OGpXOVNDaHAyVWQzbVQwdjdubm5ybkIza25VUjFqQnFob3Z3ZzU4M1drUi04QzlzamxH?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A study suggests sesame may help improve blood sugar and cholesterol in people with diabetes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sesame products—like oil, seeds or tahini—could support heart health when used consistently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While promising, the evidence is lower-quality, so speak with a healthcare provider before making any major changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heart disease is a top health concern for good reason—it’s the leading cause of death worldwide. And if you’re among the 38.4 million American adults who are living with diabetes, your risk is even higher.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s because diabetes doesn’t just affect blood sugar—it also contributes to a cascade of problems that raise the chances of having a heart attack or stroke. These include high levels of LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, elevated triglycerides and chronic oxidative stress, which damages blood vessels over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Finding simple, effective ways to reduce this risk is a major priority in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/newly-diagnosed-diabetes-8584338" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diabetes care&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One promising approach researchers have been exploring is food—especially foods with bioactive compounds that go beyond basic nutrition. Sesame (yes, the same seed you’ll find on buns and bagels) has been a key ingredient in many diets for centuries and contains powerful compounds like sesamin and sesamol that act as antioxidants and support heart and metabolic health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Until now, studies on sesame’s health benefits have been relatively small and inconsistent. But a new meta-analysis published in &lt;em&gt;Diabetes &amp;amp; Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research and Reviews&lt;/em&gt; brings together the results of 13 clinical trials to take a closer look. The researchers focused on people with diabetes and evaluated how sesame products affected a wide range of cardiovascular risk factors, including blood sugar, cholesterol levels and markers of oxidative stress. Their findings suggest sesame may do more than add flavor—it could also play a meaningful role in protecting your heart.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, a study method that pools data from multiple past trials to look for patterns. They included 13 randomized controlled trials involving a total of 731 adults with diabetes. Most participants had type 2 diabetes, and the studies were conducted across several countries, including Iran, India, Brazil and Pakistan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants received sesame in various forms—such as sesame oil, whole seeds or capsules—at doses ranging from 200 to 60,000 milligrams per day. The interventions lasted between six and 12 weeks. The researchers measured outcomes like blood sugar, cholesterol, antioxidant activity, body weight and inflammation markers. They used the GRADE system, a formal framework for evaluating the strength of scientific evidence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, the study found that sesame products were linked to significant improvements in several cardiovascular disease risk factors for people with diabetes. Specifically, sesame consumption:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These changes suggest that sesame may help regulate blood sugar, improve lipid profiles and protect against oxidative stress—three critical goals in managing diabetes and reducing the risk of heart disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, not all findings were positive. The researchers didn’t find significant improvements in HDL (“good”) cholesterol, insulin resistance, inflammation markers like C-reactive protein or blood pressure. In addition, the effects appeared to diminish once sesame supplementation stopped, suggesting ongoing use may be necessary.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s worth noting that the quality of evidence in this study was rated “very low” due to limitations like small sample sizes, short trial durations, inconsistent results and risk of bias in study design. That means while the findings are promising, they should be interpreted with caution. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, sesame is a safe and nutritious ingredient to include in your diet, even if these specific heart-health benefits aren’t fully confirmed. It’s &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-nutrient-for-better-heart-health-8686588" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;, fiber and antioxidants, and previous studies have linked it to lower inflammation, improved blood pressure and better cholesterol levels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re living with diabetes or concerned about heart health, adding sesame products to your diet could be a simple, budget-friendly step with potential upside. In the reviewed studies, most benefits were seen with higher doses (around 30 grams per day) and longer use (eight weeks or more), so consistency matters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Try adding sesame oil to stir-fries or salad dressings, sprinkling toasted seeds over vegetables and grains or using tahini in sauces, dips and smoothies. Crushed or blended sesame (like tahini or sesame oil) may offer more benefits than whole seeds, since grinding improves the bioavailability of beneficial compounds like sesamin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, sesame isn’t a magic bullet. It should be part of a broader strategy that includes medical treatment, physical activity and a balanced diet. And if you’re on medications for blood sugar or cholesterol, check with your healthcare provider before starting any supplement.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sesame may offer heart-protective benefits for people with diabetes, according to a new meta-analysis. It helped improve blood sugar, cholesterol and antioxidant activity—three pillars of cardiovascular health. While the overall quality of the evidence is low, these findings add to a growing body of research suggesting that sesame could be a helpful addition to diabetes care. Incorporating sesame oil, tahini or seeds into your meals may be a flavorful and health-supportive choice worth exploring.&lt;br&gt;

Developing chronic diseases early in life also heightens their chances for worse outcomes from these conditions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts said the data reflect a concerning rise in obesity among teens, but also noted that not all teens with prediabetes will progress to diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/diabetes/diabetesatlas-spotlight.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention relied on the long-running &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey&lt;/a&gt;, which asked adolescents if they’d ever been diagnosed with diabetes and analyzed results of their fasting blood glucose or hemoglobin A1c tests. Its conclusion: In 2023, an estimated 8.4 million adolescents, or 32.7% of 12- to 17-year-olds, had prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These new prediabetes data among adolescents serve as a wake-up call. Type 2 diabetes is a significant threat to the health of our nation’s young people,” Christopher Holliday, director of CDC’s Division of Diabetes Translation, said in a statement Tuesday. “The good news is it’s not too late to change course. Simple lifestyle changes — like healthy eating and staying active — can make a big difference in preventing or delaying type 2 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Statistical changes in how the information was gathered and studied make comparisons difficult, but when the methods used this time were applied to the previous estimate from NHANES, the prevalence of prediabetes for 2015 through 2016 in the same age group would have been 28%, the report says. Previous estimates have been closer to 20%. The new report is based on data from two time periods: 2017 through March 2020, and August 2021 through August 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trend toward greater prevalence of prediabetes among young people is backed up by &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31790544/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;evidence from the National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;, among other studies. The increase also aligns with trends in new diabetes diagnoses among adults age 18 and older. After declining for more than 10 years, adult rates have begun to climb again, adding up to about 1.5 million new diabetes diagnoses in 2023, the CDC also said, citing the most recent data.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Not every child with prediabetes, as confirmed by blood tests, will go on to develop type 2 diabetes, Meg Bensignor, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of Minnesota’s Center for Pediatric Obesity Medicine, told STAT. She was not involved in the NHANES study. But the higher a BMI or A1C when diagnosed, the more weight gained, and the more adverse social drivers of health a child has, the higher the risk of developing type 2.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you have prediabetes, that already tells you that your pancreas and your beta cells specifically are under a lot of stress, and certainly we know that kids with type 2 diabetes lose beta cell function much more quickly than adults,” Bensignore said. “I pretty much treat everyone as if they’re going to develop type 2 because we don’t know, and getting type 2 in kids can be really devastating with a lot of comorbidities early in their life.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nancy Crimmins, a pediatric endocrinologist at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center who started a prediabetes clinic at the hospital, emphasized the lack of clarity around who will and who won’t move from prediabetes in adolescence to type 2 diabetes. She was not involved in the NHANES study, but pointed out that previous NHANES reports estimated that about 70% of youth with prediabetes go back to normal glycemic measures after puberty. Other studies show a wide range of progression, saying anywhere from 45% to 75% revert back to normal from prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you look at the sheer numbers who have prediabetes, especially in adolescence, versus how many adolescents have type 2, that number drops off a lot,” she told STAT. “One of the huge questions in our field is, can we identify who those kids are who are going to progress to type 2 and who aren’t?” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One explanation: Puberty plays a role in prediabetes, Crimmins said. Growth hormone and other hormonal changes make teens more insulin resistant during puberty.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Crimmins still called type 2 diabetes in children a very aggressive disease and an important one to prevent. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bensignor noted that the CDC report does not distinguish among precursors for type 1, type 2, or genetically related diabetes — something needed to be defined before planning a prevention strategy. Some genetic mutations that lead to diabetes are inherited, and type 1 and type 2 have different causes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the much more common type 2 diabetes, beta cells in the pancreas lose the ability to make enough insulin, or the insulin they makes doesn’t work properly. In type 1, affecting about 10% of people with diabetes, the immune system mistakenly destroys insulin-producing pancreatic islet cells, meaning they can’t make insulin to process glucose into energy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Distinguishing which type a child has is important in type 1, where not recognizing low insulin is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Certain factors prompt testing a child for prediabetes. The American Diabetes Association recommends screening children age 10 and older who have a BMI higher than the 85th percentile for their age, plus one other factor. That includes whether their mother had gestational diabetes or there’s a family history of type 2 diabetes. Beyond these risk factors are the social drivers of health, including limited access to healthy food and opportunities to be physically active. Because these social determinants are closely linked to race and ethnicity, screening automatically includes nonwhite children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Physical examinations can also be key. Darkening and thickening of the skin, skin folds, or skin tags may be signs of a body pumping out high and unhealthy amounts of insulin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What we need to be doing is really treating it seriously in all the kids, at the same time not scaring the families that we do see this during a pubertal window,” Crimmins said. “It doesn’t mean that your child will develop type 2 diabetes in the childhood period.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The field is catching up to a phenomenon that’s been developing only in the last 20 to 30 years, Bensignor and Crimmins said. A new NIH-funded effort, called the &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06525259?cond=diabetes&amp;amp;term=DISCOVERY&amp;amp;rank=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;DISCOVERY trial&lt;/a&gt;, seeks to define who among children with prediabetes will develop type 2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This data, along with others, just really cements that there needs to be scientific funding of more research to really understand how to best treat kids,” Bensignor said. “We just need more research to really understand how to prevent and then also how to effectively treat kids that do develop type 2 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;

But not all wheat is the same – and the way in which it’s grown, processed, and baked affects the nutrients that are present in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, the wheat industry has mostly focused on boosting yields, reducing inputs like fertilizers and pesticides, and ensuring good baking quality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What often gets overlooked, however, is that wheat can also be a valuable source of nutrients. In fact, it contributes over 20% to the global supply of fiber, minerals, and trace elements, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (&lt;a href="https://www.fao.org/home/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FAO&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But getting more nutrition out of wheat isn’t just about planting a different variety. It involves the entire chain – all the way from the field to the oven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-bread-nutrition-the-basics"&gt;Understanding bread nutrition – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bread can be surprisingly diverse when it comes to nutrition. A slice of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5310957/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;whole grain bread&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, can pack a good amount of fiber, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/vitamin-b-paradox-supplement-linked-to-heart-disease-risk/"&gt;B vitamins&lt;/a&gt;, iron, magnesium, and complex carbs. These nutrients help regulate blood sugar, support digestion, and provide long-lasting energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, white bread – made from refined flour – loses much of that fiber and many &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/micronutrient-deficiency-rates-are-soaring-worldwide/"&gt;micronutrients&lt;/a&gt; during processing. Manufacturers often enrich it to add some of those nutrients back, but it still doesn’t match the nutritional punch of whole grain varieties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kind of bread you eat matters, but so does how much. Bread is a carb-heavy food, and while carbs aren’t the enemy, overdoing them – especially if the bread is low in fiber – can spike your blood sugar and leave you hungrier sooner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re aiming for a more nutritious option, look for loaves with at least 3 grams of fiber and minimal added sugar. Bonus points for sprouted grains, seeds, or sourdough, which can improve digestion and nutrient absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-characteristics-of-wheat-varieties"&gt;Characteristics of wheat varieties &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the &lt;a href="https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Hohenheim&lt;/a&gt; and the University Medical Center at the &lt;a href="https://www.uni-mainz.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Mainz&lt;/a&gt; teamed up with four wheat breeding companies to study how wheat’s nutritional value can be improved across the whole value chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over five years, they recorded more than 6,000 traits across 282 wheat varieties and 400 breeding lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Friedrich Longin is director of the Wheat Department at the &lt;a href="https://lsa.uni-hohenheim.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;State Plant Breeding Institute&lt;/a&gt; and coordinator of the &lt;a href="https://lsa.uni-hohenheim.de/en/betterwheat_en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Betterwheat project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The unique thing about the project was the holistic view of variety characteristics along the entire value chain,” explained Dr. Longin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition to important characteristics for successful cultivation, several dozen processing characteristics for bakeries were considered, as well as important ingredients and proteins that could be important for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/proper-nutrition-in-the-first-1000-days-of-life-is-crucial/"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; nutrition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-some-wheat-just-has-more-nutrients"&gt;Some wheat just has more nutrients&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wheat varieties were tested in different environments across Europe to measure how both breeding and growing conditions influence the traits of the wheat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This allows us to estimate the extent of the influence of breeding, but also that of the growing environment, on these many traits,” noted Dr. Johannes Schacht, senior wheat breeder at &lt;a href="https://www.limagrain.com/en"&gt;Limagrain&lt;/a&gt; GmbH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the team’s main goals was to understand how nutrient levels vary between wheat types. They tested about 800 wheat samples for 13 key minerals and trace elements like iron and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/calcium-zinc-are-keys-to-healthier-pregnancy/"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt; – nutrients that are important for immunity, metabolism, and cell health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were able to determine that the nutrient content in different wheat varieties varies greatly – and can fluctuate by up to 50%,” stated Dr. Longin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our trials also show that the nutrients in wheat can be combined well with the required baking qualities in terms of breeding. These correlated positively with the protein content and dough properties.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-measuring-wheat-nutrient-content"&gt;Measuring wheat nutrient content&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To apply this research practically, the scientists explored how to quickly measure nutrient content in wheat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One method, x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry, could be a game changer. It scans wheat with X-rays and, based on prior calibrations, provides fast, reliable nutrient readings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In order to use this knowledge in practice, xrf fluorescence spectrometry is a method that can be used to measure the nutrient content in wheat quickly and reliably,” explained Dr. Longin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But using this technology widely would require investment. “This is only possible if the additional work is also paid for,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there’s another catch: boosting wheat’s nutrition only makes a difference if people eat more &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/refined-grains-increase-the-risk-of-heart-disease/"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt; or at least &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/chocolate-with-less-sugar-still-tastes-great-with-a-secret-ingredient/"&gt;flours&lt;/a&gt; with high type numbers (1050 and up). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because most nutrients are in the outer layers of the grain, which are lost in refined flours like types 405, 550, and 812.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bakers-make-wheat-digestible"&gt;Bakers make wheat digestible&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if wheat is nutrient-rich, our bodies might not absorb those nutrients unless the bread is &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/freezing-bread-could-make-it-healthier/"&gt;baked&lt;/a&gt; the right way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The healthy ingredients in wheat are bound in phytic acid. However, this acid cannot be digested and is excreted along with the beneficial nutrients,” said Dr. Longin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the researchers partnered with artisan bakers to test four common baking methods. One technique stood out: combining a long dough cycle with sourdough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the phytic acid is almost completely broken down during this baking process, making the ingredients available to the body,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-better-bread-starts-with-better-choices"&gt;Better bread starts with better choices&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From field to bakery, everyone involved in wheat production can help improve the nutritional value of bread. But it starts with us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All partners in the wheat value chain can influence the nutritional content of bread,” said Dr. Longin. “However, clear priorities must be set: first of all, we consumers should eat more whole grains.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This should then be baked with a long leavening process, and only then does breeding and targeted grain trading make sense in order to further optimize the nutrient profile.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wheat offers more than just &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-almonds-can-help-you-cut-calories/"&gt;calories&lt;/a&gt;. With the right science, baking methods, and consumer choices, it can play a much bigger role in a healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 21:56:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQZUVMeGhwaDJVa1dGdkpXckNGZEgwYzZ6bWVPbVlzVjlDVFdkNnluZWlwbXExMmU1WjVmLTJvMkdvTTVLMGdkdWoteHp2RlpjYmozaGpDSmdNQUFLN1oyUks1Q1ppSlhCM3RyMWYxOEZtYUNOQ3VzV0dkTUVSd2U4aWVxYnpITEZ0Ump3UE9PakI</guid></item><item><title>裸盖菇素有望成为抗衰老疗法-神经科学新闻 | Psilocybin Shows Promise as Anti-Aging Therapy - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE1UWExBSHlWN2cwcWszZGtrNXA1ZG4xOEpHTHoxY3VJeFVBa096ZVpyVmlqWHFuSjBDVTdwWXJaSlVoalhQcUxWN0xMTVhnMFpoTExpVUJSenI0aTBPeVY1c1ZBbjJ4RWhJQXk4YjVoQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Psilocybin, the active compound derived from psychedelic mushrooms, significantly delayed cellular aging and extended lifespan in a preclinical study. Researchers observed a 50% increase in the lifespan of human skin and lung cells and a 30% increase in survival in aged mice treated with psilocybin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compound appeared to reduce oxidative stress, preserve telomeres, and improve DNA repair, all key to slowing aging. These findings suggest psilocybin may one day enhance not just lifespan but also quality of life in aging populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cellular Longevity:&lt;/strong&gt; Psilocybin extended the lifespan of human cells by over 50%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Aging in Mice:&lt;/strong&gt; Treated aged mice lived 30% longer with healthier physical traits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanisms Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Benefits linked to reduced stress, DNA repair, and telomere preservation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Emory University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As revenues from the anti-aging market– riddled with hope and thousands of supplements–– surged past $500 million last year, Emory University researchers identified a compound that actively delays aging in cells and organisms. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A newly published study in &lt;em&gt;Nature Partner Journals’ Aging&lt;/em&gt; demonstrates that psilocin, a byproduct of consuming psilocybin, the active ingredient in psychedelic mushrooms, extended the cellular lifespan of human skin and lung cells by more than 50%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, researchers also conducted the first long-term &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; study evaluating the systemic effects of psilocybin in aged mice of 19 months, or the equivalent of 60–65 human years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results indicated that the mice that received an initial low dose of psilocybin of 5 mg, followed by a monthly high dose of 15 mg for 10 months, had a 30% increase in survival compared to mice that did not receive any. These mice also displayed healthier physical features, such as improved fur quality, fewer white hairs and hair regrowth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While traditionally researched for its mental health benefits, this study suggests that psilocybin impacts multiple hallmarks of aging by reducing oxidative stress, improving DNA repair responses, and preserving telomere length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telomeres are the structured ends of a chromosome, protecting it from damage that could lead to the formation of age-related diseases, such as cancer, neurodegeneration, or cardiovascular disease. These foundational processes influence human aging and the onset of these chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study concludes that psilocybin may have the potential to revolutionize anti-aging therapies and could be an impactful intervention in an aging population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most cells in the body express serotonin receptors, and this study opens a new frontier for how psilocybin could influence systemic aging processes, particularly when administered later in life,” says Louise Hecker, PhD, senior author on the study, and former associate professor at Emory University, where the research was initiated and funded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While much of what researchers know about psilocybin relates to the brain, few studies have examined its systemic impacts. Many people associate psilocybin with the hallucinogenic impacts, but the majority of the cells in the body express serotonin receptors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study opens new questions about what long-term treatments can do. Additionally, even when the intervention is initiated late in life in mice, it still leads to improved survival,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;which is clinically relevant in healthy aging,” adds Hecker, currently an associate professor at Baylor College of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This news comes on the heels of KFF’s recent report that U.S. life expectancy is still below that of other countries similar in income and size, with an average lifespan of 78.4 years, compared to 82.5 years elsewhere. Not only was it the lowest, but as the lifespan in similar countries increased by 7.9 years from 1980-2022, whereas the U.S. life expectancy has only increased by 4.7 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study provides strong preclinical evidence that psilocybin may contribute to healthier aging– not just a longer lifespan, but a better quality of life in later years,” says Director of Psychedelic Research at Emory University’s Department of Psychiatry Ali John Zarrabi, MD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a palliative care physician-scientist, one of my biggest concerns is prolonging life at the cost of dignity and function. But these mice weren’t just surviving longer—they experienced better aging,” adds Zarrabi, co-investigator of the study.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zarrabi emphasized the importance of further research in older adults, as well as the well-documented overlap between physical and mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Emory is actively involved in Phase II and III clinical trials of psilocybin-assisted therapy for depression, and these results suggest we also need to understand psilocybin’s systemic effects in aging populations,” says Zarrabi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My hope is also that if psilocybin-assisted therapy is approved as an intervention for depression by the FDA in 2027, then having a better quality of life would also translate into a longer, healthier life.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was initiated at Emory University and funded by several awards, including the Imagine, Innovative, and Impact (I3) Award, Emory University School of Medicine; the Georgia CTSA NIH Award; and a grant from Emory’s Woodruff Health Sciences Center for Health in Aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and longevity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#107c7162713e673e7d7f7f627550757d7f62693e757465" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lara Moore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://emory.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emory University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lara Moore – Emory University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41514-025-00244-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Psilocybin treatment extends cellular lifespan and improves survival of aged mice”&lt;/a&gt;

But is individual protection enough when contagious illnesses start multiplying? How will falling vaccination rates result in the return of previously eliminated diseases? Will only children be affected, or could adults see an impact as well? Who would be at highest risk if there is lower population-wide immunity? And what can be done to prevent this possibility?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To get some answers, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: Can falling vaccination rates result in the return of diseases that have been eliminated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes. There are numerous examples around the world. Countries that were once polio-free have had polio outbreaks due to interruptions in childhood immunization programs caused by war and conflict. Measles outbreaks have occurred in countries where measles had been eliminated, due to falling vaccine coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This, in fact, is what we are seeing now in the US. In Texas, 753 measles cases have been confirmed since January. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, 98 of these patients have been hospitalized, and two people, both children, have died. This outbreak is believed to have originated in communities with low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What could happen if childhood vaccination rates declined further? &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2833361" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A recent study published in JAMA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;A recent study published in JAMA&lt;/a&gt; predicted that a 10% decline in measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine coverage could result in more than 11 million measles infections over 25 years. A 50% decline in routine childhood vaccinations could result in 51 million measles cases, 9.9 million rubella cases and 4.3 million polio cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The projections also included the number of people affected by severe consequences of these diseases: As many as 10.3 million people in the US could be hospitalized, 159,200 could die, 5,400 could experience paralysis from polio, and 51,200 could have neurological consequences from measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: Is that only unvaccinated people? If someone is vaccinated, do they need to worry if others are unvaccinated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;They should still worry for three main reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;First, while many vaccinations provide excellent protection against disease, there is still a chance of breakthrough infections — meaning that the vaccine doesn’t provide 100% protection. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% protective;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% protective&lt;/a&gt; against measles infection, which is an outstanding level of protection. But it’s not 100%, so if someone is exposed to measles, there is still a chance they could become infected. However, vaccination substantially reduces the likelihood of infection and also of &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmeasles%2Fabout%2Fquestions.html&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7Cd7be32ef99dc41594ac808ddbef033a2%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638876661064504563%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=pjWyYM%2Bt5XRHeYWkmlO9CQIy8ZQ8Z7fIa0darEmyCi8%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:having severe disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;having severe disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if they were to become infected. The more disease there is in the community, the higher the likelihood of exposure and infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Second, there may be some waning of vaccine effectiveness over time. For instance, according to the CDC, immunity to pertussis — also known as whooping cough — starts to wane after a few years following vaccination. Older adults who received childhood vaccinations many years ago may become susceptible if previously controlled childhood diseases make a comeback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Third, there are people who are unable to receive the benefit of vaccination directly themselves. Some people are unable to receive certain vaccines because of specific medical conditions. For instance, someone who has a weakened immune system may not be able to get the MMR vaccine because it contains a live, weakened form of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Also, some people may have medical conditions that render vaccines less effective at protecting them. These individuals depend on the rest of society — those who can receive the vaccine — to do so and try to prevent these diseases from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What about pregnant people? Are there also some vaccines they cannot get?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; This is another good point. Take rubella, or German measles. Pregnant individuals cannot receive the MMR vaccine because it contains live virus. But rubella can be especially dangerous during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In addition to increasing the risk of miscarriage and stillbirth, rubella can lead to a condition called congenital rubella syndrome that can cause numerous birth defects including heart problems, brain damage, deafness, and lung, liver, eye and thyroid ailments. According to the World Health Organization, before the introduction of the vaccine, as many as 4 babies in every 1,000 live births were born with this condition. Rubella remains the leading cause of vaccine-preventable birth defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pregnant patients should not receive other live-attenuated vaccines either. Varicella, the vaccine against chickenpox, is another one of these vaccines. People should receive the vaccines before they are pregnant, ideally as part of their routine childhood immunizations. And other people can help to reduce disease in the community by getting vaccinated themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: Who would be at highest risk if there is lower population-wide immunity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; There are three groups I would be the most worried about. First are newborns who are too young to be vaccinated. They are also among the most medically fragile; something that is a mild cold for an older child or healthy adult could send them to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Second are immunocompromised people. This is a large group and includes patients receiving cancer treatments, transplant patients and individuals taking immunosuppressant medications. These individuals are more likely to become severely ill if exposed to disease. Vaccines may also not protect them as well, or they may be ineligible to receive certain vaccines as we discussed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Third are the elderly. As we discussed many times in reference to Covid-19, these are individuals whose age and underlying medical conditions make them more susceptible to severe illness. That, in combination with possible waning immunity from certain vaccines, could put them at higher risk if there is more disease in the community because of lower vaccine coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What can be done to prevent this possibility?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Everyone should speak with their primary care provider to verify that they are up to date on recommended vaccines. Parents with young children should do this with their family’s pediatrician, and adults should also be sure to speak with their family physician or internist as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The reason to do this is primarily to ensure that you are well-protected. If you are eligible for additional booster doses, you may consider getting them, or, if you are more susceptible to certain illnesses because you are not eligible for some vaccines, you should also know this and take precautions accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There’s another reason: The entire concept of population immunity depends on all of us doing our part to keep diseases at bay. That protects us — and others around us, including those who are especially vulnerable to severe illness and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 21:36:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPWVg0VnFqQVpOVmdzQ1VXLWtXTGIxSFFITzNwUWhTVG1sc3lzRG9JRy0yUlhZdHFGMUVROEJ1aWg1RzVRVzN1N0hucmZQLW5zN3prMWxldi0zSmpvZUljVmJWRG1JMXlqOFpVSTZnZnNZSmM2Y3l6eUdBWlJBWmFmaHJtNG14NXlO</guid></item><item><title>随着疫苗接种率的下降，可能会复发的疾病—以及您应该关注的原因- CNN | The diseases that could return as vaccination rates decline — and why you should care - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxNTFQ4VlozLS14X09nWXNWbXlWeWoxN2J2dTltSlpxU3dzM3otQ3VnOXFqajhNdTdzRDR6Rl82RkE3aDdlRmRSd3pUempCMXRvZ05zc2k4Y05MU3pOX2hfeE80NERWLTBCR09hbVo2QnI2OGFXVnY5WmNWM0w0ME9HMzdwUnc3UdIBiwFBVV95cUxNdENpUjZJNG5aOXdCMVdTVVJBeG1iWVV4N0ozSGNiR1duemtlVXZKcmNBSEVaenFQZFJfWS1LdUtXMzFZcHdJTjBnZ0prMC05Q2JpQnZjQ0FCbGxRRjBUcGRNZFlrSUZnUDRxUUoxZHZZZFE0cjBIV1gwbFE5Wk5mUEZ2RkN5OE4xTFZJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Measles have surged to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/09/health/measles-cdc-vaccine-skepticism-monarez"&gt;a record high&lt;/a&gt;, with more cases reported this year than any year since the disease was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw13m1s00003b6mzx50yd0v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This disappointing record comes amid falling childhood vaccination rates: Coverage against measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, polio and pertussis is declining in more than 30 states, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw1nure000k3b6mhn4dpkfg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some people may believe that if they’re personally vaccinated, they have nothing to worry about. But is individual protection enough when contagious illnesses start multiplying? How will falling vaccination rates result in the return of previously eliminated diseases? Will only children be affected, or could adults see an impact as well? Who would be at highest risk if there is lower population-wide immunity? And what can be done to prevent this possibility?
    &lt;/p&gt;

            To get some answers, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw1pqn9000q3b6mxc0cc51m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Can falling vaccination rates result in the return of diseases that have been eliminated?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw1rhsp000v3b6myxqjo175@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes. There are numerous examples around the world. Countries that were once polio-free have had polio outbreaks due to interruptions in childhood immunization programs caused by war and conflict. Measles outbreaks have occurred in countries where measles had been eliminated, due to falling vaccine coverage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw1rhsp000w3b6myv57h06f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This, in fact, is what we are seeing now in the US. In Texas, 753 measles cases have been confirmed since January.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, 98 of these patients have been hospitalized, and two people, both children, have died. This outbreak is believed to have originated in communities with low vaccination rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw1qxjh000t3b6mshj32e75@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What could happen if childhood vaccination rates declined further? &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2833361" target="_blank"&gt;A recent study published in JAMA&lt;/a&gt; predicted that a 10% decline in measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine coverage could result in more than 11 million measles infections over 25 years. A 50% decline in routine childhood vaccinations could result in 51 million measles cases, 9.9 million rubella cases and 4.3 million polio cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcwh87ps00023b6n6b2ziu5b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The projections also included the number of people affected by severe consequences of these diseases: As many as 10.3 million people in the US could be hospitalized, 159,200 could die, 5,400 could experience paralysis from polio, and 51,200 could have neurological consequences from measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Is that only unvaccinated people? If someone is vaccinated, do they need to worry if others are unvaccinated?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw1z7r100143b6mwyt9jujn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;They should still worry for three main reasons.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw1z7r100153b6m0np6zzme@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            First, while many vaccinations provide excellent protection against disease, there is still a chance of breakthrough infections — meaning that the vaccine doesn’t provide 100% protection. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html" target="_blank"&gt;Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% protective&lt;/a&gt; against measles infection, which is an outstanding level of protection. But it’s not 100%, so if someone is exposed to measles, there is still a chance they could become infected. However, vaccination substantially reduces the likelihood of infection and also of &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmeasles%2Fabout%2Fquestions.html&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7Cd7be32ef99dc41594ac808ddbef033a2%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638876661064504563%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=pjWyYM%2Bt5XRHeYWkmlO9CQIy8ZQ8Z7fIa0darEmyCi8%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;having severe disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if they were to become infected. The more disease there is in the community, the higher the likelihood of exposure and infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw1z4lq00123b6m75scgjmu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Second, there may be some waning of vaccine effectiveness over time. For instance, according to the CDC, immunity to pertussis — also known as whooping cough — starts to wane after a few years following vaccination. Older adults who received childhood vaccinations many years ago may become susceptible if previously controlled childhood diseases make a comeback.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw236qi00183b6mfc53530u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Third, there are people who are unable to receive the benefit of vaccination directly themselves. Some people are unable to receive certain vaccines because of specific medical conditions. For instance, someone who has a weakened immune system may not be able to get the MMR vaccine because it contains a live, weakened form of the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw2675o001b3b6mlaqi0onh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Also, some people may have medical conditions that render vaccines less effective at protecting them. These individuals depend on the rest of society — those who can receive the vaccine — to do so and try to prevent these diseases from spreading.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw27ghu001e3b6m2p4aefcn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What about pregnant people? Are there also some vaccines they cannot get?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw29mn3001j3b6ma1nbw25s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; This is another good point. Take rubella, or German measles. Pregnant individuals cannot receive the MMR vaccine because it contains live virus. But rubella can be especially dangerous during pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw29mn3001k3b6m1sfo7e02@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition to increasing the risk of miscarriage and stillbirth, rubella can lead to a condition called congenital rubella syndrome that can cause numerous birth defects including heart problems, brain damage, deafness, and lung, liver, eye and thyroid ailments. According to the World Health Organization, before the introduction of the vaccine, as many as 4 babies in every 1,000 live births were born with this condition. Rubella remains the leading cause of vaccine-preventable birth defects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw29mn3001l3b6mnoz9qdl9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pregnant patients should not receive other live-attenuated vaccines either. Varicella, the vaccine against chickenpox, is another one of these vaccines. People should receive the vaccines before they are pregnant, ideally as part of their routine childhood immunizations. And other people can help to reduce disease in the community by getting vaccinated themselves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Who would be at highest risk if there is lower population-wide immunity?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw29mn3001n3b6m3y3y8gmf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; There are three groups I would be the most worried about. First are newborns who are too young to be vaccinated. They are also among the most medically fragile; something that is a mild cold for an older child or healthy adult could send them to the hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw29mn3001o3b6mcogntunf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Second are immunocompromised people. This is a large group and includes patients receiving cancer treatments, transplant patients and individuals taking immunosuppressant medications. These individuals are more likely to become severely ill if exposed to disease. Vaccines may also not protect them as well, or they may be ineligible to receive certain vaccines as we discussed earlier.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Third are the elderly. As we discussed many times in reference to Covid-19, these are individuals whose age and underlying medical conditions make them more susceptible to severe illness. That, in combination with possible waning immunity from certain vaccines, could put them at higher risk if there is more disease in the community because of lower vaccine coverage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What can be done to prevent this possibility?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Everyone should speak with their primary care provider to verify that they are up to date on recommended vaccines. Parents with young children should do this with their family’s pediatrician, and adults should also be sure to speak with their family physician or internist as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw29mn3001s3b6m0aj5889p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The reason to do this is primarily to ensure that you are well-protected. If you are eligible for additional booster doses, you may consider getting them, or, if you are more susceptible to certain illnesses because you are not eligible for some vaccines, you should also know this and take precautions accordingly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw29mn3001t3b6m1viy7qia@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s another reason: The entire concept of population immunity depends on all of us doing our part to keep diseases at bay. That protects us — and others around us, including those who are especially vulnerable to severe illness and death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

In people with creatine deficiency disorders, supplements often fail to improve neurodevelopment because the brain’s protective barrier blocks access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are developing a novel technique to deliver creatine directly to the brain, bypassing this barrier to restore normal brain function. Early work shows promise in improving brain health in conditions that currently leave many with lifelong cognitive challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Role of Creatine:&lt;/strong&gt; Creatine is essential for energy production in brain cells and supports functions like memory, learning, and seizure control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deficiency Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; People with creatine deficiencies often improve muscle mass with supplements but continue to struggle with severe neurodevelopmental impairments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovative Delivery:&lt;/strong&gt; A targeted method is being tested to deliver creatine directly to the brain, overcoming the natural barriers that prevent supplementation from working effectively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creatine is popularly known as a muscle-building supplement, but its influence on human muscle function can be a matter of life or death.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creatine is very crucial for energy-consuming cells in skeletal muscle throughout the body, but also in the brain and in the heart,” said Chin-Yi Chen, a research scientist at Virginia Tech’s Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111507"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;It may play a role in a variety of functions, including seizure control, learning, memory, and brain development. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chen is part of a research team working to develop a technique that uses focused ultrasound to deliver creatine directly to the brain. The work, being conducted in the lab of Fralin Biomedical Research Institute Assistant Professor Cheng-Chia “Fred” Wu, will be supported by a $30,000 grant from the Association for Creatine Deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine plays a vital role in the brain, where it interacts with phosphoric acid to help create adenosine triphosphate, a molecule essential for energy production in living cells. In addition to its role in energy production, creatine also influences neurotransmitter systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, creatine influences the brain’s major inhibitory pathways that use the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid, which limits neuronal excitability in the central nervous system. It may play a role in a variety of functions, including seizure control, learning, memory, and brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research suggests that creatine may itself function as neurotransmitter, as it is delivered to neurons from glial cells in the brain and can influence signaling processes between other neurons. While creatine deficiency disorders can weaken the skeletal muscle and the heart, they can also severely affect the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many patients see increased muscle mass and body weight with creatine supplements, but they often continue to face neurodevelopmental challenges that can hinder their ability to speak, read, or write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is largely caused by the brain’s protective blood-brain barrier. This selective shield blocks harmful substances like toxins and pathogens from entering brain tissue, but it can also prevent beneficial compounds like creatine from reaching the brain when levels are low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu studies therapeutic focused ultrasound, which precisely directs sound waves to areas of the brain to which access has been opened temporarily. The process allows drugs to reach diseased tissue without harming surrounding healthy cells. While Wu is investigating this method as a potential treatment for pediatric brain cancer, he also sees potential in applying it to creatine deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Through the partnership between Virginia Tech and Children’s National Hospital, I was able to present our work in focused ultrasound at the Children’s National Research &amp;amp; Innovation Campus,” Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There, I met Dr. Seth Berger, a medical geneticist, who introduced me to creatine transporter deficiency. Together, we saw the promise that focused ultrasound had to offer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Focused Ultrasound Foundation has recognized Virginia Tech and Children’s National as Centers of Excellence. Wu said the two organizations bring together clinical specialists, trial experts, and research scientists who can design experiments that could inform future clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a moment that made me really excited — that I had found a lab where I could move from basic research to something that could help patients,” Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When Fred asked me, ‘Are you interested in this project?’ I said, ‘Yes, of course.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because creatine deficiencies can impair brain development, the early stages of Chen’s project will concentrate on using focused ultrasound to deliver creatine across the blood-brain barrier. Chen hopes the technique will restore normal brain mass in models of creatine deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c7aba6aca2ababa2be87b1b3e9a2a3b2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Leigh Anne Kelley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://vt.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Leigh Anne Kelley – Virginia Tech&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 21:09:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE9mVkxtMS1fYmZ6MWNyWUstajN6U1FBU1dnX0FCLVN4dURFMDk0ekVKNGh4YnQ2a19nYU9WajBXeHpNTGdoa3Z2M2tKVFhvXzY2UmM5ZHNCS1E0ZHI4bktseGV4VWhraVY4RzNV</guid></item><item><title>意识形态极端主义的4个心理标志-大思考 | The 4 psychological markers of ideological extremism - Big Think</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNNXJFOGRGblYxTkxIa29hVVdpTFJSYkFMVVpjLUg4dEQ2MHNxOUlsakl0Zm9IdTM0aGNLRzNiTDZVUEQwejVzbkhpZEtXa191TGs2N2ZWNm5Yd0JzTUxKdGhkNjJkTl85RGJaTmhFU1YyMjBTMVV2TENZN1RzUTdpYjJjMXZGeGhLMW90Qy1pQk80UDc3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div x-data="prose" class="mb-8 prose  with-dropcap"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology is largely the study of correlations and the extent to which we can establish connections between correlations and causation. We are often told that “correlation does not mean causation” in the world of data. A classic example: Ice cream sales have a positive correlation with crime rates. Ice cream does not cause criminality, but apparently, the summer months cause both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is no hard rule. Although correlation doesn’t &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; mean causation, it can often seriously imply or suggest it. Psychologists grapple with this all the time. For example, it’s been anecdotally obvious for millennia that people who sleep fewer hours tend to perform worse on memory, attention, and decision-making tasks, and young people with irregular bedtimes often achieve poorer grades. That’s “just” a correlation. It’s only relatively recently that we have the neuroimaging and neuroscientific apparatus to prove causality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specter of correlation/causation hovered over this week’s &lt;a href="https://miniphilosophy.substack.com/"&gt;Mini Philosophy interview&lt;/a&gt; with the prizewinning author &lt;a href="https://www.leorzmigrod.com/"&gt;Leor Zmigrod &lt;/a&gt;about her recent book, &lt;em&gt;The Ideological Brain&lt;/em&gt;. Zmigrod’s book explores extreme ideologies, and her career has been spent finding these correlations. During our interview, Zmigrod shared the findings of both her book and career to argue that there are four principal factors that correlate with someone holding extreme ideological beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, these are the factors that most often lead a person to become an extremist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cognitive-rigidity"&gt;Cognitive rigidity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cognitive rigidity is the tendency to see the world in a really binary way,” Zmigrod says. “It’s where you really struggle to adapt to change, and you tend to think along one mental track rather than switching between different modes of thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways you can test for this kind of rigidity, but Zmigrod’s favored method is to ask someone to imagine the possible uses for an item. Let’s say I showed you a Coca-Cola bottle: What could you use it for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more rigid reader will find it hard to think outside the paradigm of “it can hold liquid.” Others will see it as a candle holder, a tiny terrarium, a vase, a salt shaker, and so on. This rigidity in thought is often correlated with extreme ideologies. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6514156/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;The more rigid a person’s thoughts, the more they incline toward extremism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-emotional-volatility"&gt;Emotional volatility&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second factor is “emotional impulsivity” or volatility. These people will “tend to be the most seeking of thrills and sensations in their daily lives,” Zmigrod says. “They want that novelty and that sensation. This is the person who’s going to run to the front of the line.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t overly surprising. It makes sense that people who are extreme in their day-to-day lives might tend toward &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30382738/"&gt;extreme ideologies&lt;/a&gt;. But it also involves another set of co-appearing characteristics — what Zmigrod calls the tendency some people have “to gravitate towards violent solutions and self-sacrifice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think about your friends, who is the most likely to pick a fight? Who’s the most likely to do something impulsive and jump without looking? Well, you might want to check how ideologically extreme they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amygdala"&gt;Amygdala&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next two markers of extremism are invisible to us. Unless, that is, you happen to be reading this article on a wheely stool next to an MRI machine. In our interview, Zmigrod revealed how there are two neurobiological aspects of a person’s brain that correlate with an increased likelihood of extremism. The first centers on the amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The amygdala is responsible for the processing of negative emotions like fear, threat, and disgust,” Zmigrod says. “And that brain area is actually larger in right-wing believers than left-wing believers. And this is a finding that’s been consistent across multiple countries, hundreds of participants, that there’s this brain area that might predispose you either to a left-wing or a right-wing ideology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21474316/"&gt;We have correlates and data sets&lt;/a&gt;, evidence and observations. It’s left to us, the readers, to draw the conclusions we think are there to draw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prefrontal-cortex"&gt;Prefrontal cortex&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other neurobiological aspect of extreme ideology is related to our “more sophisticated decision-making and rationality,” which is found in the prefrontal cortex. According to a 2025 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452225003045"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Adrián-Ventura et al., published in &lt;em&gt;Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, individuals with a thinner “dorsomedial PFC cortex” tended to exhibit stronger left- and right-wing authoritarian traits, after controlling for age, sex, and total brain volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Zmigrod puts it, “the brain differs in function and structure depending on whether you believe a fundamentalist ideology or a more moderate one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we’ve already touched on, these are only correlative observations. More work, and possibly more technology, is required to fully prove causation in the way we have with sleep deprivation. But even then, an answer will likely never be black and white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-working-backward"&gt;Working backward&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belief formation is a complex area that brings neuroscientists, psychologists, and philosophers around the table to shout it out. There will never be one factor we can point to and say, “Yep, this means Timmy will be an extremist.” Nature and nurture, brain and environment, genetics and upbringing all bubble together in a complex, epistemological goulash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s interesting, though, is the corollary of these observations, especially the first two. If we know that cognitive rigidity and emotional volatility incline a person to extremism, we can reverse-engineer the problem. If we raise our children to be less emotionally volatile and help our friends to flex their cognitive worlds, we can hope to reverse a trajectory of increasing extremism. When people retreat to their silos and scream at each other in increasingly loud ideological tribes, the only outcome is bad. Perhaps we can buck the trend. We just need to think of more uses for a Coke bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caligula, the notoriously erratic Roman emperor known for his bloodthirsty cruelty, probably also possessed a nerd's knowledge of medicinal plants, according to a new Yale study.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;The study, by the Yale Ancient Pharmacology Program (YAPP), illuminates a brief anecdote about Caligula originally reported by the historian Suetonius in "The Twelve Caesars," a second-century collection of biographies of Roman rulers from Julius Caesar to Domitian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the story, an unnamed Roman senator of praetorian rank who is suffering from an unspecified ailment takes a leave of absence to the Greek spa town of Antikyra in hopes that his health will benefit from treatments made from hellebore—a &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/flowering+plant/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt; purported to have medicinal properties. The senator, perhaps pressing his luck, asks Caligula to extend his leave. In response, the emperor has the hapless senator executed, quipping that "a bloodletting was necessary for one whom hellebore had not benefited in all that time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yale scholars, combining ethnobotanical field data and a close reading of &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/ancient+texts/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;ancient texts&lt;/a&gt;, offer a new understanding of the passage, providing context about Antikyra's place in the Roman Empire and Caligula's familiarity with pharmacology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our work suggests that Antikyra functioned as a kind of Mayo Clinic of the Roman world—a place where affluent and influential Romans visited for &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/medical+treatments/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medical treatments&lt;/a&gt; not widely available elsewhere," said co-author Andrew Koh, who is YAPP's principal investigator and a research scientist at the Yale Peabody Museum. "It also provides evidence that Caligula, while a tyrant, was more knowledgeable about medicine than has been previously understood."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, &lt;a href="https://www.peasa.eu/site/article/view/56" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts&lt;/i&gt;, was also co-authored by Trevor Luke, a YAPP faculty affiliate and associate professor of classics at Florida State University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Medical tourism in the Roman world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Located on the Gulf of Corinth in the Phocis region of central Greece, Roman Antikyra was a modest port town famed for its association with unique hellebore treatments. In ancient times, hellebore was valued as a purgative, a treatment for epilepsy, and a cure for mental illness, the researchers said. Ancient texts describe two varieties of the plant: white hellebore used to treat afflictions of the head and black hellebore used to clear the bowels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examining historical uses of hellebore is difficult in part because ancient peoples, unbound by modern taxonomic classifications, used the term "hellebore" to reference various plants, the researchers said. They also note that ancient identifications of plant life evolved over time and geography, leading to discrepancies in plant names.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further complicating matters, local naturalists in modern Greece use identifications that clearly reference plants that are different than those described in ancient sources. For example, the researchers said, an herbalist in modern-day Antikyra, which today is a small fishing village, identified "elleboro" as dwarf elderberry, which is an altogether different plant than hellebore as described in ancient texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely that hellebore grew in sufficient quantities around ancient Antikyra to sustain large-scale production of herbal medicines, the researchers concluded. Today, the closest large stands of hellebore they discovered were located more than 2,500 feet above sea level on the southern slopes of Mount Helicon, located southeast of Antikyra. (The hellebore specimens they discovered clearly match depictions in ancient sources.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;While not an abundant source of the plant, Antikyra was renowned for the perceived efficacy of the special medicinal hellebore potions prepared there, which were used to treat melancholy, insanity, epilepsy, and gout. Some Antikyran hellebore potions contained another plant, identified as sesamoides in ancient texts, a special ingredient that rendered the purgatives safer to consume, the researchers said, citing an Antikyran medicinal recipe described by Pliny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the early first century BCE, Romans had learned of Antikyra's reputation as a source of especially beneficial hellebore potions through the immigration of Greek physicians to Rome and the lively trade in Greek books, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is remarkable that Antikyra is mentioned in the historical record since it was never an important cultural or economic destination," Luke said. "It was known for hellebore treatments and little else. It's an example of ancient medical tourism. Roman bigwigs traveled there for treatments the same way that the rich and powerful visit Rochester, Minnesota, to avail themselves of the latest medical techniques and therapies available at the Mayo Clinic."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke and Koh believe the spa town held personal appeal to Caligula: They posit that he likely suffered from an affliction that Antikyran potions were believed to cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers will now analyze the phytochemicals in specimens they recently collected from the Greek landscape to test their efficacy and biochemical interactions in relation to their ancient reputations, Koh said. The analytic approach, he said, combines textual evidence with &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/scientific+evidence/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;scientific evidence&lt;/a&gt; to better understand history and glean lessons from the ancient past that are applicable today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Closely collaborating with Trevor, a top historian of ancient Rome, provides a strong humanistic foundation for our science team to build its work upon," Koh said. "In turn, YAPP's scientific research offers historians a unique opportunity to understand long-studied ancient texts in fresh new ways."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;A more learned Caligula&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suetonius's account of Caligula's life differs from his biographies of other emperors in that it is split into two sections: The first describes Caligula's background and rise to power; the second is devoted to his erratic, cruel, and deranged behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not seeking to rehabilitate Caligula's reputation, the researchers show that he was probably a more learned man than one might infer from the monstrous deeds described by Suetonius. They cite the philosopher Philo of Alexandria's portrayal of Caligula as an emperor endowed with impressive stores of practical knowledge, including a strong understanding of trade routes and seamanship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philo, one of the emperor's most prominent critics, also comments on how Caligula distorted Apollo's art of medicine for malicious purposes, suggesting the emperor possessed detailed pharmacological knowledge, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also cite several stories demonstrating that Caligula, who has a reputation as an enthusiastic poisoner, indeed possessed a deep knowledge of poisons and antidotes. They note that Caligula was convinced that his father, Germanicus, had succumbed to poisoning, which would have motivated him to study pharmacology if only out of paranoia about suffering a similar fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caligula was familiar with hellebore remedies, Luke and Koh suggest, pointing out that he suffered from epilepsy, insanity, and insomnia—all ailments that ancient people believed the plant could alleviate. Suetonius's anecdote suggests that Caligula also had a sense of how long it should've taken for hellebore to heal the senator.&lt;/p&gt;

																																			&lt;p&gt;Caligula's reference to bloodletting when joking about the doomed senator suggests that he had read Celsus, whose medical treatise "De Medicina" was composed during the reign of Tiberius, Caligula's predecessor, and prescribes bloodletting as an alternative to hellebore in treating epilepsy, the researchers explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's possible that Suetonius is wrong, and that Caligula wasn't ordering the man's execution but simply prescribing an alternative treatment that he had read about or knew from his own experience," Luke said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're presenting a more complete and well-rounded version of Caligula as a ruler who was in tune with the medical wisdom of his day. He's dismissed as a madman, perhaps rightly so, but we show he very likely knew something about hellebore and pharmacology in general."&lt;/p&gt;

You'll want to [think about] what else might have changed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, experts said mucus should be clear in color — indicating everything is functioning normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But should this appearance vary or the mucus start to be produced in more copious amounts, this could indicate an underlying condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nasal mucus - simply known as snot - is deeply linked to human health and can reveal how well the immune system is functioning in a person&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mucus in the nose serves a vital function in keeping airways open by trapping dust and pathogens, helping someone to keep breathing normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also boosts the immune system, with the mucus containing antibodies that can attack pathogens, and humidify air that is breathed in, preventing airways from drying out and becoming irritated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the colors to be concerned about, doctors say that white, cream-colored or light yellow mucus suggests the body is fighting a cold or other viral infection, as the white is caused by the white blood cells fighting off infectious intruders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When mucus turns denser and becomes yellowish-green, it means the body is fighting a bacterial infection or inflammation in the sinuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While reddish or pink snot may indicate that a small blood vessel in the nose burst at some point and the blood has now dried out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Apart from this, brown colored mucus can also be sign of excessive exposure to air pollutants or heavy smoking while black mucus can indicate that the body is fighting a seriou fungal infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also say the amount of nasal mucus produced could also be a warning sign of a hidden complication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If someone's nose produced a lot of mucus, this could be an indicator of a bacterial infection or allergic reaction to pollen - which could cause excessive mucus production by the nose.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rare cases, experts say it may also be a very early warning sign of Parkinson's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One the earliest signs Parkinson's patients have of the disease is a struggling to use the muscles in their nose and throat - causing saliva and mucus to accumulate in their nasal passage, according to the Parkinson's Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analyzing a person's mucus may also offer insight into Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has also shown that the presence of excessive amyloid proteins in the nasal mucus may indicate that a person is suffering from Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alzheimer's disease is believed to be caused by the development of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain - which damage and kill cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amyloid protein molecules stick together in brain cells, forming clumps called plaques. While tau proteins twist together in fiber-like strands called tangles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The plaques and tangles block the ability of the brain's neurons to send electrical and chemical signals back and forth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jennifer Mulligan, an otolaryngologist at the University of Florida&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, this disruption causes permanent damage in the brain that leads to Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it remains unclear how and when the quantity of amyloid proteins increases in the snot of people, studies have noted that the presence of the proteins can be found in nasal mucus is a clear biomarker for Alzheimer's disease in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, scientists note that examining nasal fluid early on to detect the particular proteins can help slow down the progression of the disease by starting treatments early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, new research indicates that examining the sticky fluid may also show whether a person is at risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – an inflammatory lung disease and the sixth leading cause of death in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A July 2025 &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(25)00332-X/fulltext"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology found that long-time smokers who had high levels of a protein called IL-26 in their mucus were most likely to develop COPD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Swedish researchers found that high levels of the protein in the lungs and mucus of smokers was a clear sign of weak lung function and poor breathing capacity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

"Doing 30 minutes worth of walking for seven days can create a weekly caloric expenditure of 700 to 1,400 calories. These numbers can add up in the long run and result in weight loss for someone who is overweight and was previously sedentary," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;To figure out how much walking you need to do to lose weight, it can help to identify your resting metabolic rate (RMR), which helps you calculate &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a19982584/how-many-calories-do-i-need/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a19982584/how-many-calories-do-i-need/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="how many calories" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;how many calories&lt;/a&gt; you need to burn for a calorie deficit.

"Gaining lean muscle mass will increase your resting metabolic expenditure, which means you will be burning more calories at rest. This all leads to increased weight loss."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="16" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.0"&gt;2.

"Typically, anything that makes an exercise more challenging will lead to an increase in calories burned," he adds. If vests and backpacks aren't your thing, you can also try wrist weights or another option to boost your workout. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-embed="embed-gallery" data-lazy-id="P0-14" data-node-id="18"

Try tracking your steps with a mobile app or smartwatch. This can help you view your progress and stay focused on your movement goals. "Data tracking can help motivate individuals [toward] goals, accomplishments, and help make up for any deficits throughout the week," says Pata.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://membership.womenshealthmag.com/womens-health-premium-membership-1.html?cds_tracking_code=whlpanelnav" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-membership-link="https://membership.womenshealthmag.com/womens-health-premium-membership-1.html?cds_tracking_code=whlpanelnav" data-node-id="21.0" data-href="https://membership.womenshealthmag.com/womens-health-premium-membership-1.html?cds_tracking_code=whlpanelnav" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://membership.womenshealthmag.com/womens-health-premium-membership-1.html?cds_tracking_code=whlpanelnav" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Join Women's Health+ today for member-exclusive workout and meal plans." rel="nofollow" class="css-1befp5m e1aq0z090"&gt;Join Women's Health+ today for member-exclusive workout and meal plans.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="22" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="22.0"&gt;4. Alternate between walking and jogging. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You don't necessarily have to run to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62353915/how-to-lose-weight-after-60/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62353915/how-to-lose-weight-after-60/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="lose weight" data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt;, but to amp up your walking workouts, try jogging or running slowly for as little as 10 seconds and then walk for two minutes (and repeat). "Adding in short jogs or runs during your walk will help you increase the intensity of your workout, which can help you accelerate your weight loss," Wickham says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;To get creative (and work your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a19919232/lose-thigh-fat/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a19919232/lose-thigh-fat/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="leg muscles" data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;leg muscles&lt;/a&gt;), you can also practice walking backward, says Wickham. "Walking backward works your quadricep muscles more than walking forward, which can help you maintain healthy and strong knees." Just make sure you're in a safe environment for this (and be aware of other pedestrians). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="26" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="26.0"&gt;5. Create a fun walking playlist. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Sometimes, all it takes is the right song to pump you up. Playing uplifting tunes while you're out and about can make your walking experience more enjoyable. To fully immerse yourself, Pata suggests creating a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a27511573/best-workout-songs-playlist/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a27511573/best-workout-songs-playlist/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="workout playlist" data-node-id="27.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;workout playlist&lt;/a&gt; of your favorite songs that lasts the length of the walk. It'll fly by before you know it! &lt;br data-node-id="27.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="28" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.0"&gt;6. Don't forget your water bottle. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a39265125/how-much-water-should-i-drink-to-lose-weight/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a39265125/how-much-water-should-i-drink-to-lose-weight/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Drinking water" data-node-id="29.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Drinking water&lt;/a&gt; is an important part of weight loss, so don't forget to bring your favorite bottle along. "Staying properly hydrated is key for optimal health," says Wickham. "The healthier and more hydrated you are, the better your weight loss journey will be." Not to mention, the H2O will keep your energy up and help you log more miles.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="31" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="31.0"&gt;7. Use a food tracker. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you're already taking stock of what you eat with a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a31699213/macro-tracking-apps/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a31699213/macro-tracking-apps/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="food diary app" data-node-id="32.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;food diary app&lt;/a&gt;, it may be helpful to jot down how many calories you're burning by walking. This helps keep you aware of your actions and how it measures up against your weight loss goals, says Pata. That said, counting calories isn't the healthiest option for everyone, so be mindful of choosing a method that works best for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="33" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.0"&gt;8. Stay consistent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;To reap the full benefits of walking for weight loss, you have to commit to walking at a regular schedule, whether that's once a day or a week. "Health is a lifestyle, not a quick fix," says Wickham. "Find ways that you can add in your walks that will help stay consistent. The more often you walk, the more weight loss you will have." Pro tip: Take the stairs instead of the elevator, get off the bus or train a few stops early and walk home, or invest in an &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g42017752/best-foldable-treadmills/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g42017752/best-foldable-treadmills/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="at-home treadmill" data-node-id="34.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;at-home treadmill&lt;/a&gt; to get your steps in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="35" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="35.0"&gt;9. Purchase a good pair of shoes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Next, treat yourself to some nice sneakers that you only use for walking. "This creates a 'get-in-the-zone' attitude when you put them on and [encourages] an enjoyable walking experience," Pata says.

Schedule and map out your walks. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="39" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Penciling in your workouts will make it that much more likely that you'll follow through with your goals. "You know what they say...schedule it or you won’t do it. Choosing one time every day to perform your walks will help you stay consistent," says Wickham. "Prioritize your walks and plan around them to ensure you get them in every day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="40" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You can even plan your walking route with Google Maps so you know exactly how far you'll walk. Just be aware of your surroundings, practice safety, and share your location with someone you trust just in case—especially if you're walking solo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="41" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="41.0"&gt;11.

This will help you stay prepared and less likely to miss a walk due to less-than-ideal conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="43" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;To make sure you still exercise on bad weather days, have a rainy-day back-up plan, like keeping your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g63175315/best-gym-bags-for-women/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g63175315/best-gym-bags-for-women/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="gym bag" data-node-id="43.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;gym bag&lt;/a&gt; packed and ready to go, or heading to the nearest mall to do some laps, Pata recommends. You’ll be less likely to forget working out altogether if you have a plan B in place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="44" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="44.0"&gt;12. Invite a friend or family member on your walks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="45" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Asking someone to keep you company while you get some steps in is a great way to stay consistent with your walks &lt;em data-node-id="45.1"&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; maintain your friendships&lt;em data-node-id="45.3"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, says Wickham. You can even suggest coffee and a walk, Pata says, which will encourage you to get more movement in as opposed to sitting all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="47" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt; If you can't be in-person, schedule a catch-up call with someone while you walk. “Besides rekindling or maintaining relationships, [a phone call] will make time go by more quickly and the walks may begin to become enjoyable,” says Pata.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-weight-can-i-lose-from-walking" data-node-id="48" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;How much weight can I lose from walking?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="49" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;An individual can typically burn up to 5,600 calories a month from walking alone, which is roughly 1.6 pounds, says Pata. However, the exact number is dependent on a person’s individual calculations that take weight, level of conditioning, and training capacity into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="50" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You're more likely to lose weight if you're also in a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a35116575/what-is-calorie-deficit/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a35116575/what-is-calorie-deficit/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="calorie deficit" data-node-id="50.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;calorie deficit&lt;/a&gt;, in which you burn more calories than you consume, Wickham says. Any type of movement you engage in throughout the day can help you increase your overall calorie expenditure, he says—but since walking doesn't burn quite as many calories as, say, running or sprinting, you'll probably see more weight loss progress if you combine your walking routine with other &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a38423827/benefits-of-hiit/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a38423827/benefits-of-hiit/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="high-intensity workouts" data-node-id="50.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;high-intensity workouts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/e0ea7044-90b8-4e60-b6eb-3542c23e353f_1693418498.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Emily Shiffer" title="Headshot of Emily Shiffer" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;div class="css-1y37fga ev8dhu54"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily Shiffer has worked as a writer for over 10 years, covering everything from health and wellness to entertainment and celebrities.

Except for one: &lt;span class="il"&gt;dopamine&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="il"&gt;Dopamine&lt;/span&gt; is the one neurochemical that looks to the future. It anticipates what may be to come and drives you towards it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That can be a good thing — &lt;span class="il"&gt;dopamine&lt;/span&gt; is one powerful motivator — but it also has its downsides. Here to help us understand how the most important chemical in the brain works and how to deal with its pitfalls is Michael Long. Michael is a trained physicist turned writer whose latest book is &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/44tqkdz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taming the&lt;/em&gt;&lt;i&gt; Molecule of More&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Mike and I discuss how &lt;span class="il"&gt;dopamine&lt;/span&gt;, for better and worse, makes you want what you don’t have. He shares what causes low &lt;span class="il"&gt;dopamine&lt;/span&gt; activity, how to know if you’re experiencing it, and what increases &lt;span class="il"&gt;dopamine&lt;/span&gt;. We then talk about how to deal with the consequences of &lt;span class="il"&gt;dopamine&lt;/span&gt; in some of the scenarios in which it plays a role — like losing the spark in a relationship and getting stuck in a smartphone scroll habit — and why so much of taming &lt;span class="il"&gt;dopamine&lt;/span&gt; comes down to living in the here and now. We end our conversation with why &lt;i&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/i&gt; is really a novel about &lt;span class="il"&gt;dopamine&lt;/span&gt; and the fundamental answer to not letting the &lt;span class="il"&gt;dopamine&lt;/span&gt; chase lead you around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Resources Related to the Podcast&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Connect With Michael Long&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/44tqkdz"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-190170" src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2025/07/81OsOoUURL._SL1500_.jpg" alt='Book cover of "Taming the Molecule of More" by Michael E.
