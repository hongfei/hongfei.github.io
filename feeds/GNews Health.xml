Even if we are not directly affected by conflict, job losses or market changes hurting our retirement savings, we may know others who are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="99AJGRKHQH7PH8TFAUYYYFWN1R" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Keeping stress at bay can be challenging. And at times when many people are stressed, avoiding stress contagion — the transmission of stress from one person or group of people to others — can be difficult. Particularly because of omnipresent social media, where stressors are often amplified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7NXHR6D1711RHAGFVF92UM8JTR" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We tend to favor the negative aspects of news,” said &lt;a href="https://bio.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/natalia-duque-wilckens/"&gt;Natalia Duque-Wilckens&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of biological sciences at North Carolina State University, so that is what we &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01538-4"&gt;share with others&lt;/a&gt;. “And that’s a huge stress contagion that happens because we’re social, and we care about what’s happening to other humans as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JYJ0QXMDKX6214EG9NBDF4AJN0" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But it isn’t impossible to avoid stress contagion.

And it wasn’t just an individual bird that began acting stressed, but the whole group of birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JGK7TA1AUN53T086T8B03KY2JW" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If you imagine, in humans, if you live in a shared apartment with five friends and two of them are chronically stressed,” there will be a behavioral change in everyone, said Brandl, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Konstanz and Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WNR1EMCY9D0477XFG8ZG76NBB4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;How stress is transferred between individuals is not fully understood, Duque-Wilckens said, but it’s probably highly dependent on the species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2VVTW7AQKX7TF2CJEFBZBDTAB8" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“In rodents, stress is often communicated through smells and high-pitched vocalizations that are too high for us to hear,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="27VJMFN3ZN171F2JAXHFMZPAM0" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Humans, by comparison, are more visual. “We tend to pick up on stress through things like facial expressions, posture or tone of voice. The way stress spreads depends a lot on how each species communicates,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="ZF8FAZ6XYD4Y5FFFYKVMZ7BE70" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="ZF8FAZ6XYD4Y5FFFYKVMZ7BE70"&gt;How social interactions help&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MV32LIEQUVCXFCICGDXY6FCWBU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But on the flip side of the social contagion coin is the benefit of social buffering, Duque-Wilckens said. When a person or animal that has been exposed to a stressor has the opportunity to interact with another individual, it reduces their stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="1YPR5FM5G52T73T44JZN0YY000" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Social interaction really has a positive impact on us, because it just helps &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2921311/"&gt;downregulate the stress response&lt;/a&gt; faster,” Brandl said. Poor social connections are also associated with a &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf"&gt;host of illnesses&lt;/a&gt;, including cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NPXZFRMZYVC7LDBRAZ22SNOGPA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A stressed person may, in the short term, negatively affect the people doing the consoling, Duque-Wilckens said. “But, at the same time, this reciprocal mechanism helps to maintain the stability of the group in the long term,” she said. In the future, she said, the roles may be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="I4ZBHYJAE5HJZPE2LFRSR2RUUA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Stress is rooted in unpredictability and uncontrollability, Dimitroff said. “If you have quality social relationships in your life, you will, by definition, feel like life is more controllable and more predictable, because you know you’ll get that support when you need it,” she said. “If something bad happens, you’ll have a hand to hold.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="4XTG0BU6H92W13HND1T3XK7MNW" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="4XTG0BU6H92W13HND1T3XK7MNW"&gt;Take a moment to step back&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VOVFPCVKYJCPNEMD3JJWWR5SF4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers still don’t know all of the variables that make some individuals more prone to stress contagion, but it is clear that empathy plays a role. A person with empathy deeply feels the emotions of others. That could be stress, but also emotions of happiness, anger or fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F38QDWX9TN0RQ5GZ1J7B680XC0" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“And that’s not necessarily a bad thing.

If you’re having trouble &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/08/04/stress-body-brain-reduce-steps/"&gt;breaking free from stress&lt;/a&gt;, Dimitroff said, try to find places in your life where you can improve controllability and predictability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="HDFJHHG9ZD7CF7NPMQB8X0X5DR" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="HDFJHHG9ZD7CF7NPMQB8X0X5DR"&gt;Do something you love&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7NZRAVHDHNFLXNSZOCL5HQ7K5Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Withdrawing for a bit and doing something you love, such as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2023/birds-song-nature-mental-health-benefits/"&gt;going out in nature&lt;/a&gt;, can help you avoid negativity that brings stress, Duque-Wilckens said. “That’s my go-to,” she said. “Be in nature, paint, hang out with my cats or my dog.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="M184JZ5AB119D39UM4RH4402X4" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="M184JZ5AB119D39UM4RH4402X4"&gt;Be mindful&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6AME04YE616TZA1C27ZVUU6C0R" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And be mindful not to contribute to the problem, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UYDJVX7KEH5557URHBXRVZK13C" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“There’s a very fine line between sharing information you think is important to raise awareness and overdoing it by constantly, and too quickly, sharing stressful news without taking time to reflect,” Duque-Wilckens said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D4SGTKSQKZBDTBAZPZPTHP6MLY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a question about human behavior or neuroscience?

Kennedy Jr. this week is sowing doubt about the safety and efficacy of some vaccines — beyond the measles shot — and arguing the government shouldn’t mandate their use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also raised questions about what killed an 8-year-old girl whose death was attributed to measles by health officials, his latest remarks that downplay the threat of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/rfk-jr-says-people-should-get-the-measles-vaccine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;interview with CBS News&lt;/a&gt; that aired Wednesday, the nation’s top health official said that “people should get the measles vaccine,” a more direct assertion than has been typical from Kennedy, who has a long history of questioning vaccine safety. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the same time, however, he appeared to minimize the threat of a growing outbreak centered in Texas and New Mexico and sent mixed signals about vaccines, saying many vaccines “aren’t safety tested.” He went on to argue they’re not tested against placebo groups or only over short periods of time. Public health officials across independent bodies have &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-vaccines-kennedy-confirmation-hearing-vaccination-policy-hhs-secretary/"&gt;repeatedly approved vaccines based on their safety and efficacy evidence&lt;/a&gt;, including placebo-controlled trials and long-term studies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When I say they’re not safety tested, what I mean is that they’re not adequately [tested],” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy again downplayed the outbreak in a cabinet meeting with President Trump on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to refocus the press to get them to pay attention to the chronic disease epidemic as you’ve asked us to,” he said to Trump.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He praised the administration’s handling of the disease, which he said had crept up to about 680 cases across 22 states.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The CDC has done an amazing job of getting the measles outbreak under control,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On CBS News, Kennedy also suggested that shots known as single-antigen vaccines do not work in the case of respiratory pathogens. Many vaccines, including all the licensed Covid-19 shots, are single-antigen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The interview took place after Kennedy attended the funeral of an 8-year-old in West Texas, who died of measles, according to state health officials. In the CBS News interview, Kennedy suggested that, after talking with the girl’s family and reviewing her medical charts, other diseases caused her death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jon LaPook, the CBS News medical correspondent and physician who interviewed Kennedy, corrected him, saying most individuals who die from the measles ultimately die because of complications &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;related to the disease&lt;/a&gt;, such as a secondary infection that can grow deadly because of the damage measles has done to the body. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Texas health officials described the two children who died from measles in this outbreak as “previously healthy.” Little is known about the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/06/new-mexico-adult-with-measles-dies/"&gt;adult in New Mexico with measles who also died&lt;/a&gt;. All three were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic reported Kennedy didn’t mention vaccines when visiting the family of the girl who died most recently. &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/04/rfk-measles-grieving-families-texas/682386/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The father of the girl told The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;: “He never said anything about the vaccine being helpful.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“He said, ‘You don’t know what’s in the vaccine anymore,’” the girl’s father, Peter Hildebrand, told the publication. “I actually asked him about it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The measles case numbers reported by the CDC are believed to be &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/12/measles-outbreak-larger-than-reported-public-health-experts-say/"&gt;significant underestimates&lt;/a&gt;, with some parents avoiding testing for their children. More than 10% of those cases led to hospitalization, according to CDC data. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the health secretary has downplayed the seriousness of the disease in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s only three deaths from measles in 20 years,” Kennedy told CBS News. “They’re all people with extreme complications.”&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/aside&gt;
		


&lt;p&gt;There have been three deaths so far this year, and four in the last 20 years. The fact that the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/06/measles-third-death-new-normal/"&gt;number of deaths so far in 2025&lt;/a&gt; equals the number that were recorded in the previous 24 years has infectious diseases experts concerned the country is now on a path to larger measles outbreaks and more frequent measles deaths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mixed messaging from the nation’s top health official — about whether measles is a significant threat or the vaccine is safe — are in sharp contrast with the messaging of public health experts and physicians, who fear the effects of Kennedy’s statements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is not the way to inform people about vaccination,” Tom Frieden, a physician, former CDC director, and president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, said in an interview with STAT on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some anti-vaccine groups see in Kennedy’s statements an endorsement of their long-held views.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re reading between the lines, are you?” Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine organization founded by Kennedy, recently &lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1910143192181215270" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;posted on X&lt;/a&gt;, along with a video of the HHS secretary saying he doesn’t think the vaccine should be mandated by the government. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though the federal government doesn’t mandate vaccines, Frieden said, state rules that require vaccines before children go to schools are important to protecting against measles and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Parents who don’t vaccinate their child put other children, particularly those with a medical condition that makes them vulnerable, at risk,” Frieden said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The secretary has made state policies a key target for his agenda, meeting with state leaders this week on his &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/09/rfk-jr-maha-roadshow-plays-down-measles-plays-up-fluoride-removal-nutrition/"&gt;Make America Healthy Again tour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has changed a significant amount on the issue. He has previously framed the measles vaccine as dangerous and deadly, part of his work as an anti-vaccine advocate. Over the weekend, facing a second child dying in a growing outbreak, Kennedy said the vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/06/rfk-jr-measles-statement-west-texas-outbreak/"&gt;is the best tool&lt;/a&gt; available to fight the outbreak, which has now spread across several states.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy later pointed to other tools to handle the outbreak — well outside of mainstream recommendations — as potential cures for children who get the virus. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Measles is something we shouldn’t fool around with,” Frieden said. “Measles spreads like wildfire.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the CBS News interview, Kennedy was asked about the rationale behind a recent and&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/02/top-trump-fda-official-brenner-hits-pause-on-novavax-vaccine-decision-00266623" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; controversial decision by political staff at the Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; to delay approval of the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine, which is still being used under emergency use authorization. Kennedy said “it is a single antigen vaccine. And, for respiratory illnesses, the single antigen vaccines have never worked.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(An antigen refers to the component of a vaccine that induces an immune response. Some vaccines target multiple parts of the pathogen they are designed to protect against, others focus on a single part, as is the case with Covid vaccines. They are designed to induce antibodies to the spike protein on the exterior of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In interviews with STAT, experts dismissed Kennedy’s claim. Peter Marks, the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/29/peter-marks-vaccine-regulator-fda-cber-biologics-biotech-reaction/"&gt;recently ousted&lt;/a&gt; head of the FDA’s biologics division, which regulates vaccines, said there are multiple effective vaccines for respiratory pathogens that target a single antigen.&lt;/p&gt;

These spontaneous recollections were also rated as less positive and more repetitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers set out to explore whether spontaneous remembering—unintended recollections of personal experiences—might be more frequent among people with ADHD traits. While past research has established a connection between ADHD and increased mind wandering, it was unclear whether this tendency also extended to involuntary memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies had produced mixed results. Some naturalistic studies hinted at a link between distractibility and spontaneous remembering, while others using laboratory-based measures found no such association. The authors of the current study suspected that traditional lab tasks might fail to detect real-life differences and designed two complementary studies to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first study, 453 undergraduate participants completed the Barkley Adult ADHD Rating Scale (BAARS-IV), a validated questionnaire used to identify symptoms of ADHD. Based on their scores, participants were grouped into those who scored within the ADHD range and those who did not. All participants then took part in a vigilance task, which was designed to measure spontaneous thoughts and memories in a controlled setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this task, participants viewed a sequence of slides and were asked to report any unplanned memories or thoughts they experienced. After the task, they completed a separate questionnaire asking them to estimate how often they experienced involuntary memories in their daily lives, how emotionally positive or negative these memories tended to be, and how often the same memories repeated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this first study showed no difference in the number of spontaneous memories reported during the laboratory task between those with ADHD symptoms and those without. However, the questionnaire responses painted a different picture. Participants who scored in the ADHD range estimated that they experienced significantly more involuntary memories in their daily lives compared to the other groups. They also described these memories as being less positive and more repetitive. These findings suggest that while laboratory settings may not always detect variations in spontaneous memory experiences, self-reported everyday experiences can reveal meaningful differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build on these findings, the researchers conducted a second study using a more naturalistic method. A new sample of 116 participants, including both students and community members, also completed the BAARS-IV. They were then asked to carry a pocket-sized diary for 48 hours and record every involuntary memory they experienced during that time. For each memory, they noted the time, their age in the memory, and rated its emotional tone, emotional impact, how often the memory had occurred before, and how focused their attention was at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This diary-based study provided additional support for the researchers’ expectations. Participants with ADHD-range scores recorded significantly more involuntary memories over the 48-hour period than those in the non-ADHD range. On average, they reported nearly twice as many memories. As in the first study, they also rated their memories as less emotionally positive. However, unlike the questionnaire results, there were no significant group differences in how repetitive the memories were or in attention levels reported at the time the memories occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings indicate that people with ADHD symptoms may experience more frequent spontaneous memories than others, particularly in their day-to-day lives. The difference was not apparent during a controlled laboratory task, which the researchers believe may not reflect real-world attention dynamics. In fact, they propose that the vigilance task, which includes meaningful word phrases, may actually help participants with ADHD maintain their focus, suppressing spontaneous memories that would otherwise occur in less structured settings. Alternatively, the task may have artificially elevated the rate of spontaneous memories in non-ADHD participants, masking any differences between groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diary method, in contrast, offered a more natural glimpse into how often these memories arise in ordinary circumstances. Since participants were recording experiences in real time as they went about their daily lives, this method may better reflect genuine cognitive differences between people with and without ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledged several limitations in their work. First, the participants were not formally diagnosed with ADHD, but rather scored in the ADHD range on a self-report scale. While this method is commonly used in psychological research, future studies with clinically diagnosed samples would help confirm the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also relied on self-report measures, which can be vulnerable to inaccuracies. For instance, people with ADHD may over- or underestimate how often they experience repetitive memories. Although the diary method helps address some of these concerns, it too has limitations. Participants may have forgotten to record some memories, especially if they occurred frequently, which could lead to underreporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, the study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that people with ADHD symptoms tend to experience more spontaneous cognitive events, including not only future-oriented mind wandering but also unintentional recollections of past experiences. These findings could help researchers better understand how attention and memory interact in people with attentional difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest that future research could use longer diary recording periods to capture patterns that might not appear over just two days. They also recommend further investigation into why these differences arise. While one theory holds that people with ADHD have weaker mechanisms for filtering out irrelevant memories, the evidence for this remains inconclusive. More research is needed to clarify what drives these differences in spontaneous remembering and how they affect daily functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/bjop.12749" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Involuntary remembering and ADHD: Do individuals with ADHD symptoms experience high volumes of involuntary memories in everyday life?&lt;/a&gt;“, was authored by John H.

These lesions are signs of damaged blood vessels that restrict blood flow and gradually harm brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found that heavy and former heavy drinkers had higher odds of tau tangles, a biomarker linked to Alzheimer’s disease. Former drinkers showed reduced brain mass and worse cognitive performance, and heavy drinkers died, on average, 13 years earlier than non-drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesion Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Heavy drinkers had 133% higher odds of brain lesions than non-drinkers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Tau tangles were more likely in heavy and former heavy drinkers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifespan Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Heavy drinkers died 13 years earlier than non-drinkers, on average.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heavy drinkers who have eight or more alcoholic drinks per week have an increased risk of brain lesions called hyaline arteriolosclerosis, signs of brain injury that are associated with memory and thinking problems, according to a study published on April 9, 2025, online in &lt;em&gt;Neurology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The study does not prove that heavy drinking causes brain injury; it only shows an association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyaline arteriolosclerosis is a condition that causes the small blood vessels to narrow, becoming thick and stiff. This makes it harder for blood to flow, which can damage the brain over time.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Heavy alcohol consumption is a major global health concern linked to increased health problems and death,” said study author Alberto Fernando Oliveira Justo, PhD, of University of Sao Paulo Medical School in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We looked at how alcohol affects the brain as people get older. Our research shows that heavy alcohol consumption is damaging to the brain, which can lead to memory and thinking problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 1,781 people who had an average age of 75 at death. All had brain autopsies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined brain tissue to look for signs of brain injury including tau tangles and hyaline arteriolosclerosis. They also measured brain weight and the height of each participant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family members answered questions about participants’ alcohol consumption.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers then divided the participants into four groups: 965 people who never drank, 319 moderate drinkers who had seven or fewer drinks per week; 129 heavy drinkers who had eight or more drinks per week; and 368 former heavy drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers defined one drink as having 14 grams of alcohol, which is about 350 milliliters (ml) of beer, 150 ml of wine or 45 ml of distilled spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of those who never drank, 40% had vascular brain lesions. Of the moderate drinkers, 45% had vascular brain lesions. Of the heavy drinkers, 44% had vascular brain lesions. Of the former heavy drinkers, 50% had vascular brain lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for factors that could affect brain health such as age at death, smoking and physical activity, heavy drinkers had 133% higher odds of having vascular brain lesions compared to those who never drank, former heavy drinkers had 89% higher odds and moderate drinkers, 60%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found heavy and former heavy drinkers had higher odds of developing tau tangles, a biomarker associated with Alzheimer’s disease, with 41% and 31% higher odds, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former heavy drinking was associated with a lower brain mass ratio, a smaller proportion of brain mass compared to body mass, and worse cognitive abilities. No link was found between moderate or heavy drinking and brain mass ratio or cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justo noted that, in addition to brain injuries, impaired cognitive abilities were observed only in former drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found that heavy drinkers died an average of 13 years earlier than those who never drank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found heavy drinking is directly linked to signs of injury in the brain, and this can cause long-term effects on brain health, which may impact memory and thinking abilities,” said Justo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding these effects is crucial for public health awareness and continuing to implement preventive measures to reduce heavy drinking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the study was that it did not look at participants before death and did not have information on the duration of alcohol consumption and cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by The São Paulo Research Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AUD and cognition research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3f515c50514d5e5b7f5e5e51115c5052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Natalie Conrad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aan.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Natalie Conrad – AAN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 13:17:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5pX3lsQlVlZ3pKOUN5YlpzNVg2LTZRdnR6OXBUeTJucURwOXN5b3VYalk5aDJRWWw2R094MnpfR1lXeHlNem5BalFTSUUteTE5dzREdjQtRTlfN1FFTnJFbTEybnZhWDZVTnJTUlh3R2M</guid></item><item><title>Dopamine changes from cannabis are linked to psychosis - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPRHJqbWNBY0Y5d2ZmelJmdEdLREYxUWtndng2NmJvNENVUy13ek5rb09sb1JJTG5NcWo5OUYwa24tX1Vscl9BYkRzbEJKRE03WDEyRnlYbHR1UGp3NFBWaHBjVVdQRjBlUmFleHR0WjNtbEwyRGJaV0VWSDlKYzUtdk9iY2FvNHBC?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six years after cannabis legalization in Canada, scientists are still mapping its long-term health effects. While social and medical benefits remain under review, emerging neuroscience now highlights a key concern – psychosis linked to dopamine changes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study led by Canadian researchers has found biological evidence linking frequent &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/medicinal-cannabis-helped-patients-feel-better-for-a-full-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cannabis use&lt;/a&gt; to changes in brain chemistry that resemble those seen in early psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a cutting-edge brain scan called neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the experts observed elevated dopamine activity in people with cannabis use disorder (CUD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This increase occurred in the same brain areas previously tied to hallucinations, delusions, and other symptoms of psychotic disorders. The findings appeared in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, in a study titled “&lt;em&gt;Convergence of Cannabis and Psychosis on the Dopamine System&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, spanning five years and several institutions, marks a turning point in how clinicians and researchers understand cannabis’ psychiatric risks. The analysis bridges the gap between clinical symptoms and underlying brain activity – something long sought but rarely demonstrated so clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-builds-dopamine-in-key-brain-areas"&gt;Cannabis builds dopamine in key brain areas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine helps the brain regulate mood, motivation, learning, and motor control. It also plays a central role in psychosis. High dopamine activity, especially in the striatum and midbrain, has been linked to schizophrenia and related disorders. What remained uncertain was how &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cbd-reduces-the-unwanted-side-effects-of-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; fit into that picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used neuromelanin-MRI – a non-invasive method that visualizes dopamine activity indirectly by tracking neuromelanin, a vital compound in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuromelanin is a dark pigment that accumulates as dopamine breaks down over time. The more dopamine activity, the more neuromelanin remains behind. In brain scans, this pigment shows up as darkened regions, especially in two key midbrain areas: the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In people partaking in excess cannabis use, those spots are blacker than what they should be for their age compared to healthy individuals,” said Lena Palaniyappan, professor at McGill University and senior author of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This indicates they have high levels of dopamine, and in some cases are showing pigments someone 10 years older would have.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-use-elevates-dopamine-signals"&gt;Cannabis use elevates dopamine signals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was focused on 61 individuals aged 18 to 35 from London, Ontario. Participants included people with CUD, those with early psychosis, some with both conditions, and healthy controls. The researchers tracked changes in neuromelanin-MRI signals across the groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that those with CUD – regardless of schizophrenia diagnosis – had elevated neuromelanin signals in a subregion of the midbrain tied to psychosis. This was not a temporary spike. Even after one year, the signal remained high, suggesting that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-related-anxiety-may-be-reduced-with-citrus-based-oil-d-limonene/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt;-related dopamine changes may have a lasting effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding was dose-dependent. Individuals with more severe CUD symptoms showed stronger signal intensity, confirming that frequency and severity of cannabis use matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now have evidence that shows a straight line linking cannabis with dopamine and psychosis that has never been shown before, and it’s crucial that clinicians, patients, and families work together to break this line,” said Palaniyappan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-increases-the-risk-of-psychosis"&gt;Cannabis increases the risk of psychosis &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-use-impacts-working-memory-and-brain-function/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cannabis&lt;/a&gt;’ effects on dopamine have long been disputed. Previous PET scans often showed mixed results – some indicating lowered dopamine synthesis, others showing a spike only after THC administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuromelanin-MRI offers a longer-term view, revealing cumulative dopamine activity, not just momentary shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants with CUD had consistently higher neuromelanin signal across multiple scans, even when researchers accounted for nicotine use and other variables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, participants with first-episode schizophrenia (FES) did not show significant changes unless they also had CUD, which suggests cannabis itself may play a more central role than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could help explain why cannabis use increases the risk of hallucinations and delusions, key symptoms of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders,” said Jessica Ahrens, a PhD student at McGill University and lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-induced-psychosis-is-rising"&gt;Cannabis-induced psychosis is rising &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canadian emergency departments have reported more cases of cannabis-induced psychosis since legalization. Psychiatrists working with young adults are observing troubling patterns. Brief episodes are turning into more severe psychotic breaks over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the last several years since legalization, we’re seeing adolescents who have two or three brief cannabis-induced episodes of psychosis and then have a much more major episode,” said Dr. Julie Richard, psychiatrist and physician lead at PEPP, a specialized early psychosis program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, we’re trying to counsel adolescents within that first episode that they’re pushing their brain towards a major episode and show them the areas in the brain that are impacted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new imaging data now offers a visual tool that can support those conversations. Showing young people their own brain scans could help clinicians explain the risks more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dopamine-changes-persist-after-one-year"&gt;Dopamine changes persist after one year&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the experts found no evidence that continued cannabis use beyond a certain point further increased dopamine activity. This suggests that dopamine-related changes may plateau after repeated exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, this stability does not mean the brain returns to normal. Elevated neuromelanin signals remained even a year later, indicating lasting effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Increased dopamine functioning in the SN/VTA may be associated with the risk of psychosis in people with cannabis use disorder,” the authors wrote. This midbrain region – the source of dopamine projections to other brain areas – appears central to how cannabis affects mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The absence of a “recovery effect” raises new questions: Can these changes be reversed with abstinence? Do they set the stage for future psychiatric illness? Larger, long-term studies will be needed to explore these questions further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-guiding-public-health-and-prevention"&gt;Guiding public health and prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors emphasized that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/high-potency-cannabis-use-linked-to-epigenetic-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; alone does not cause psychosis in every user. But it raises the risk, especially in those with family histories or early symptoms. By linking cannabis use to measurable brain changes, this study helps move the discussion from speculation to science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lack of clear biological evidence linking cannabis to psychosis has made it harder to persuade young people with psychotic symptoms to reduce their use,” said Palaniyappan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings could help doctors and mental health professionals better educate patients about the potential risks of frequent cannabis use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hope these findings lead patients and health-care providers to better understand the implications and for the health-care providers to give patients resources for options other than cannabis to help them cope,” Jessica Ahrens added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-and-dopamine-help-explain-psychosis"&gt;Cannabis and dopamine help explain psychosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study does not aim to demonize cannabis but to understand its effects better. With its use becoming more socially accepted and legally accessible, especially among youth, understanding its neurological footprint is urgent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis use disorder is now more than a behavioral diagnosis. It is increasingly linked to real, visible changes in the brain’s dopamine system that may shape vulnerability to psychosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For clinicians, families, and users themselves, this information could lead to more informed decisions and safer outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2832297" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-ralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 13:08:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPRHJqbWNBY0Y5d2ZmelJmdEdLREYxUWtndng2NmJvNENVUy13ek5rb09sb1JJTG5NcWo5OUYwa24tX1Vscl9BYkRzbEJKRE03WDEyRnlYbHR1UGp3NFBWaHBjVVdQRjBlUmFleHR0WjNtbEwyRGJaV0VWSDlKYzUtdk9iY2FvNHBC</guid></item><item><title>10 small things neurologists wish you’d do for your brain - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOLXNzbHhvWmc3MjZLNDFGMy10SllJbTloRkdOWjBHMWVHZ3cxMHlWbGtpQmFyUnlJZHRzbzN1d2huNUhrZGFidzZ2aWRCNl9JMDNOekZYRC1EY2h6aUpSYWVoVDBUTzQxY3poak9zV1B3QzBhTjFScE5MOVlVTDJOSXBuYmlCbnZvSlBMR2QtQWdKVWVEN1VmM1p6T2U5RkluV3hsX3YzNnpvUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOLXNzbHhvWmc3MjZLNDFGMy10SllJbTloRkdOWjBHMWVHZ3cxMHlWbGtpQmFyUnlJZHRzbzN1d2huNUhrZGFidzZ2aWRCNl9JMDNOekZYRC1EY2h6aUpSYWVoVDBUTzQxY3poak9zV1B3QzBhTjFScE5MOVlVTDJOSXBuYmlCbnZvSlBMR2QtQWdKVWVEN1VmM1p6T2U5RkluV3hsX3YzNnpvUQ?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;10 small things neurologists wish you’d do for your brain&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxOQUFVNHFEM0tQMi1zU0dwNktqRGZadWJmQ3N4MlV3aEk1bEFCMWJ5TWloZHp1MUNoM29hYU9XNWl4Y1BlMXVQSlhLVU9nT2ktbm9IaDB0Qm5LQlN3bjBTanFmTExlczdPT1VPT0w5ZmlRRGJZclktRkFxd1NZTFZXSEV4dldCQdIBiwFBVV95cUxNUC1KaU9SdWlYMVhyaUNNNEpEMURtZnlVYVlrODktdE5GQU8yNEZUTkloaHNiLV9qTVIzQTlfc0FKRlgzcUlMQTd5eU5yczk0dHh1WE01WXpTY0FubTVMY3hvTTgxMzZ3UGNZc28wU1ZjTmhTcXNOQ21uV1E0U0pzaFJ5YWhUbTRsclJv?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Doctor says these fish and veg 'effective at combating dementia'&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Surrey Live&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 13:01:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOLXNzbHhvWmc3MjZLNDFGMy10SllJbTloRkdOWjBHMWVHZ3cxMHlWbGtpQmFyUnlJZHRzbzN1d2huNUhrZGFidzZ2aWRCNl9JMDNOekZYRC1EY2h6aUpSYWVoVDBUTzQxY3poak9zV1B3QzBhTjFScE5MOVlVTDJOSXBuYmlCbnZvSlBMR2QtQWdKVWVEN1VmM1p6T2U5RkluV3hsX3YzNnpvUQ</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Discover Unexpected Link Between Diet And Lung Cancer Risk - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxOUVpXTDVPTHlSS3pyaW44RmVmT1ZSNFVadnloM0E1dHZpbWJzLVBYeUpodGhBbU8xVWNoM3F5RmJ3Z25KMXU0ck9LMTVGLTY1S3dHVFlwSVRpaF9EMnQ1TDcxWjd2emhGZVQ0U05HQ1dKd0RBWThKdnFCVVIzenVYR1VjQlB3NWhIaGFLbEhaRDdMT1d3amhRdWFyTV85T3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Most of us would probably &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-cigarette-steals-20-minutes-of-your-life-expectancy-study-finds"&gt;think of smoking&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-3-years-of-air-pollution-can-increase-lung-cancer-risk-study-warns"&gt;air pollution&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to lung  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="157643" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; risk, but researchers have discovered an intriguing link between the disease and the quality of our diets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers, from the University of Florida and the University of Kentucky, found that the molecule &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen"&gt;glycogen&lt;/a&gt;, which stores the simple sugar glucose, could potentially act as a driver of some types of lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycogen was found at higher levels in human tissue samples of &lt;a href="https://www.lungevity.org/lung-cancer-basics/types-of-lung-cancer/lung-adenocarcinoma"&gt;lung adenocarcinoma&lt;/a&gt;, the type responsible for 40 percent of lung cancers worldwide. In tests on mice, the team found that more glycogen helped lung cancers to grow faster, while taking the molecule away led to restricted tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_157646" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157646" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/LungImages.jpg" alt="Lung tissue image" class="wp-image-157646 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/LungImages.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/LungImages-600x333.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-157646" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at glycogen levels in lung tissue. (Clarke et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study relies on a technique called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-023-00881-0"&gt;spatial metabolomics&lt;/a&gt;, which enables scientists to identify specific small molecule characteristics in the context of their location inside tissue. Here, the team used a platform designed for tissue analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This platform offered a new lens through which to visualize diseases, enabling researchers to discern previously undiscovered molecular patterns and interactions with striking detail and depth of insight," &lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/news/2025/eat-better-breathe-easier-research-points-to-link-between-diet-lung-cancer"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; molecular biologist Ramon Sun, from the University of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have been looking at glycogen and its relationship to different types of cancer &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00109-015-1377-9"&gt;for some time&lt;/a&gt;. It appears this energy source can act like a sweet treat for cancer cells, giving it the fuel to grow fast enough to overwhelm our natural immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that glycogen &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-lose-more-than-fat-on-a-diet-and-the-consequences-are-serious"&gt;comes from the carbohydrates we eat&lt;/a&gt;, and is an important fuel reserve in our muscles that our bodies &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-15-minutes-of-intense-activity-can-improve-heart-health"&gt;tap into when we exercise&lt;/a&gt;. It essentially stores glucose that isn't needed right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also something that builds up as a result of a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. In this study, mice that were fed this diet saw much higher levels of lung cancer growth than mice fed either high-fat, high-carb, or control diets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further research will be needed to confirm a link to diet and lung cancer in humans, but it seems there's an association of some kind here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the long term, our approach to cancer prevention should mirror the success of the anti-smoking campaign – placing greater emphasis on public awareness and policy-driven strategies that promote healthier dietary choices as a fundamental component of disease prevention," &lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/news/2025/eat-better-breathe-easier-research-points-to-link-between-diet-lung-cancer"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that the higher glycogen levels were only noted in tissue samples of lung adenocarcinoma in humans, not in other types of lung cancer – such as &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung-a-to-z"&gt;lung squamous cell carcinoma&lt;/a&gt;. This is something that will need further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, it's a reminder of just how important our diets are when it comes to overall health. Just as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-diet-change-could-slash-the-risk-of-bowel-cancer-in-men-study-finds"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-report-links-alcohol-to-six-major-cancer-types"&gt;alcoholic drinks&lt;/a&gt; are believed to contribute to risk levels for certain types of cancer, we may soon have to add lung cancer to the list of risks associated with the Western-style diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Lung cancer has not traditionally been thought of as a dietary-related disease," &lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/news/2025/eat-better-breathe-easier-research-points-to-link-between-diet-lung-cancer"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sun. "Diseases like pancreatic cancer or liver cancer, yes. However, when it comes to lung cancer, the idea that diet could play a role is rarely discussed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01243-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A common treatment for back pain is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen, and muscle relaxants like cyclobenzaprine, but they have a high risk for abuse and overdose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2022, nearly 110,000 Americans died from drug overdoses, and more than 81,000 deaths involved either prescription or illicit opioids - an increase of approximately 400 percent over a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is hoped that promoting mindfulness-based practices as an alternative to opioid use for pain management could potentially help reduce the opioid epidemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the study, participants were divided equally between the two treatment approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both treatments involved eight weekly two-hour group sessions led by experienced therapists, with recommended daily home practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the course of 12 months, both groups showed significant improvements with less intense pain, improved physical function, and an improved quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also found the participants' reliance on drugs had decreased. It is unclear what medications they were prescribed for their pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initially, researchers believed MBT would prove more effective, but both therapies were found to provide similar relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers concluded: 'MBT and CBT were associated with safe improvements in pain and functional outcomes among adults affected with refractory, complex, opioid-treated chronic lower back pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We need to better understand how to support dissemination and implementation of evidence-based psychological treatments for chronic pain and their coverage by health plans.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other studies have shown mind hacks to be just as effective as drugs to treat various ailments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2015 study published in The Lancet, found mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) led to similar outcomes as antidepressants when treating the mental disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the average pain severity, based on the Brief Pain Inventory score (BPI), over 12 months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows physical limitations people with back pain experienced measured using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found patients on a MBCT course suffered almost the same rates of recurrence as those taking anti-depressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over two years, relapse rates were 44 percent in the MBCT group compared to 47 per cent in the medication group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This suggests it offers an 'alternative treatment' for those averse to the idea of taking drugs, said the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, CBT is a very popular and well-researched form of psychotherapy in the US and often considered a first-line treatment for various mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, experts believe it could be used in other situations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one study, it was found that CBT may work better for people suffering from irritable bowel syndrome than medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study of more than 500 patients found counselling over the phone or online significantly reduced painful symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Up to 15 percent of Americans suffer from IBS, which mainly causes abdominal pain, bloating and the embarrassment of having to rush to the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But experts say less than half benefit from drugs such as laxatives or fiber supplements, which doctors are recommended to prescribe in the first instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers led by the University of Southampton in the UK looked at IBS sufferers on the standard treatment of medication, comparing them with those also given CBT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found patients given the talking therapy, with either a manual or website to work through, saw their symptoms get much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Not just any breast cancer—this one targets triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive and hardest to treat. Unlike other vaccines, it doesn’t just help the immune system respond after cancer shows up. It teaches your body to stop cancer before it even starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this bold effort is a vaccine developed through a partnership between &lt;a href="https://www.anixa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Anixa Biosciences&lt;/a&gt; in San Jose, California and the Cleveland Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After decades of research and a recent clinical trial, the results are now being called “incredibly promising.” The vaccine works by training your immune system to recognize and destroy specific cancer-linked proteins before they can grow into tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_different_kind_of_protection"&gt;A Different Kind of Protection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most vaccines you’ve heard of are designed to prevent &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-antiviral-chewing-gum-blocks-influenza-and-other-infectious-diseases/"&gt;infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt;. This one is different. It targets a protein called alpha-lactalbumin. This protein is normally found in breast tissue during lactation but reappears in many TNBC tumors. If your body learns to recognize this protein as a threat, it may stop those cancer cells before they spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The vaccine targets a lactation protein called α-lactalbumin, which is no longer found after lactation in normal, aging tissues but is present in most triple-negative breast cancers. If breast cancer develops, the vaccine is designed to prompt the immune system to attack the tumor and keep it from growing. (CREDIT: Cleveland Clinic) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the idea behind the vaccine, and it’s showing real signs of success in early trials. Sixteen women took part in the first phase of testing. All had already completed treatment for TNBC. They received three doses of the vaccine over a span of six weeks. Doctors measured signs of immune activity through increases in key markers: IFNγ and IL-17, both of which suggest T-cell activity, and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/crispr-gene-editing-breakthrough-eliminates-50-of-head-neck-tumors/"&gt;specific antibodies&lt;/a&gt; that signal a strong immune defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Day 14, levels of IL-17 had risen sharply. By Day 56, IFNγ levels had also increased significantly. In total, 12 out of the 16 women showed clear T-cell responses that met the trial’s strict standards. These results suggest the vaccine is doing what it was designed to do—stimulate a strong immune reaction against potential cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="no_major_side_effects"&gt;No Major Side Effects&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more encouraging is how well patients tolerated the vaccine. The maximum tolerated dose—10 micrograms of alpha-lactalbumin combined with 10 micrograms of zymosan—caused only mild irritation at the injection site. There were no flu-like symptoms, no &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/scientists-discover-protein-that-could-restore-youthful-muscle-strength/"&gt;muscle aches&lt;/a&gt;, and no troubling lab results. This is a critical step forward for any new vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Phase 2 study trial is expected to commence this year and is projected to last approximately two to three years. Immunological responses to the vaccine will be made available as the trial advances, providing a faster and more cost-effective path toward potential approval and/or partnerships with pharmaceutical companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are excited to unveil our Phase 2 study plan, bringing us one step closer to a potentially transformative therapy for breast cancer patients," said Dr. Amit Kumar. "By targeting treatment rather than prevention, we can reach a broader patient population and potentially expedite the process of regulatory approval and partnerships. This trial marks a key milestone in advancing our mission to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/lab-grown-t-cells-engineered-to-live-longer-and-fight-cancer-more-effectively/"&gt;fight cancer&lt;/a&gt; through innovative therapies. While our Phase 2 trial focuses on the therapeutic market, with the data obtained in this trial, we expect to conduct additional, more informed studies for both recurrence prevention and primary prevention with partners in the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;G. Thomas Budd, M.D. (CREDIT: Cleveland Clinic) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="one_woman_s_brave_first_step"&gt;One Woman’s Brave First Step&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Davis became the first person in the world to receive this vaccine in October 2021. Her story began three years earlier, when she sensed something wasn’t right despite an early biopsy that showed no signs of cancer. She pushed for more testing and, at 41, was diagnosed with TNBC. With no family history of cancer, she underwent chemotherapy, a double mastectomy, and radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reaching remission, she joined the clinical trial at Cleveland Clinic. Davis, a registered nurse, felt confident joining after hearing about the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-vaccine-successfully-treats-skin-and-pancreatic-cancer/"&gt;vaccine’s success&lt;/a&gt; in animal trials. “That was all I needed to hear,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is how we advance medicine,” Davis said. “It’s important to be a part of those things. I am just beyond grateful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tragically, on January 31, 2024, Jennifer Davis delivered heartbreaking news to those closest to her: her cancer had returned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;She urged her friends not to lose momentum in their advocacy. “She said, ‘I had the lowest dose. Do not let this stop your efforts. There are so many women out there that we need to save.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Jennifer Davis, a resilient woman from a small Ohio town, holds a special place in this milestone. She became the world's first recipient of the vaccine.

It took 20 years just to reach the human trial phase, and Jennifer proudly became the very first recipient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think she was meant to receive that first dose,” Laura said. “She was so strong, so positive, and she believed there was something else out there.” Though she understood the early-stage trial was just the beginning, Jennifer held onto hope—not just for herself, but for the future of countless others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, on April 13, 2024, Jennifer passed away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_long_road_to_a_breakthrough"&gt;A Long Road to a Breakthrough&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The roots of this vaccine trace back more than 20 years. Much of the early science was developed by the late Dr. Vincent Tuohy at Cleveland Clinic. Years later, Dr. Amit Kumar, CEO of a biotech company called Anixa Biosciences, saw the early data and immediately recognized the potential. “I looked at it and I saw the vision,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="21" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kumar and his team partnered with the Cleveland Clinic and secured funding from the U.S. Department of Defense to run the Phase 1 trial. They are now implementing the Phase 2 study involving 600 women. In this trial, half will receive the vaccine and the other half will receive a &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-shingles-vaccine-significantly-reduces-dementia-risk/"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;. If successful, the researchers hope to win FDA approval within five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="22" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This vaccine is designed to direct the immune system to destroy TNBC cancer cells through a mechanism that has never previously been utilized for cancer vaccine development,” Kumar said. “Our goal is to initially evaluate the vaccine’s ability to prevent recurrence of cancer in survivors, and continue with extension studies to eventually determine its effectiveness in preventing the initial onset of TNBC.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="23" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked if the vaccine teaches the body not to grow tumors, Kumar responded, “That’s exactly right. It’s teaching your body to destroy the cells that can grow a tumor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_new_way_to_think_about_cancer"&gt;A New Way to Think About Cancer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="24" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human immune system is excellent at fighting off &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/microbial-infections-in-the-brain-might-play-a-significant-role-in-dementia-and-alzheimer/"&gt;viruses and bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. But cancer is harder to stop because it begins in your own cells. “All of the cells that become cancerous in your body came from normal, healthy cells,” Kumar explained. “The difference is not big, so the immune system has a harder time recognizing a cancer cell and distinguishing it from a healthy cell.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;A researcher conducts a breast cancer vaccine related experiment in a lab at Cleveland Clinic. (CREDIT: Cleveland Clinic) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="25" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By focusing on alpha-lactalbumin, which is not present in normal breast tissue after lactation, the vaccine gives the immune system a clearer target.

Do you ever lay in bed at night overthinking all of the embarrassing things you've done since childhood?

Science behind it is fascinating!', another wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'DIY EMDR therapy,' a second said, with a third adding: 'Sounds like the same science behind EMDR therapy'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;EMDR is recommended by NHS watchdog the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to help treat PTSD alongside other talking therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sleep deprivation can lead to obesity, memory loss, diabetes, heart disease, heightened and unstable emotions, impaired ability to learn and a reduced immune response, leaving you vulnerable to disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While the method isn't a replacement for professional support, many praised Dr Whittington's advice to ease the nightly onslaught of overthinking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It uses one of two ways to process memories — moving your eyes from side to side or tapping from side to side. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is believed to stimulate either side of your brain in an alternating left-right fashion to help you access your subconscious mind and process what is stored in there and how it affects you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People often take around 10 to 20 minutes normally to nod off after turning off the lights, the Sleep Foundation say.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last year, a study found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; that around one in six Brits suffer insomnia, yet 65 per cent never seek help for their sleep problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The poll of 2,000 people, by The Sleep Charity, found nine in ten experience some sort of sleep problem, while one in two engage in high-risk or dangerous behaviours when unable to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Poor sleep has been linked to a number of health problems, including &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-c8412070-d4c2-11ef-a087-8dda3d723b5a"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, stroke and infertility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts have long advised that waking up during the night does not necessarily mean you have insomnia, which figures suggest &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-13345721/Do-undiagnosed-sleep-disorder-Warning-14million-Brits-unknowingly-living-condition-prove-dangerous-cost-NHS-billions.html"&gt;affects up to 14million Brits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, sleep deprivation takes its own toll, from irritability and reduced focus in the short term, to an increased risk of obesity, heart disease and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-e4b36540-d983-11ef-bf36-47316f776e33"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the American Sleep Association, nearly 70 million Americans also have a sleep disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-d5cba4c0-15f1-11f0-856d-25ce04a1124c" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14591519/Doctor-technique-beat-overthinking-insomnia-infinity-tracing.html"&gt;&lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;HOW MUCH SLEEP SHOULD YOU GET?

During spring/summer try sleeping with your bedroom window open to reduce the temperature and increase ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;5) Limit alcohol in the evenings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While you might initially fall into deep sleep more easily, you then wake up frequently during the night and have poorer deep sleep overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;6) Supplement vitamin D&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin D plays a role in sleep. Vitamin D is widely available online and from most pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you are unsure if this is appropriate or how much you need, seek advice from your GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;7) Ensure sufficient intake of magnesium and zinc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Foods high in magnesium include spinach, kale, avocado, bananas, cashews, and seeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Foods high in zinc include meat, oysters, crab, cheese, cooked lentils, and dark chocolate (70%+).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 11:39:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxNelpoQW1JQ1FxenYxcmNDRHlZaUxwdE9aSVNPemp1NDl3OEItYTdsN3N5Qld1YzN6VTlNZlhYS255ZklEaEVjTUdiSjgxN2lGRXEtUGZEMkhwci14QTdRU1FnWHlwek5YT3hHdXhwb3QyZjlwcEhQazRfYXV3cVNMUnhrVVdjVjc2d01QREd1a3ZEdlJpa1loZGJpWGN2Mzh6MjM0VlZpT3NNUkN6RU9leEJlMlJfQ1BQ0gG-AUFVX3lxTE5OV1BMME9SdGNxdTJWNlV1Vnk3SElBMXluTUhXNGZvQS1RNExqdVUtMXp0N2lUcTM4QUpyMGtCbkZfSzNjdUVobXloRGtFeWNkYWhFOWRDQkIxRllzeUFjVmhXeGU2aGtLZnpsU2pqUkozcmFXWnp6eFNfZTJZMVNEZ2JhWHZKeTVFNFJKeGFiZl9LMHRxX2FENlB2MVFZZHJOaEJ0WGZxNXlQUGtIMGtVc1R0d1BxZ0RmMnRNLXc</guid></item><item><title>An Experimental Obesity Pill Mimics Gastric Bypass Surgery - WIRED</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTFB1bVZFN0tHTjNiaHNSenJzcnh2UXhKUlExWWsxelZqRUVIWHZlT2ZMNHBMRjBuQUR0MnZEZVY0ZnNxcXk5M0EzVmJ1R2NHUERmNnBSMU1Tdkh3QzBnNE1xMThZMXU5N20tQUZFQXZnMVByQi1za0JoUDN3Yw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The drug is based on research conducted at MIT by Giovanni Traverso, a gastroenterologist and mechanical engineer, and Robert Langer, a chemical engineer who has launched more than two dozen biotech companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The two discovered the mechanism when working on a way to develop liquid drug formulations that could be given to children. They soon realized they could make this temporary synthetic coating more or less permeable, to either enhance absorption or slow it down. That latter ability was appealing as a treatment for obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“This material is something you would take as a capsule or liquid, but the next day it's gone because of the natural turnover of our mucosal surface in the GI tract,” Traverso says. He and Langer cofounded Syntis with Dhanda in 2022. He likens this coating to what mussels and other shellfish use to stick to rocks or the ocean floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In the results Syntis announced, the drug was delivered in a liquid form via a tube directly to the small intestine so that researchers could check that the polymer coating formed as expected. A tablet form has already been tested in pigs and dogs, and it’s what Syntis plans to test in future human studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In rats, the drug produced a consistent 1 percent weekly weight loss over a six-week study period while preserving 100 percent of lean muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In a first-in-human pilot study of nine participants, the drug was safe with no adverse effects. Tissue samples taken from the intestine were used to confirm that the coating formed and was also cleared from the body within 24 hours. The study wasn’t designed to assess weight loss, but blood testing showed that after the drug was given, glucose levels and the “hunger hormone” ghrelin were lower while the levels of leptin, an appetite-regulating hormone, were higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“When nutrients are redirected to later in the intestine, you're activating pathways that lead towards satiety, energy expenditure, and overall healthy, sustainable weight loss,” Dhanda says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Syntis Bio’s findings in animals also hint at the drug’s potential for weight loss without compromising muscle mass, one of the concerns with current GLP-1 drugs. While weight loss in general is associated with numerous health benefits, there’s &lt;a data-offer-url="https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/dom.15728" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/dom.15728"}' href="https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/dom.15728" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;growing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(24)00272-9/abstract"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that the kind of drastic weight loss that GLP-1s induce can also lead to a loss of lean muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Louis Aronne, an obesity medicine specialist and professor of metabolic research at Weill-Cornell Medical College, says that while GLP-1s are wildly popular, they may not be right for everyone. He predicts that in the not-so-distant future there will be many drugs for obesity and treatment will be more personalized. “I think Syntis’ compound fits in perfectly as a treatment that could be used early on. It’s a kind of thing you could use as a first-line medication,” he says. Arrone serves as a clinical adviser to the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Vladimir Kushnir, professor of medicine and director of bariatric endoscopy at Washington University in St. Louis, who isn’t involved with Syntis, says the early pilot data is encouraging, but it’s hard to draw any conclusions from such a small study. He expects that the drug will make people feel fuller but could also have some of the same side effects as gastric bypass surgery. “My anticipation is that this is going to have some digestive side effects like bloating and abdominal cramping, as well as potentially some diarrhea and nausea once it gets into a bigger study,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;It’s early days for this novel technique, but if it proves effective, it could one day be an alternative or add-on drug to GLP-1 medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTFB1bVZFN0tHTjNiaHNSenJzcnh2UXhKUlExWWsxelZqRUVIWHZlT2ZMNHBMRjBuQUR0MnZEZVY0ZnNxcXk5M0EzVmJ1R2NHUERmNnBSMU1Tdkh3QzBnNE1xMThZMXU5N20tQUZFQXZnMVByQi1za0JoUDN3Yw</guid></item><item><title>Experts sound alarm as new research identifies major threat to heart health: 'Less able to tolerate additional stressors' - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNVlF4NmFNTUtzcThjRmVVRjRjV3JHdWh1S2dZRVZpTDlFVGhiTC02OFZ1eWRIYUJtdWZWaWd1bG0tcDBvem83T2RkQlZMQ3RwVWVvSjRaeGFmdEdlNGlJa2lvQUV2eFdFSTU3ZlpuSWV1SEg2RmVnWWJSNTdkMDRrSHBJYXpRTVdR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts are sounding the alarm after &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/circ.150.suppl_1.4144036" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a new study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; revealed a possible link between air pollution and negative heart health.

                Researchers integrated four organoids that represent the four components of the human sensory pathway, along which pain signals are conveyed to the brain. Stimulation of the sensory organoid (top) by substances, such as capsaicin, triggers neuronal activity that is then transmitted throughout the rest of the organoids.

   &lt;p&gt;Scientists have re-created a pain pathway in the brain by growing four key clusters of human nerve cells in a dish.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This laboratory model could be used to help explain certain pain syndromes, and offer a new way to test potential analgesic drugs, a Stanford team &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08808-3" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's exciting," says &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/stephen-waxman/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Stephen Waxman&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at Yale School of Medicine who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Currently, prospective pain drugs are typically tested in animals — whose responses are often different than a human's — and in individual nerve cells, which may not reflect the behavior of entire brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;With this new system, known as a brain assembloid, "we have a miniature nervous system that might be a very useful platform," Waxman says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pathway with several stops&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The model is the result of an effort to re-create the signaling chain that occurs after exposure to painful stimuli, says &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/sergiu-pasca" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Sergiu Pașca&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at Stanford University who led the project.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Touch a hot stove, for example, and special cells in the skin "send that information all the way to the spinal cord," Pașca says. "Then the spinal cord will relay it up to the thalamus deep in the brain, and then all the way to the outer layer of the brain, which is the cortex."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To approximate this pathway in the lab, Pașca's team created four different &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/08/29/755410121/after-months-in-a-dish-lab-grown-minibrains-start-making-brain-waves" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;brain organoids&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, spherical clumps of human nerve cells that grow in a dish. The team coaxed each organoid to resemble one specific type of brain or spinal tissue found along the pain pathway.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"And then we put them together, really put them in close proximity, and watched them as they connected with each other," Pașca says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After more than six months developing in the lab, the resulting &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/10/02/1202749791/new-tool-study-genetics-autism-schizophrenia-brain-disorders" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;assembloid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had created a pathway linking the four organoids. The nerve cells also spontaneously began "working in a coordinated fashion across the four parts of this assembloid," Pașca says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chili peppers and pain syndromes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To test the model, the team exposed it to capsaicin, the chemical that makes chili peppers painfully hot.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Then you start seeing that information traveling," Pașca says. "The neurons that sense these signals get activated and they transmit that information to the next station and the next station, all the way to the cortex."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Next, the scientists tried creating assembloids using cells with genetic variants linked to abnormal pain perception.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of these variants causes a rare condition called &lt;a href="https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/erythromelalgia/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;erythromelalgia,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or man-on-fire syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"These individuals feel searing, burning, scalding pain in response to mild warmth," Waxman says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The scientists found that assembloids with the gene variant produced much more spontaneous communication between organoids, suggesting a heightened sensitivity to pain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Results like that suggest that organoids are already a useful way to study both nervous system diseases and the pathways they affect, says &lt;a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8945416" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Guo-li Ming&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine who also had no role in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For all its complexity,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the pain pathway in a dish is a highly simplified version of what goes on in a person, Ming adds. For example, humans have two major pathways that carry pain signals to the brain, while the model system includes just one.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As a result, the model can detect a painful stimulus, but doesn't produce an emotional response, Pasca says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So we don't believe that this pathway that we've built is in any way feeling pain," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And these clusters of human cells are likely to become even more valuable as scientists find ways to re-create larger and more complex parts of the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, Ming's own lab has developed a model of a human neural tube, the structure in an embryo that eventually becomes into a baby's brain and spinal cord. Her goal is to understand how neurological disorders develop early in life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If you’re looking to live longer and healthier, you’re better off doing “what science and history have confirmed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here are some of the experts’ suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-16863476"&gt;Work out. It doesn’t matter where.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;High-end gyms might have personal trainers and fancy biometric measurements to track your heart rate and blood oxygen levels. But it’s the exercise itself that’s proven to extend your health and life spans, and you can get the same physical benefits by working out on your own, said Roger Fielding, a senior scientist at the U.S.D.A. Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University. Cardio exercise and strength training are both linked to &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.058162" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;lower mortality&lt;/a&gt; because they reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease. Just walking 30 minutes per day around your neighborhood can significantly reduce your risk; so can doing &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/01/well/move/strength-exercises-aging.html" title=""&gt;higher intensity workouts&lt;/a&gt; or resistance training using dumbbells at home, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;American Heart Association recommends&lt;/a&gt; at least 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity aerobic exercise (like walking) or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise (like running or swimming) to prevent cardiovascular disease.

                One-year-old River Jacobs is held by his mother, Caitlin Fuller, while he receives an MMR vaccine from Raynard Covarrubio, at a vaccine clinic held by the Lubbock Public Health Department on March 1 in Lubbock, Texas. A measles outbreak in West Texas has led to more than 500 cases, 57 hospitalizations and the deaths of two school-age children.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;More than a dozen vaccination clinics were canceled in Pima County, Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So was a media blitz to bring low-income children in Washoe County, Nevada, up to date on their shots.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Planned clinics were also scuttled in&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/texas-measles-outbreak-dallas-vaccines-hhs-funding-cuts-rcna199144" target="_blank"&gt; Texas&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0vE9f_0Gdo" target="_blank"&gt; Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/vaccine-clinics-canceled-health-jobs-cut-as-feds-rescind-grants-to-wa" target="_blank"&gt; Washington&lt;/a&gt;, among other places.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Immunization efforts across the country were upended after the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/hhs-covid-pandemic-trump-cdc-309fedec9383dc4fdacba6e9ca2b5309" target="_blank"&gt; abruptly canceled $11.4 billion&lt;/a&gt; in COVID-related funds for state and local health departments in late March.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A federal judge&lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.rid.59214/gov.uscourts.rid.59214.54.0.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;u&gt;temporarily blocked the cuts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week in some states, including Arizona, after a group of state Attorneys General sued. In addition, many of the organizations that receive the funds said they must proceed as though they're gone. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;All the disruption is raising public health concerns amid a resurgence of measles, a rise in vaccine hesitancy, and growing distrust of public health agencies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm particularly concerned about the accessibility of vaccines for vulnerable populations," former U.S. surgeon general Jerome Adams told KFF Health News. Adams served in President Donald Trump's first administration. "Without high vaccination rates, we are setting those populations and communities up for preventable harm."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services, which houses the CDC, does not comment on ongoing litigation, spokesperson Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano said. But she sent a statement on the original action, saying that HHS made the cuts because the COVID pandemic is over: "HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But clinics have also used the money to address other preventable diseases such as flu, mpox, and measles. More than&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt; 500 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; so far in a Texas outbreak have led to 57 hospitalizations and the deaths of two school-age children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Pima County, Arizona, officials learned that one of its vaccination programs would have to end early because the federal government&lt;a href="https://pima.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&amp;amp;ID=13988956&amp;amp;GUID=E544CB0E-E898-4719-A72D-98DB8EB90410" target="_blank"&gt; took away&lt;/a&gt; its remaining $1 million in grant money. The county had to cancel about 20 vaccine events offering COVID and flu shots that it had already scheduled, said Theresa Cullen, director of the county health department. And it isn't able to plan any more, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The county is home to Tucson, the second-largest city in Arizona. But it also has sprawling rural areas, including part of the Tohono O'odham Nation, that are far from many health clinics and pharmacies, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The county used the federal grant to offer free vaccines in mostly rural areas, usually on the weekends or after usual work hours on weekdays, Cullen said. The programs are held at community organizations, during fairs and other events, or inside buses turned into mobile health clinics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Canceling vaccine-related grants has an impact beyond immunization rates, Cullen said. Vaccination events are also a chance to offer health education, connect people with other resources they may need, and build trust between communities and public health systems, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;County leaders knew the funding would run out at the end of June, but Cullen said the health department had been in talks with local communities to find a way to continue the events. Now "We've said, 'Sorry, we had a commitment to you and we're not able to honor it,'" she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cullen said the health department won't restart the events even though a judge temporarily blocked the funding cuts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The vaccine equity grant is a grant that goes from the CDC to the state to us," she said. "The state is who gave us a stop work order."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The full effect of the CDC cuts is not yet clear in many places. California Department of Public Health officials estimated that grant terminations would result in at least $840 million in federal funding losses for its state, including $330 million used for virus monitoring, testing, childhood vaccines, and addressing health disparities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We are working to evaluate the impact of these actions," said California Department of Public Health Director&lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/meet-the-director" target="_blank"&gt; Erica Pan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Washoe County, Nevada, the surprise cuts in federal funding mean the loss of two contract staffers who set up and advertise vaccination events, including&lt;a href="https://dpbh.nv.gov/Programs/Immunization/School_and_Childcare/School_and_Child_Care_Immunizations/" target="_blank"&gt; state-mandated&lt;/a&gt; back-to-school immunizations for illnesses such as measles.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Our core team can't be in two places at once," said&lt;a href="https://www.nnph.org/about-us/leadership-team/lisa-lottritz.php" target="_blank"&gt; Lisa Lottritz&lt;/a&gt;, division director for community and clinical health services at Northern Nevada Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She expected to retain the contractors through June, when the grants were scheduled to sunset. The health district scrambled to find money to keep the two workers for a few more weeks. They found enough to pay them only through May.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lottritz immediately canceled a publicity blitz focused on getting children on government insurance up to date on their shots. Vaccine events at the public health clinic will go on, but are "very scaled back" with fewer staff members, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nurses who offer shots out and about at churches, senior centers, and food banks will stop that work in May, when the money to pay the contract workers runs out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The staff have other responsibilities. They do compliance visits, they're running our clinic, so I won't have the resources to put on events like that," Lottritz said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The effect of the cancellations will reverberate for a long time, said&lt;a href="https://www.nnph.org/about-us/leadership-team/chad-kingsley.php" target="_blank"&gt; Chad Kingsley&lt;/a&gt;, district health officer for Northern Nevada Public Health, and it might take years for the full scope of decreasing vaccinations to be felt.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Our society doesn't have a collective knowledge of those diseases and what they did," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Measles is top of mind in Missouri, where a conference on strengthening immunization efforts statewide was abruptly canceled due to the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Missouri Immunization Coalition, which organized the event for April 24-25, also had to lay off half its staff, according to board president Lynelle Phillips. The coalition, which coordinates immunization advocacy and education across the state, must now find alternative funding to stay open.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's just cruel and unthinkably wrong to do this in the midst of a measles resurgence in the country," Phillips said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Dana Eby, of the health department in New Madrid County, Missouri, had planned to share tips about building trust for vaccines in rural communities at the conference, including using school nurses and the&lt;a href="https://health.mo.gov/living/wellness/immunizations/vfc-providers.php" target="_blank"&gt; Vaccines for Children program&lt;/a&gt;, funded by the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;New Madrid has one of the highest childhood vaccination rates in the state, despite being part of the largely rural "Bootheel" region that is often noted for its poor health outcomes. Over 98% of kindergartners in the county received the vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella in 2023-24, compared with the statewide average of about 91%, and rates as low as 61% in some other Missouri counties.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I will say I think measles will be a problem before I retire," Eby, 42, said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Also slated to speak at the Missouri event was former surgeon general Adams, who said he had planned to emphasize the need for community collaboration and the importance of vaccinations in protecting public health and reducing preventable diseases. He said the timing was especially pertinent given the explosion in measles cases in Texas and the rise in whooping cough cases and&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/02/health/whooping-cough-pertussis-louisiana/index.html" target="_blank"&gt; deaths in Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We can't make America healthy again by going backwards on our historically high U.S. vaccination rates," Adams said. "You can't die from chronic diseases when you're 50 if you've already died from measles or polio or whooping cough when you're 5."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;California correspondent Christine Mai-Duc contributed to this article.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt; KFF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;— the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The result? Pseudoscience that’s &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/opinion/second-opinions/113630?trw=no" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;not just harming human health&lt;/a&gt;. It’s killing animals, too, specifically via H5N1 bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Holistic pet health influencers, organic farmers, and alternative medicine advocates embrace behaviors that increase the risk of viral transmission, paving the way for a potential human pandemic. It’s already killed pets. And now, with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s virtual erasure of the FDA’s &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-lays-off-bird-flu-leadership-among-steep-cuts-to-senior-veterinarians/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Center for Veterinary Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, the very department tasked with overseeing, monitoring, and responding to the ongoing H5N1 outbreak, it will most certainly worsen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wellness misinformation isn’t just rampant in human health — it’s deeply embedded in veterinary health, too. And there are even fewer guardrails in place to combat it than there are in human medicine. The veterinary wellness industry is growing rapidly, with raw pet food alone estimated to double its global market value from $7.39 billion in 2024 to &lt;a href="https://www.maximizemarketresearch.com/market-report/global-raw-pet-food-market/108810" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;$14.5 billion by 2030&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years, the &lt;a href="https://news.immunologic.org/p/the-death-of-a-domestic-cat-from" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;raw pet food industry&lt;/a&gt; has capitalized on the same anti-science rhetoric that fuels vaccine denial and chemophobia. They claim raw diets are “ancestral” and “biologically appropriate,” despite overwhelming veterinary and epidemiological data showing that raw diets increase the risk of bacterial and viral infections — without offering any health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And those infections can include H5N1. The highly pathogenic avian influenza has long been deadly for birds. In the past two years, it has spread into other species: seals, foxes, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/04/h5n1-avian-flu-cats-transmission-pets-companion-animals-disease-surveillance/"&gt;cats&lt;/a&gt;, cows, and more. The more this virus moves through mammals, the more chances there are to mutate, adapt, and potentially jump to humans.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;H5N1 has been detected in poultry, dairy cattle, and raw milk, which means pet food made from these sources and left uncooked can carry live H5N1 virus, along with a myriad of other pathogens and parasites. Yet pet food companies continue to mislead pet owners into thinking raw diets are safe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cats are particularly susceptible to infection with H5N1 through ingestion too, as their gastrointestinal tracts contain high levels of the receptors that H5N1 binds (α2,3-linked sialic acid receptors). In 2024, indoor pet cats in California died after being &lt;a href="https://main.sbcounty.gov/2025/01/15/h5n1-detected-in-cat-after-consuming-recalled-raw-milk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;fed&lt;/a&gt; raw pet food infected with H5N1. Other pet cats died after eating &lt;a href="https://apps.oregon.gov/oregon-newsroom/OR/ODA/Posts/Post/morasch-meats-voluntary-recall-feline-raw-pet-food-hpai" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;raw poultry products&lt;/a&gt; contaminated with H5N1, sold by a pet food company. The H5N1 &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/news/cat-deaths-linked-bird-flu-contaminated-raw-pet-food-sparking-voluntary-recall#:~:text=sparking%20voluntary%20recall-,Cat%20deaths%20linked%20to%20bird%20flu%2Dcontaminated,pet%20food%2C%20sparking%20voluntary%20recall&amp;amp;text=Since%20the%20U.S.%20outbreak%20of,were%20contaminated%20with%20the%20virus." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;mortality rates&lt;/a&gt; in infected cats can be upward of 50%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet instead of deferring to &lt;a href="https://www.oregonvma.org/news/highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-hpai" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;veterinary&lt;/a&gt;, scientific, and public health experts, wellness influencers are pushing anti-science attitudes and misinformation that accelerates the virus’s spread. Cooking meat and pasteurizing dairy effectively inactivate influenza viruses, but raw foods allow virus to survive and spread through the food supply, pet and human alike. Contrary to claims of wellness influencers, the alternative preservation methods they tout, like high pressure processing (HPP) and &lt;a href="https://www3.paho.org/hq/images/stories/AD/HSD/CD/INFLUENZA/no_07_ai_nov05_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;freezing&lt;/a&gt;, do not render flu viruses inert. Holistic pet influencers push “natural immunity” to H5N1 and “cures” that don’t work. And organic farming groups resist culling of infected flocks and &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/the-monitor/skepticism-about-vaccines-and-response-to-bird-flu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reject livestock vaccination&lt;/a&gt; programs, allowing the virus to spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Does this sound familiar? It’s the same anti-vaccine, anti-public health mindset that fueled Covid-19 misinformation, that’s currently fueling measles misinformation — and with this, it’s also enabling a virus with known pandemic potential.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just an animal health crisis — it’s a risk to public health. When animals consume foods containing live virus, they can get infected but also shed virus into the environment, which allows H5N1 to survive, spread, and replicate among more animals — potentially making the jump to humans easier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Influenza A viruses like H5N1 have segmented genomes, which means they can exchange entire pieces of their genetic material within a host and become an entirely new virus. Every time H5N1 infects a new species, there’s a potential opportunity to mutate into a strain that can spread to humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just theoretical. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic occurred when a new influenza virus jumped species.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The wellness industry doesn’t spread misinformation by accident — it’s their business model. It convinces people that “mainstream” medicine, veterinary science, and public health experts are untrustworthy. It manufactures fear of “toxins,” “Big Pharma,” and “Big Pet Food,” then sells alternative solutions — raw diets, homeopathic remedies, and “natural” immune boosters — that have no scientific basis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The claims aren’t supported by data. There is no evidence that raw diets provide health benefits to pets — but overwhelming evidence that they increase the risk of infections and illness. There is no evidence that “natural immunity” can protect against H5N1 — but plenty of evidence that the virus has a 50% mortality rate in infected cats. There is no evidence that raw milk is superior to pasteurized milk — but abundant evidence that raw dairy spreads deadly pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can’t allow pseudoscience to dictate pet health and public health policy. We need to focus on evidence-based disease control at a time when the health of humans, our pets, and the planet are threatened. That means more regulatory oversight, policies that control zoonotic diseases, and infrastructure for disease control. Kennedy’s dismantling of critical health agency departments is the opposite of what is needed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine monitors zoonotic diseases like H5N1, regulates pet food safety, and responds to veterinary public health crises, but it was hit hard by recent layoffs. That needs to be reversed. In addition to fully staffing the center, we need laws and oversight on raw pet food manufacturing and distribution. That includes mandatory pathogen testing, clear labeling, and enforceable safety standards to prevent the spread of infectious diseases through the pet food supply chain. We need science-driven animal health policies, including vaccination of domestic poultry and other animals, and culling protocols to prevent unchecked spread of H5N1. These are the proven interventions to contain H5N1 prevent cross-species transmission, and reduce the risk of a human pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RFK Jr.’s proposal of letting H5N1 spread unchecked through birds will have the opposite effect. Pasteurization requirements and food safety laws must be strengthened — raw milk and dairy is a known vector for many viral and bacterial pathogens, including H5N1. We need to expand food inspection budgets, not cut them. We need accurate public health communication at the national and state level to combat pseudoscience and food safety misinformation at a time when social media influencers are allowed to say anything without any repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The real threat isn’t just the virus, it’s the anti-science movement enabling its spread. We’ve repeatedly seen how pseudoscience kills through history. The only question now isn’t &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the wellness industry will help fuel the next pandemic — it’s &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt;. And with RFK Jr. gutting our critical science and health agencies, that “when” may come a lot sooner than we think.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andrea Love, Ph.D., is an immunologist and microbiologist who works full-time in life sciences biotech and founded ImmunoLogic, a science communication and consulting organization, to help combat health disinformation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

By bringing together the latest evidence-based recommendations, the guidelines provide a critical tool for reducing deaths and disability caused by the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite effective treatments and vaccines against some forms of meningitis, the disease remains a significant global health threat. Bacterial meningitis is the most dangerous form and can become fatal within 24 hours. Many pathogens can cause meningitis with an estimated 2.5 million cases reported globally in 2019. This includes 1.6 million cases of bacterial meningitis which resulted in approximately 240 000 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 20% of people who contract bacterial meningitis develop long-term complications, including disabilities that impact quality of life. The disease also carries heavy financial and social costs for individuals, families, and communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bacterial meningitis kills one in six of the people it strikes, and leaves many others with lasting health challenges," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. "Implementing these new guidelines will help save lives, improve long-term care for those affected by meningitis, and strengthen health systems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meningitis can affect anyone anywhere, and at any age, however the disease burden remains particularly high in low- and middle-income countries and in settings experiencing large-scale epidemics.  The highest burden of disease is seen in a region of sub-Saharan Africa, often referred to as the ‘meningitis belt’, which is at high risk of recurrent epidemics of meningococcal meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recommendations for the clinical management of meningitis in children and adults&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improving clinical management of meningitis is essential to reducing mortality and morbidity, minimizing long-term complications and disability, and improving quality of life for affected individuals and communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the clinical management of children over one month of age, adolescents, and adults with acute community-acquired meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They address all aspects of clinical care, including diagnosis, antibiotic therapy, adjunctive treatment, supportive care, and management of long-term effects.  Given the similarities in clinical presentation, diagnosis and management approaches across different forms of acute community-acquired meningitis, the guidelines address both bacterial and viral causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines provide recommendations for both non-epidemic and epidemic settings, the latter superseding previous 2014 WHO guidelines, which covered    &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/WHO-HSE-PED-CED-14.5"&gt;meningitis outbreak response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As resource-limited settings bear the highest burden of meningitis, these guidelines have been specifically developed to provide technical guidance suitable for implementation in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines are intended for use by health-care professionals in first- and second-level facilities, including emergency, inpatient, and outpatient services. Policymakers, health planners, academic institutions, and civil society organizations can also use them to inform capacity-building, education, and research efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Defeating meningitis by 2030&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines contribute to the broader   &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/9789240026407"&gt;Defeating Meningitis by 2030&lt;/a&gt; Global Roadmap, adopted by WHO Member States in 2020, which aims to: eliminate bacterial meningitis epidemics, reduce cases of vaccine-preventable bacterial meningitis by 50% and deaths by 70%, and reduce disability and improve quality of life after meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Achieving these goals requires coordinated action across five key areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnosis and treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;Faster detection and optimal clinical management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention and epidemic control&lt;/strong&gt;: Developing new affordable vaccines, achieving high immunization and coverage, and improving outbreak preparedness and response.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disease surveillance: &lt;/strong&gt;Strengthening monitoring systems to guide prevention and control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Care and support for those affected by meningitis: &lt;/strong&gt;Ensuring early recognition and improved access to care and support for after-effects from meningitis. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advocacy and engagement: &lt;/strong&gt;Increasing political commitment and inclusion in country plans, better public understanding of meningitis, and increased awareness of right to prevention, care and after-care services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these guidelines, WHO provides countries with a critical tool to close gaps in meningitis diagnosis, treatment and care, ensuring that more people receive timely treatment and long-term support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

My team is working to uncover some of the mechanisms behind how alcohol increases cancer risk, including damage to immune cells and the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold health-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;How does alcohol cause cancer? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer occurs when cells grow uncontrollably in the body. Alcohol may lead to tumor formation by damaging DNA, causing mutations that disrupt normal cell division and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have identified several mechanisms associated with alcohol and cancer development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The surgeon general report highlights four ways alcohol can cause cancer: alcohol metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation, alterations in hormone levels, and interactions with other carcinogens such as tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol metabolism is the process by which the body breaks down and eliminates alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When alcohol breaks down, its first byproduct is acetaldehyde, a chemical that is itself classified as a carcinogen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have found certain genetic mutations can lead the body to break down alcohol faster, resulting in increased levels of acetaldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is also considerable evidence that alcohol can trigger the body to release harmful molecules called free radicals  that are associated with cell damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They damage DNA in a process called oxidative stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;My lab has found that free radicals formed from alcohol consumption can directly affect how well cells make and break down proteins, resulting in abnormal proteins that promote inflammation and favors tumor formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol can also affect hormone levels in ways that increase cancer risk. Moderate alcohol drinking can elevate estrogen levels, which can increase breast cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The substance also amplifies breast cancer risk by reducing levels of vitamin A, a compound that regulates estrogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, people who both drink and smoke have an elevated risk of developing cancer of the mouth, pharynx and larynx. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smoking by itself can cause inflammation and induce free radicals that damage DNA, and alcohol makes it easier for the body to absorb the carcinogens in cigarettes and vapes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;How much alcohol is safe? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You may be wondering how much alcohol you can safely drink and avoid harm. If you ask clinicians and scientists, you might not like the answer: none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC and American dietary guidelines recommend consuming no more than one drink a day for women and no more than two drinks for men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the surgeon general’s recent advisory have similar recommendations to limit alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol consumption is a highly preventable cause of cancer. However, there isn’t currently a way to determine someone’s personal cancer risk from alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each person’s individual genetic background, lifestyle, diet and other health factors can all influence the effects of alcohol on tumor formation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nevertheless, rethinking your alcohol drinking habits can help protect your health and reduce your cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;This article is adapted from The Conversation, a nonprofit news organization dedicated to sharing the knowledge of experts.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He continued: 'It goes against Big Pharma and it goes against traditional medicine. It is a tragedy because these are very effective therapies that can really improve the patient's outcome.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marik, however, did not discourage standard treatments and said 'some of these [treatments] can be used in conjunction with standard chemotherapy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A month's worth of vitamin D supplements, depending on the dosage, can range from around $5 to $25 while omega-3 capsules cost about $20 to $40. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin D is also naturally found in fatty fish like salmon and sardines, egg yolks, and fortified dairy, while fatty fish, edadame, and nuts all contain omega-3s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other hand, a month's worth of chemotherapy drugs can range dramatically in price - from $1,000 to more than $12,000, depending on the type and insurance coverage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, once someone is diagnosed with cancer, there is little evidence that supplements alone can help and traditional pharmaceutical therapies are lifesaving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the US oncology market reached $145.5 billion last year and is projected for a significant increase to $417 billion by 2034. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Factors such as a rising prevalence of cancer, advancements in precision medicine and increased demand for targeted therapies and immunotherapies are expected to boost the market in the next decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;American pharmaceutical company Merck &amp;amp; Co.'s earned about $64.2 billion last year - majorly through sales of chemotherapy drug Keytruda&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Analysis of blood samples revealed that during this time, omega-3 consumption 'turned back the clock' on biological age by up to four months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;American pharmaceutical company Merck &amp;amp; Co.'s earned about $64.2 billion - majorly through sales of Keytruda, a chemotherapy treatment for various cancers like melanoma, lung cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their oncology division made about $2 billion in sales last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Pfizer brought in $64 billion last year which included sales of Xtandi - an oral medication used to treat certain types of advanced prostate cancer.

                                        &lt;p&gt;A TikTok user is sharing her harrowing experience with an unusually prolonged menstrual cycle that has lasted over 1,000 days. Despite consulting doctors, the cause of her condition remained a mystery until recently, when she finally discovered the underlying reason. "It was picked up on the very first ultrasound I had, and no one thought to mention it to me," Poppy revealed in a recent video.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menstrual cycles typically follow a predictable pattern, but variations are common. For most women, menstrual bleeding occurs every 21 to 35 days and lasts between 2 to 7 days. However, this timeline can vary depending on factors such as age, hormones, birth control, and lifestyle factors like stress, diet, and exercise. According to the &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/abnormal-uterine-bleeding?utm_source=redirect&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=otn"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt;, 14% to 25% of US women of childbearing age experience irregular periods, characterised by irregular cycle length, flow, or frequency. While this is usually not a major concern, if irregular periods become persistent or are accompanied by symptoms like pelvic pain or heavy bleeding, it's best to consult a doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="v-ndtv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poppy's three-year period saga began with two weeks of continuous bleeding, prompting medical attention. Despite multiple doctor consultations, tests, and medication, the bleeding persisted. Cysts were discovered on her ovaries, but the cause remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My iron levels? Rock bottom. The cramps? Awful. All of my muscles hurt, my bones hurt. I have constant headaches, constant nausea," Poppy said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poppy's periods persisted for three months, despite a PCOS diagnosis. Doctors performed a hysteroscopy, but found no clear cause. A specialist prescribed new medication and inserted an IUD, which also failed to provide relief. Her frustration and desperation grew as she struggled with persistent bleeding for over a year, despite undergoing numerous tests and trying various treatments and medications. Even an MRI and ultrasound showed no underlying issues. The cycle of hope and disappointment took a toll on her mental health, plunging her into depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her breakthrough came on day 950 of her prolonged bleeding, when she discovered a possible cause with the help of her TikTok followers. She revealed that she has a rare condition called a bicornuate uterus, also known as a heart-shaped uterus, where the uterus is divided into two chambers instead of one. Interestingly, this detail was initially noted on her first ultrasound around the third or fourth month of bleeding, but its significance wasn't realised until much later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bicornuate uterus, a rare condition affecting less than 5% of women, can cause severe symptoms such as heavy and prolonged bleeding, painful periods, and pelvic discomfort. While many women with this condition remain asymptomatic, for those who experience symptoms, the impact can be significant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have spent 950 days in absolute agony, spending my lifetime f—king savings on period pads and period products, on new trousers, on new underwear, on new sheets. I have cried every single day," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find relief, Poppy is planning to undergo several procedures. She will have a comprehensive hormonal panel to test her hormone levels and have her IUD removed. She is also scheduled for a dilation and curettage procedure, where doctors will scrape away abnormal tissue from her uterine lining.

And if you’re looking for a late-night snack to help you wind down from all the stress of the day, these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/apple-peanut-butter-energy-balls-8364376" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Apple &amp;amp; Peanut Butter Energy Balls&lt;/a&gt; are the perfect option. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Anxiety can affect nutrition in several ways,” says &lt;a href="https://tobyamidornutrition.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Toby Amidor, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian. She notes that there’s research showing that certain nutrients, either when taken in excess or when lacking, may increase anxiety. Getting sufficient nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium and probiotics, as well as eating more fruits and veggies, is associated with reduced anxiety.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; On the other hand, a high intake of added sugar may increase the risk of anxiety disorders.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Enjoying this late-night snack is a great way for you to add essential nutrients that can help manage anxiety. Plus, it satisfies a sweet tooth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-makes-our-apple--peanut-butter-energy-balls-a-great-option"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Makes Our Apple &amp;amp; Peanut Butter Energy Balls a Great Option &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Contain Magnesium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Peanut butter is a good source of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-8656021" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, a mineral that plays a role in various bodily processes, from muscle function to energy production. One serving of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-peanut-butter-good-for-you-8638482" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;peanut butter&lt;/a&gt; (2 tablespoons) has approximately 12% of the recommended daily magnesium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This essential micronutrient is also important for managing anxiety, due to its effects on some neurotransmitters. “Magnesium enhances the activity of GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter that quiets the brain, while simultaneously reducing activity of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter which can contribute to anxiety when elevated,” says &lt;a href="https://www.focusednutritionandwellness.com/aboutme" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dani Felber, M.S., RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, a mental health registered dietitian.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Unfortunately, states of chronic stress increase the excretion of magnesium through the urine. “This creates a vicious cycle in which the resulting magnesium deficiency exacerbates stress and anxiety, further depleting magnesium stores,” says Felber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium is a frequently under-consumed nutrient in the United States, with many people failing to meet the recommended Daily Value for magnesium of 420 milligrams for adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; An easy way to up your daily intake is by munching on these energy balls.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Provide Tryptophan &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tryptophan is an essential amino acid, meaning you need to obtain it through food. One of the most well-known sources of tryptophan is turkey. Still, you can also get it from a variety of other foods, including cheese and dark chocolate, as well as oats and peanuts (two ingredients of these energy balls). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tryptophan plays a role in managing anxiety as a precursor for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-serotonin-snacks-to-sleep-better-11697639" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;serotonin&lt;/a&gt;, a neurotransmitter. Serotonin is not just essential for mood regulation; it also influences gastrointestinal and cardiovascular function as well as many aspects of the central nervous system.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Felber emphasizes that tryptophan alone won’t boost serotonin levels in the brain, as it competes with other amino acids to cross the blood-brain barrier. “The key is combining high-tryptophan foods with a carbohydrate source,” she says. “The insulin released when you eat carbohydrates directs some of those competing amino acids to other parts of the body, allowing more tryptophan to enter the brain where it’s converted into serotonin.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Eating a combination of foods with tryptophan and carbohydrates, like apples with peanut butter, can help increase the amount of tryptophan that crosses the blood-brain barrier.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to note that many medications used for treating anxiety and depression also target serotonin. So if you’re taking this type of medication, or even if you aren’t, consult your primary health care provider on the best diet modifications to support your brain health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Made with Produce &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating fruits and vegetables as part of a healthy diet pattern is associated with reduced anxiety levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And one of the easiest ways to increase your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8004966/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-enough-fruits-vegetables/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fruit and veggie intake&lt;/a&gt; is to prep yummy recipes that encourage eating them. These energy balls only require 15 minutes of active time, and you can refrigerate them for up to one week. So you’ll always have something on hand in the evenings. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-a-late-night-snack-to-help-reduce-anxiety"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look For in a Late-Night Snack to Help Reduce Anxiety &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balanced with protein, carbohydrates and healthy fat&lt;/strong&gt;: You may be used to shunning carbohydrates in a late-night snack, but Felber encourages carbs when managing anxiety. This is especially true when aiming to increase the tryptophan in your diet to boost serotonin production. “By pairing carbohydrates with tryptophan-rich foods (which tend to be high in protein, fat and fiber), you’ll encourage your brain to produce more serotonin, while maintaining stable blood sugar levels,” she says. Additionally, foods rich in protein and healthy fats slow down digestion, helping you feel satisfied.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low in added sugar&lt;/strong&gt;: Cutting back on added sugar can be beneficial for your health and may even help with anxiety management. Amidor points to a 2024 review that suggests there might be a possible link between high added sugar and anxiety.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, she notes that more research is needed to understand if there’s an association. Still, you can benefit from consuming less added sugar, since this helps reduce your risk of chronic diseases. And eating foods that are naturally sweet, like fruits, is a great way to achieve that while still getting a sweet bite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy to prepare:&lt;/strong&gt; When you’re anxious, even small tasks like preparing a meal can feel overwhelming. Quick and easy snacks are a go-to when anxiety is at its peak. Look for pre-prepped fruits and vegetables, if they fit your budget. Other convenient foods that require minimal prep, like hard-boiled eggs, cheese sticks, trail mix and hummus, can be good choices when you need a quick and easy snack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While managing anxiety requires a whole-body approach guided by health professionals, research has shown that certain nutrients can make a positive impact. Higher intake of nutrients such as omega-3s, probiotics, magnesium, fruits and veggies is associated with lower anxiety levels. So, make a batch of these energy balls to enjoy while winding down late at night.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Kennedy Jr., the nation’s health secretary, recommended the measles vaccine and said he was “not familiar” with sweeping cuts to state and local public health programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The conversation was taped shortly after his visit to West Texas, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/health/measles-death-texas.html" title=""&gt;where he attended the funeral&lt;/a&gt; of an 8-year-old girl who died after contracting measles. A raging outbreak there has sickened more than 500 people and killed two young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In clips of the discussion released Wednesday, Mr. Kennedy offered one of his strongest endorsements yet of the measles vaccine. “People should get the measles vaccine, but the government should not be mandating those,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;A few moments later, however, he raised safety concerns about the shot, as he has previously: “We don’t know the risks of many of these products because they’re not safety tested,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;For months, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/health/measles-vaccination-texas-kennedy.html" title=""&gt;Mr. Kennedy has faced intense criticism&lt;/a&gt; for his handling of the West Texas outbreak from medical experts who believe that his failure to offer a full-throated endorsement of immunization has hampered efforts to contain the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Moreover, he has promoted unproven treatments for measles, like cod liver oil. Doctors in Texas believe its use is tied to signs &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/health/measles-kennedy-vitamin-a.html" title=""&gt;of liver toxicity&lt;/a&gt; in some children arriving in local hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Throughout the outbreak, Mr. Kennedy has often paired support for vaccines with discussions of safety concerns about the shots, along with “miraculous” alternative treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Over the weekend, he posted on social media that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine was “the most effective way” to prevent the spread of measles — a statement met with relief from infectious disease experts and with fury from his vaccine-hesitant base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;That night, he posted again, this time applauding “two extraordinary healers” who he claimed had effectively treated roughly 300 measles-stricken children with budesonide, a steroid, and clarithromycin, an antibiotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-3"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Scientists say there are no cures for a measles infection, and that claiming otherwise undermines the importance of a vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Later in the CBS interview, Mr. Kennedy was pressed on the administration’s recent move &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/health/trump-state-health-grants-cuts.html" title=""&gt;to halt more than $12 billion&lt;/a&gt; in federal grants to state programs that address infectious disease, mental health and childhood vaccinations, among other efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;(&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/politics/hhs-public-health-grants-judge.html" title=""&gt;A judge has temporarily blocked the cuts&lt;/a&gt; after a coalition of states sued the Trump administration.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Kennedy said he wasn’t familiar with the interruptions, then asserted that they were “mainly D.E.I. cuts,” referring &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/dei-diversity-equity-inclusion" title=""&gt;to diversity, equity and inclusion programs that have been targeted&lt;/a&gt; by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Dr. Jonathan LaPook, CBS’s medical correspondent, asked about specific research cuts at universities, including a $750,000 grant to researchers at the University of Michigan to study adolescent diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“I didn’t know that, and that’s something that we’ll look at,” Mr. Kennedy said. “There’s a number of studies that were cut that came to our attention and that did not deserve to be cut, and we reinstated them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 00:46:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNbmZSaC1LMTBKaWU5NThhZDk3MlBOcUtxRG1aeGpoMWdYNkRCUXJzcV9YVlVXMEMzSDNKa1lQaG5FZFZBaWU4ZFh0dE9SQ2gwT1I0RjlVTTVGclY1a0tyTjZQVkVLMFcxT0hiQUFRS2UxdUdFV1BmaURyX1ctMm5DY3J6YmJoa1dKZVJ6ZnNmcWstV19WNnRFNVhjS2hIUV9qLWcwUm13</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr. praises measles response in Texas, US by making comparison to Europe - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOQ3l4QnVOdGFUTjZBRlhHMlhGUTZDMmtGOFNXUUlKbjFpNmJvOEJKbDBaSW1ubXBqX3hRRkZBaGZsZFVRbVJDYTFUUEF6UVZSclVISDNwSzFhdE9yT29jSEZXSUp4MDZYYkFadXVwVnFkYUtwNVJmWE1lZUZRTjJjNm9icmZtNHBjZ1FYVHV5cDBLR0U2RmwwdkZrZWPSAaIBQVVfeXFMTmFtS0pROHRnVU9fZXk1V3N1RDJDY2IwcXVCelREQnY4YkRTTnhwZ1BNLTVEc3RXOVdNenR6cTIwVlpuTzloUnlsanpTUkRYT2hZV3l4aHNMZzJFcVR5TDNta2ZCYWFPc3AxZ3hRMjdvQzJHbGdWdkhyY2htcHlQMkZuckR1czNlenlGZ29sY2dIMTl3SDB6SlVGY1ZTNXJaQk5R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;On Tuesday at a press conference, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Most notably, they had a 133% higher chance to develop a brain lesion than non-drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk wasn't isolated to the heavy drinkers alone, however, as former heavy drinkers still had an 89% higher risk, while moderate drinkers had a 60% higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think these are compelling results that link heavy alcohol consumption with lasting impacts on the brain," said Dr. Leana Wen, &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;'s wellness expert, previous Baltimore health commissioner, and emergency physician. "It’s especially telling that former heavy drinkers have evidence of sustained damage, although halting that heavy drinking does appear to lower risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the alarming discovery, Wen said that the severity of the study should still be taken in proportion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are caveats to this study," Wen said. "It is important to point out that these findings are associations that are suggestive, rather than proof of cause and effect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WKRC</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 23:11:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi5wJBVV95cUxNeWlwVHFuOWZNeC1ZbjY5clE2QnpHYzk5OWM0LTlONTNzQXh3ZmxUMmxXM2FrcWNsQm4zbHJuRFN1N3ZPUktPTlBtcE5wM1FvMlNXZWljU1dQVHlJOHF2Vy1obHpNaHVZY1FRbnJZLVIyaWxKazRrajhRYUxSUmx1ZGpuMmxvbDhRR1VRemEyZWR6UDhnY1lCOVdFNU16VzlSVHdwQVhoZ3NUdmQxb0RlYzVMSE9QMW5RS3Y1ZGVkMDBCQ3FPX2owbHpGRzRGZlZib0tHeDRLUGRUVXc4bnZMMmM1STlrdEJmcWVSa2M1S2ZOaDF1Y1hkN0w1bXNqdl9HaUtzTGtFY0k2aUtQelpVbUc4Vnl0Ym42X0tvbVVvSUt6dXRqOFozYnFpNnJTUmtBdlhHMV9iTHdrX0JVVmRiZHllY0xTYkh3QW1aT1dUUG90alFhOHl6UDJuQkh4bW9kTl9aVmJqdw</guid></item><item><title>Diabetes-dementia link, plus new antibiotics discovery - Fox News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxQamVhblFJaDkxdk5tY01LZzNkcWZMVTJGR0UzTXpQc05iQzJMSW9MeVFfN1NXcmdQbEptMktBb2p6TlRFNkY5RDhpQTVpVnU1aERXdzg4SDV6VVVSTkszdmlwUUxaVEhwc3dXdUZyNWExSWhOTFcwSThWdzdlWEp1S1VUdUVQZ9IBiwFBVV95cUxOVnY5bkkxQU1SbkJXdVhUUzVuY3ZxcVRaR3FIeGlHVlJuYzZsR2xmOEFLbktvN3hWazlEWTVKb2VKcjkxUXZrUk94N1ZzOVRxSFFuQ0lRUTJRN0JMcTJqc2JqWmFQZUxNQTExS2hmYjFEb2tUSkQybDVGNUpJSHYwbFlPd0J0R2NESzhz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fox News</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 23:10:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQamVhblFJaDkxdk5tY01LZzNkcWZMVTJGR0UzTXpQc05iQzJMSW9MeVFfN1NXcmdQbEptMktBb2p6TlRFNkY5RDhpQTVpVnU1aERXdzg4SDV6VVVSTkszdmlwUUxaVEhwc3dXdUZyNWExSWhOTFcwSThWdzdlWEp1S1VUdUVQZ9IBiwFBVV95cUxOVnY5bkkxQU1SbkJXdVhUUzVuY3ZxcVRaR3FIeGlHVlJuYzZsR2xmOEFLbktvN3hWazlEWTVKb2VKcjkxUXZrUk94N1ZzOVRxSFFuQ0lRUTJRN0JMcTJqc2JqWmFQZUxNQTExS2hmYjFEb2tUSkQybDVGNUpJSHYwbFlPd0J0R2NESzhz</guid></item><item><title>Europe's population is adapting better to cold than to heat, study shows - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE5QZk9Mdm9DX2FrOW1YWnZFM0hjMXBFVGgySWZvRXRSS05KX0pQODdMNmNzSmNXUHVtclZhZnJnazZDYmxXR2JCMFctVGZHMjQ0X2hHVWZDb2NyZ05wY3RMUlY5U2RIaG80YThuQWxDbTA5dzZo?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) has shown that Europe has adapted better to low temperatures than to high temperatures over the last two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

There has also been a reduction in the risk of heat-related deaths over this period, although to a lesser extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By analyzing temperature and mortality records from over 800 regions in 35 European countries for the period 2003-2020, the researchers found that the relative risk of death at the lowest temperatures fell by 2% per year. On the other hand, the relative risk of death at the highest temperatures also decreased, but at a lower average rate of 1% per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New approach to account for regional differences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, studies of this type have relied on fixed temperature thresholds to calculate risks, without taking into account that the vulnerability to identical temperatures is not the same in all parts of Europe. To overcome this limitation, the team developed a new concept: Extreme-Risk Temperature (ERT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By cross-referencing regional temperature and mortality data, this new approach made it possible to calculate the temperature at which the risk of death exceeds a certain threshold for each geographical area. The researchers also took into account variations in mortality to reflect adaptations to temperature over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this methodology, the team observed that in the period 2003–2020, Europe experienced 2.07 less dangerously cold days (cold-ERT days) each year. On the contrary, the dangerously hot days (heat-ERT days) increased by 0.28 days per year.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, not all parts of Europe were affected the same way. For example, Southeastern European regions, despite their warmer conditions, had more dangerous heat and cold days that caused a higher risk of associated mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have become better at coping with cold temperatures over time—a process known in science as 'adaptation.' For hot weather, people are also becoming resilient, though this improvement is less than the adaptation to cold," says Zhao-Yue Chen, ISGlobal researcher and first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The vulnerability to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/extreme+temperatures/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;extreme temperatures&lt;/a&gt; varies widely across different locations, with regions in Southern Europe being more sensitive to temperature changes than those in Northern Europe. This disparity is partially due to socioeconomic factors, including inadequate housing insulation, lower public health expenditure and limited access to social support or assistance for vulnerable populations," Zhao-Yue Chen adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our results show that, while Europe has made remarkable progress in adapting to cold, the strategies to cope with heat-related mortality have been less effective," says Joan Ballester Claramunt, ISGlobal researcher and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A 2024 survey revealed that only 20 out of 38 European countries have implemented temperature surveillance systems, and 17 countries still do not have heat-health action plans (HHAPs). Our study highlights the need for more progress in current heat adaptation measures and heat-health action plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At the same time, the observed spatial disparities underscore the need for region-specific strategies to protect vulnerable populations."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Combined effects of temperature and air pollution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also looked at how often Extreme-Risk Temperatures happened on days with pollution levels above the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended limits. The co-occurrence of these two events, known as "compound days", happened on 60% of heat-ERT days and 65% of cold-ERT days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, these combination days have been decreasing except for the combination of dangerously hot days and high levels of ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) pollution, which increased at a rate of 0.26 days per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ozone is a secondary pollutant formed in the atmosphere as a result of the interaction between other gases and solar radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/global+warming/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt; intensifies, combined heat and ozone episodes are becoming an inevitable and pressing concern for Europe. We need to consider compound days and develop specific strategies to tackle secondary pollutants such as ozone, because the health impacts of extreme temperatures and air pollution are not completely independent. There is an interaction between them that can amplify adverse health effects," says Zhao-Yue Chen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study has been carried out in the context of the &lt;a href="https://www.early-adapt.eu/" target="_blank"&gt;EARLY-ADAPT project&lt;/a&gt; and aimed at studying how populations are adapting to the public health challenges triggered by climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="t-copy has-xxl-vert-marg"&gt;
    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services this week released an updated set of vaccine recommendations for 10 West Texas counties at the center of an ongoing measles outbreak that has so far claimed two children’s lives and infected more than 500 people in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Although 22 Texas counties have reported at least one measles case, the state in recent weeks has been designating counties with the most measles cases as “outbreak areas.” On Monday the outbreak area expanded from six to 10 counties: Cochran, Dallam, Dawson, Gaines, Garza, Lamar, Lynn, Lubbock, Terry and Yoakum.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The recommendations for those living or traveling to the outbreak counties covers Texans of all ages, not just young children. The agency stressed that vaccination is the best defense against measles and that two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella or MMR vaccine prevents more than 97% of measles infections.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Among DSHS’ recommendations for outbreak areas:&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      
&lt;ul class="c-list c-list--indented t-copy"&gt;
  
    &lt;li class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Children 6 to 11 months receive an “outbreak” dose of the MMR vaccine if they live or are traveling to an outbreak county&lt;/li&gt;

  
    &lt;li class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Children over 12 months old who have not been vaccinated with the MMR vaccine receive one dose and follow up with a second at least 28 days later&lt;/li&gt;

  
    &lt;li class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Teens and adults should also be up to date on their MMR vaccination&lt;/li&gt;

  
    &lt;li class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Adults born between 1957 and 1968 who only received one MMR vaccine from that time period should consider getting one dose of the current vaccine&lt;/li&gt;

  
    &lt;li class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Adults born before 1957, pregnant women, and people with severe immunodeficiency are not recommended to receive any dose of MMR vaccine&lt;/li&gt;

  
&lt;/ul&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;More information on outbreak area guidance can be found here.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The guidance was offered in a 30-slide presentation by Dr. Dr. Varun Shetty, DSHS chief epidemiologist, during the state agency’s public health funding and policy committee meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Shetty also stressed that there is no specific antiviral therapy for measles and that “vitamin A is not a preventative treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Vitamin A is not a cure for measles. But for those with severe vitamin A deficiencies it can lessen symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;It’s a therapy long touted by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as a treatment for measles, a claim discounted by physicians because most Americans get enough vitamin A in their regular diet.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Because the public is asking questions about using vitamin A to relieve measles symptoms, the state agency&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/measles/measles-frequently-asked-questions#:~:text=Can%20vitamin%20A%20help%20treat,the%20care%20of%20a%20doctor."&gt; has been recommending&lt;/a&gt; that patients interested in vitamin A consult with their health care provider about it. The state agency also offers this guidance:&lt;/p&gt;

    
      
&lt;ul class="c-list c-list--indented t-copy"&gt;
  
    &lt;li class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Under the supervision of a healthcare provider, vitamin A may be administered to infants and children in the United States with measles as part of supportive management.&lt;/li&gt;

  
    &lt;li class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Also under physician supervision, if vitamin A is recommended, it should be administered immediately after a measles diagnosis and repeated the next day for a total of 2 doses.&lt;/li&gt;

  
&lt;/ul&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The state health agency cautioned that inappropriate dosing can lead to vitamin A toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The recommended age-specific daily doses are of vitamin A, according to DSHS is 50,000 IU for infants younger than 6 months, 100,000 IU for infants 6–11 months and 200,000 IU for children 12 months and older&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The inclusion of vitamin A comes a month after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/vitamin-a-measles-virus-texas-cdc-what-know-rcna194288"&gt;made a similar announcement&lt;/a&gt; on Feb. 28, two days after the first West Texas child died of measles.&lt;/p&gt;

The study followed 243 individuals with a family history of Alzheimer’s over nearly seven years and found that those with affected fathers, especially women, showed greater tau buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, this contradicts previous assumptions that maternal inheritance posed higher risk. These findings may help inform future strategies for personalized prevention and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paternal Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Having a father with Alzheimer’s is associated with greater tau protein spread in the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex Difference:&lt;/strong&gt; Female participants showed more extensive tau buildup than males.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Signs:&lt;/strong&gt; 71 participants developed mild cognitive impairment during the study, a precursor to Alzheimer’s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While some studies have suggested that having a mother with Alzheimer’s disease may put you more at risk of developing the disease, a new study finds that having a father with the disease may be tied to a greater spread of the tau protein in the brain that is a sign of the disease, according to a study published on April 9, 2025, online in &lt;em&gt;Neurology.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study does not prove that having a father with Alzheimer’s results in these brain changes; it only shows an association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108553"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older man and his son." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;During that time, 71 people developed mild cognitive impairment, which is a precursor to Alzheimer’s disease. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that female participants may be more at risk of a heavier buildup of tau protein than male participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to see that people with a father with Alzheimer’s were more vulnerable to the spread of tau in the brain, as we had hypothesized that we would see more brain changes in people with affected mothers,” said study author Sylvia Villeneuve, PhD, of McGill University in Montreal, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study looked at 243 people who had a family history of Alzheimer’s disease but had no thinking or memory problems themselves at the average age of 68. Family history was defined as one or both parents with the disease or at least two siblings with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants had brain scans and took tests of thinking and memory skills at the start of the study and then during the study as they were followed for an average of nearly seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that time, 71 people developed mild cognitive impairment, which is a precursor to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that people with a father with Alzheimer’s disease as well as female participants had a greater spread of tau protein in the brain. Female participants also had a heavier buildup of tau protein in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Better understanding these vulnerabilities could help us design personalized interventions to help protect against Alzheimer’s disease,” Villeneuve said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the study is that white people made up the majority of participants, so the results may not apply to other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Quebec Research Fund – Health, J.-Louis Lévesque Foundation, Brain Canada Foundation, Alzheimer’s Society Canada and Brain Canada Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#553b363a3b2734311534343b7b363a38" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Natalie Conrad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aan.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Natalie Conrad – AAN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 21:57:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1kVjU4bGhKX0lhMVNGUkYtYTlVNUlvc2ZkNU8yZndob2VFWFpNam42QVBCVER4eTV0YUNCb19JaVRYcnlGai0xcTN4VVVWNjJ5Y0dsdHlheFRzSjZvc3l3b1BhaHU</guid></item><item><title>Illinois unveils online tool showing measles vaccination rates by school - Chicago Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxOVk1SaDFWVldHN3lJR0RsZmhXWHNxVnRMX1ZLbThWc1pyR0d0RkFCS2V3dHRFa3FzRFBjT2ZNa0UtWmlfbTZkOHVkdE5aZDlkVlU3QjdJZkpSRW4xWU9SSllaX3hvcExWcmJCa2JRR2Z1aWZYTXFwZm5vajVFT1lQTmhSdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With measles spreading across the country, the Illinois Department of Public Health unveiled a &lt;a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/prevention-wellness/immunization/coverage-dashboards/measles-outbreak-simulator-dashboard.html"&gt;new online tool&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday that allows people to look up measles vaccination rates and data about the risk of outbreaks at individual schools across the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illinois has not had any reported cases of measles yet this year, but there were 607 reported cases across the country so far this year, as of April 3, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;Texas announced&lt;/a&gt; that a second child with measles had died. In all, three people with measles in the U.S. have died this year, and all three were unvaccinated. Before the recent outbreak, there had not been a measles death in the U.S. for a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our new dashboard provides the public with the ability to review the measles vaccination rates in their child’s school and its risk for an outbreak,” said Dr. Sameer Vohra, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-wQoDAMss" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_wQoDAMss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/prevention-wellness/immunization/coverage-dashboards/measles-outbreak-simulator-dashboard.html"&gt;Measles Outbreak Simulator Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; uses school vaccination data from 2023-2024 to predict, project and estimate the size and spread of a measles outbreak in individual Illinois schools. People looking up schools in Cook County should look under “Suburban-Cook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state health department is encouraging school administrators and staff to use the dashboard to help make decisions related to outbreak prevention and control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vohra urged Illinois residents to make sure they and their family members are up-to-date on their measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two doses of the vaccine are recommended for lifetime protection and are 97% effective against measles, according to the CDC. One dose is 93% effective against the illness. The first dose of the vaccine, or the similar measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox) vaccine is typically is given at age 12 months to 15 months. Children typically receive the second dose between ages 4 to 6.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;more than 20 states&lt;/a&gt; have reported confirmed cases of measles, with the largest outbreak in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neighboring Indiana said Wednesday it has &lt;a href="https://events.in.gov/event/idoh-news-release-indiana-department-of-health-confirms-5-new-measles-cases?utm_campaign=widget&amp;amp;utm_medium=widget&amp;amp;utm_source=State+of+Indiana"&gt;confirmed six cases of measles&lt;/a&gt;, including four minors who were unvaccinated and two adults whose vaccination status was unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vohra said the state health department is working with local public health departments and health care organizations to “prepare for any potential measles cases in Illinois.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illinois has not had a case of measles since an &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/05/30/citys-public-health-department-declares-measle-outbreak-over-according-to-report/"&gt;outbreak in March 2024&lt;/a&gt; in which 67 cases were reported, with most linked to a Chicago shelter for migrants on the Lower West Side where nearly 2,500 people were living in close quarters. That outbreak was the largest in Illinois since 1990, according to the state health department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can check their vaccination status by contacting their health care providers or looking at their medical records. Or they can use the Illinois Department of Public Health’s online portal, &lt;a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/vaxverify.html?utm_source=sfmc&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=CDPH+Encourages+Measles+Vaccination&amp;amp;utm_term=https%3a%2f%2fdph.illinois.gov%2fvaxverify.html&amp;amp;utm_id=1333387&amp;amp;sfmc_id=128588093"&gt;Vax Verify&lt;/a&gt;, to check their immunization status.&lt;/p&gt;

known as screening - have grown louder since Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy announced he had terminal prostate cancer.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Screening has been rejected in the past because using the current test - which looks for levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the blood - &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://view-health-screening-recommendations.service.gov.uk/prostate-cancer/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;risks causing more harm than good&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This saliva test does not look for signs of prostate cancer inside the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Instead it looks for 130 mutations in men's DNA, each of which can increase the risk of prostate cancers developing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In the study, scientists tested men aged 55-69 and calculated their risk. Men in the top 10% of scores were invited for further investigations. This included a biopsy and an MRI scan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-5c9c90b0-0 ggNdZQ"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-8d73edac-0 ezcCTE"&gt;Out of 745 men with a high score, 468 were prepared to have the extra tests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-8d73edac-0 ezcCTE"&gt;187 were found to have prostate cancer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-8d73edac-0 ezcCTE"&gt;103 were higher risk tumours that needed treatment, 74 of these would not have been discovered at this stage with current tests  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"With this test, it could be possible to turn the tide on prostate cancer," said Prof Ros Eeles, from the Institute of Cancer Research, London. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We can identify men at risk of aggressive cancers who need further tests and spare the men who are at lower risk from unnecessary treatments," she added&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Two lives saved'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bbd4/live/c4048680-1560-11f0-8b33-1b3fa22562ab.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bbd4/live/c4048680-1560-11f0-8b33-1b3fa22562ab.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bbd4/live/c4048680-1560-11f0-8b33-1b3fa22562ab.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bbd4/live/c4048680-1560-11f0-8b33-1b3fa22562ab.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bbd4/live/c4048680-1560-11f0-8b33-1b3fa22562ab.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bbd4/live/c4048680-1560-11f0-8b33-1b3fa22562ab.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bbd4/live/c4048680-1560-11f0-8b33-1b3fa22562ab.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bbd4/live/c4048680-1560-11f0-8b33-1b3fa22562ab.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Dheeresh Turnbull Two men in lime green t-shirts and matching baseball caps" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Dheeresh Turnbull&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Dheeresh Turnbull (right) with his brother.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dheeresh Turnbull, who is 71 and from Brighton, took part in the trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He discovered he was in the highest risk category despite having no family history of prostate cancer.

Using functional MRI scans, scientists observed disruptions in the frontal-limbic system and cerebellar cortex, regions involved in executive function and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes intensified and expanded as treatment progressed, suggesting a cumulative impact on brain function. The findings may help explain the cognitive difficulties often experienced during and after chemotherapy, commonly known as “chemo brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Brain Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; Chemotherapy quickly alters brain connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affected Regions:&lt;/strong&gt; Disruptions were found in areas linked to memory and decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progressive Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Connectivity changes worsened and spread over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Wiley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New research published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging&lt;/em&gt; has uncovered changes in brain connectivity during chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study of 55 patients with breast cancer and 38 controls without cancer, investigators conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging scans of participants’ brains over several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108549"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two heads and brains." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These changes got worse and spread more as chemotherapy continued.

Two matched female healthy control (HCs, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 20 and &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 18) groups received the same assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jmri29772-sec-0005-title"&gt;Field Strength/Sequence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;rs-fMRI (gradient-echo EPI) and 3D T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence at 3.0 T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jmri29772-sec-0006-title"&gt;Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain functional networks were analyzed using graph theory approaches. We analyzed changes in brain connectome metrics and explored the relationship between these changes and clinical scales (including emotion and cognitive test).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients were divided into subgroups according to clinical classification, chemotherapy regimen, and menopausal status.

These abnormalities expanded with chemotherapy progression significantly (TP2 vs. TP3). T&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;opological parameters changes were also correlated with clinical scales changes significantly. No differences were found within or between HC groups (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.490–0.989) or BC subgroups (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.053–0.988) at TP1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jmri29772-sec-0009-title"&gt;Data Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAC affects the brain functional connectome of BC patients at TP2, and these changes persist and further intensify at TP3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jmri29772-sec-0110-title"&gt;Level of Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jmri29772-sec-0111-title"&gt;Technical Efficacy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage 5.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 21:04:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1ndG1rbThUU0FEeHBGSnF1aTY2UkY4NXljcjFXRWZWa0hoa1hHT3NkallVLW8zT2RHejZ0NS1NTHN2M0ozR1RmblUtZ0ttbTdQb0syeFdaenIzcHBNREJZODYyYzZ2anFOWHRFNkMtT1VLb1ZYVHc</guid></item><item><title>Five new measles cases confirmed in Indiana - WSBT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixAFBVV95cUxPOXpLMjYzbUZoMl9JY3BMMUV4MkxkQzJ5eDRfZE9JdDA4TjJ4ZWNfelBycGVJR3hXRWVPOU80Rmt4SWw5MzZ6WmxPSG1NUEt2UTQxTlhib1JVX1lfWTZUZmZFMVhKSHJlUVVNUTNqNF9tMHMtOVVodHFrcS1VS3BLNmJ2MHZ6ZTFwaEhEVldCY3VEUndLVmdKRW1HR3JXa1loazZrV0VfT0hKQlRCVXZmdmRxdFpfUU1oVGpKc1lrblpQcGRt?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="index-module_storyColumn__EZ7G" id="js-Story-Content-0"&gt;&lt;p class="StoryTags-module_tagWrapperLine__Jfav"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;ALLEN COUNTY, Ind.

Scientists found that serotonin neurons encode a “prospective code for value,” signaling expectations about upcoming outcomes and how rapidly those expectations are changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This helps the brain assess the value of possible actions in shifting environments, guiding everyday decision-making. The findings challenge long-held assumptions about serotonin and offer a unifying theory relevant to neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, and AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Forecasting:&lt;/strong&gt; Serotonin neurons encode expectations about upcoming rewards and punishments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broad Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; These neurons respond to surprise, pain, and pleasure—depending on expected value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain vs. Machine:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain’s value-signaling system via serotonin differs significantly from artificial systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Ottawa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In our day-to-day lives, we’re constantly making a slew of decisions from immediate matters to prospects on the far horizon. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the evolutionary nuts-and-bolts of how our brains weigh these numerous daily decisions and what role is played by the neurotransmitter serotonin has been shrouded in mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108545"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While the overall picture was extremely puzzling, he says it was then they realized they might be chasing something promising. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study led by an interdisciplinary University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine team delivers fascinating findings on this big topic and potentially unravels a hidden aspect of what our nervous system’s extraordinarily complex serotonin system is really doing inside the enigmatic organ in our skulls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, this study from a highly impactful international collaboration was considered by one of the expert reviewers who evaluated the work to offer “broad implications across neuroscience, psychology, and psychiatry, enhancing our understanding of serotonin’s role in mood regulation, learning, and motivated behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s innovative work merges ideas from reinforcement learning (RL) theory – used in neuroscience to better understand learning, behavior, and decision-making – with recent hard-won insights into the filtering properties of the brain’s dorsal raphe nucleus. That’s a region of the mammalian brainstem rich in serotonin-producing neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serotonin is often painted as the brain’s “pleasure chemical.” Antidepressant drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) famously target the serotonin system as part of a multi-billion-dollar industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, serotonin’s precise role in the nervous system is ambiguous and perplexing: It’s implicated in everything from mood and movement regulation to appetite and sleep-wake cycles. The fact that it’s activated by pain, pleasure and surprise has long been a brain research puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this study, the uOttawa-led researchers put forth a unifying perspective on serotonin they dub a “prospective code for value” – a biological code for how the brain places a value for future rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This code essentially explains why serotonin neurons are activated in the brain in response to both rewards and punishments, with a preference for surprising rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work asks the question: What does serotonin tell the brain? In a nutshell, we find that its message closely matches the expectation of future rewards,” says senior author Dr. Richard Naud, associate professor at the Faculty of Medicine’s Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicineand the uOttawa Department of Physics&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-author Dr. Jean-Claude Béïque, professor in the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, puts the main findings like this: “Your brain needs to compute the expected value of the actions you contemplate and undertake as you interact with a changing world, asking ‘What’s the value of this decision versus that decision in that particular environment?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s a hard problem. So what we think serotonin actually does in the brain is encode the expected value of a particular environment or course of actions in order to ultimately guide everyday decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drs. Béïque and Naud are both members of the uOttawa Brain and Mind Research Institute’s Centre for Neural Dynamics and Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Initial Spark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The germ of the idea began years ago at the uOttawa Faculty of Medicine when first author Emerson Harkin&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; then a PhD student in Dr. Naud’s lab, started to simulate reinforcement-learning models while working on the biophysical properties of serotonin neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Harkin, who finished his PhD work at uOttawa in late 2023 and was awarded his degree in March 2024, says the core idea came “half-serendipitously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After investing a lot of time and effort studying the electrical properties of the brain cells that produce serotonin, he and his uOttawa Faculty of Medicine supervisors started looking closely at findings from other labs that focused on measuring the activity of serotonin neurons in animals experiencing rewards and punishments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the overall picture was extremely puzzling, he says it was then they realized they might be chasing something promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nobody seemed to have considered the possibility that serotonin neurons might be activated by &lt;em&gt;changes&lt;/em&gt; in the animal’s surroundings, like the start of a signal that reward will arrive soon or the end of a punishment,” says Dr. Harkin, referring to lab experiments with mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we looked at these previous results through the lens of what we had seen under our microscopes and with our electrodes, a lot of results that had previously seemed puzzling or contradictory suddenly started to fit together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now in Germany doing a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Dr. Harkin asserts that the findings show a big part of what the serotonin system does is send a “message to the rest of the brain saying: “Here’s our best guess about how good your near future will be, and here’s how quickly that guess is improving.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Naud, a computational neuroscience expert who drilled down on the theory’s deeply complex math, explains the initial idea evolved quite a bit over the last couple of years as the collaborative team finetuned the work with “lots of reading, lots of discussion, lots of thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, the research team aims to study the role of serotonin on behavior to try and figure out what the rest of the brain does with the neurotransmitter’s messages. Dr. Naud says perhaps finding ways of employing reinforcement-learning theory on frameworks can help them do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Dr. Naud, whose neuroscience work often has implications for theories of learning and memory that can inform future developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), believes the team’s study just published in &lt;em&gt;Nature &lt;/em&gt;appears to show how special the nervous system really is&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a way I feel that the team’s findings show that the brain doesn’t work the way machines do. If we perturb the signaling of rewards in the machine it would do many things that the perturbation in brains don’t do,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6515090a020a110d0025100a11110412044b0604" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Paul Logothetis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uottawa.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Paul Logothetis – University of Ottawa&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08731-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A prospective code for value in the serotonin system&lt;/a&gt;” by Richard Naud et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A prospective code for value in the serotonin system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The in vivo responses of dorsal raphe nucleus serotonin neurons to emotionally salient stimuli are a puzzle. Existing theories centring on reward, surprise, salience and uncertainty individually account for some aspects of serotonergic activity but not others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merging ideas from reinforcement learning theory with recent insights into the filtering properties of the dorsal raphe nucleus, here we find a unifying perspective in a prospective code for value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This biological code for near-future reward explains why serotonin neurons are activated by both rewards and punishments, and why these neurons are more strongly activated by surprising rewards but have no such surprise preference for punishments—observations that previous theories have failed to reconcile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, our model quantitatively predicts in vivo population activity better than previous theories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By reconciling previous theories and establishing a precise connection with reinforcement learning, our work represents an important step towards understanding the role of serotonin in learning and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 20:48:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9uQ3hySFpFYWxWUlpOSmlwOGpuaDc2TXRWeEQxNmhiM21RcG85cHRON0JLd2VvOGdlUTVTckVveHQ0SGczNkxFM0Q3dmlNLU1wMXBuenpVMDZ2OGxlaC1LTjNaYlN3NDZlRFVhVGZqT3c0cjQ</guid></item><item><title>Another state reports measles outbreak - OregonLive.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxQMlZ2V1BreVNTRzl0OHE4RGduMjU3SDZhcFJKaXVQOGhMQ2pfeFFIT2xqMndsdnBveXhaZWxfSGY1aEJkVmVVVHVFeG5mVGxBYm5vNFg1bjhOdzRxSEI3djVvZzJlR3k3bWV0RkVmNE5xZzJzWWk5R04tSkFhekt1VWNMRFJYWXRTTEN4b0pn0gGiAUFVX3lxTFBnekNuR3IxUWNqTVJTdUFpT1ZhUGZHY1JtZ2I1NVZXYXFWTHN6dThaaWk2cHkzY1N1R2JDWkxhYVBpVVl3RUJ6Wm9Ea0dwQ2Z3aUlmS0VaQ0V2TFRrVEhUbXp1Y081c1Ryc0l0eWFIMjJFVGZmQ0Fyb2d5c0g2Ty1wLWZLbnh6eXRxa0FJTHplYmRkNGVLV3Fsejc5bWRsUTJfdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4XSVRIHPGRGTNODN37PX5CYHRI"&gt;Indiana health officials announced a measles outbreak Wednesday, with six cases that have no known links to the outbreaks in several other states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QRZCHGXUTJDNJASDE6X3KA5ELI"&gt;The U.S. has more than double the number of measles cases it saw in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZET2XPAZTNEWRCVQBNAQQUSWGY"&gt;Texas is reporting the majority of them with 505.

His private comments, however, betray his &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/rfk-jr-poppers-hiv-prevention" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;conspiratorial leanings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the funeral for eight-year-old Daisy Hildebrand — the &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/06/measles-texas-outbreak-death-unvaccinated/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;second known child&lt;/a&gt; to die from measles complications in Texas, the heart of the outbreak — the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/08/texas-funeral-measles-vaccine-rfk-jr" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;girl's father told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the anti-vaxxer now running America's healthcare seemed to fall down on the job when he &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;came to pay his respects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He did not say that the vaccine was effective," Pete Hildebrand, the father of the unvaccinated girl, told the newspaper of the Health and Human Services secretary. "I had supper with the guy... and he never said anything about that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite his public change of heart regarding the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, it's not exactly shocking that Kennedy is privately talking out of both sides of his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after the outbreak of the previously-contained respiratory virus claimed its first life — an unvaccinated six-year-old Mennonite girl who, like Hildebrand, died in West Texas' Gaines County — the &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/rfk-jr-five-more-worms" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;brain-wormed political scion&lt;/a&gt; not only &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/rfk-jr-cod-liver-oil-measles" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;touted natural treatments&lt;/a&gt; over vaccination, but also suggested that immunity was better gained by simply &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/rfk-jr-suggests-getting-measles" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;allowing children to get the measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It used to be, when you and I were kids, that everybody got measles. And the measles gave you lifetime protection against measles infection," &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Kennedy told &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt; host Sean Hannity&lt;/a&gt; during a March interview. "The vaccine doesn’t do that. The vaccine is effective for some people for life, but for many people it wanes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That claim, it's worth noting, is undercut by strong evidence that catching measles &lt;a href="https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(19)31728-7/fulltext" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;weakens a child's immune system&lt;/a&gt; so significantly that they may become more susceptible to getting sicker from &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; illnesses down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like with that first measles death, Kennedy once again sent mixed messages about measles prevention and treatment.

All underwent autopsies of their brains.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though binge drinking had the most detrimental effects, even drinking less alcohol was shown to have lasting consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Former heavy drinkers were found to have 89 percent higher odds of developing brain legions compared to teetotalers and moderate drinkers were at a 60 percent higher risk. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the findings, study author Alberto Fernando Oliveira Justo said: 'Heavy alcohol consumption is a major global health concern linked to increased health problems and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We looked at how alcohol affects the brain as people get older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our research shows that heavy alcohol consumption is damaging to the brain, which can lead to memory and thinking problems.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Justo said understanding these effects of alcohol is crucial for public health awareness and 'continuing to implement preventive measures to reduce heavy drinking.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/world-health-organization/index.html" id="mol-3b4db4e0-c936-11ef-83cb-3564571cc7ae" class=""&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; warns that no level of alcohol consumption is safe for health and it is one of the leading preventable causes of death in the US, behind tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol use contributes to nearly 100,000 cancer cases and about 20,000 deaths each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research over the past four decades has revealed a 'causal relationship' between alcohol use and increased risk for at least seven different types of cancer, including of the breast, colon, liver and throat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of how alcohol causes cancer, an advisory from the US Surgeon General Dr Vivek Murthy says there are 'four distinct ways' that it works inside the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First, alcohol breaks down into acetaldehyde once it is consumed. Acetaldehyde is a substance that causes cancer by binding to DNA and damaging it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When DNA is damaged, a cell can begin to grow uncontrollably and create a cancerous tumor.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Second, alcohol generates 'reactive oxygen species, which increase inflammation and can damage DNA, proteins, and lipids in the body through a process called oxidation'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thirdly, alcohol alters hormone levels (including estrogen), which the experts say can play a role in the development of breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And lastly, carcinogens from other sources, especially particles of tobacco smoke, can dissolve in alcohol, making it easier for them to be absorbed into the body, increasing the risk for mouth and throat cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The current US Dietary Guidelines recommend that American men should consume no more than two alcoholic drinks a day and women should consume no more than one alcoholic beverage per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For decades, studies suggested that there was some benefit to drinking moderate amounts of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in recent years, research has swung the other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new Dietary Guidelines will be published in 2026 and it is believed that Americans could soon be urged &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12438233/Americans-limited-two-beers-strict-new-alcohol-guidelines-Bidens-booze-czar.html"&gt;to drink no more than two bottles of beer&lt;/a&gt; or glasses of wine per week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The guidelines will eventually be signed off on by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 60million Americans report binge drinking at least once a year, and on average Americans who drink alcohol say they consume about drinks per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism reports that rates of binge drinking among people ages 18 to 25 are decreasing but remain high (28.7 percent in 2023). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health of full-time college students ages 18 to 22, 46.3 percent drank alcohol and 27.9 percent engaged in binge drinking in the past month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Justo's team noted that a limitation of their study was that it did not look at participants before death and they did not have information on the duration of alcohol consumption and a ranking of their cognitive abilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 20:10:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPR2luWlNqVlZXTTFBZmJOY0t5NHR6MWp6amJ0cFZhdExkVm16R3lsQVFWQlpLZkxrYUNNeUMyLUFyaUdtXzdTNGNoTVV3VWNMNTF4Q3RrNWgwRjFuMjVEQnBaUlZKSzFqVmdWMThPajhsWjE2OTNtLV9ucnpOdFh4d0Q3TXh1OV8yWmdVRGxvaWNyU3NEYmEtd0VB0gGfAUFVX3lxTE5DYVh2bGpVbXlxZFlLQ1NHU2tUUjZ4dERwcjVOMk5SUWtqd1VlSGRwSmJGemg2OUR5bllMSmdheC15RXFJYkl1eVB1cUF3czkzSVJwREl0RE9tZkVyUWxybzJiZ3FwbUpvbmFQWW40Q05oeno5ZERDaGo0ckRmcXBpVXhibTNoX1BlOWNYNUhiUEFyZkZoQVh2TXA1WXI3SQ</guid></item><item><title>Measles case confirmed in Montcalm County, 4th in Michigan - FOX 17 West Michigan News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNU3VmQ1hRNGh2MVY5T1BCQkVqcjFKV3I2WlYwckh6T2ItNXRtd3ZwaFVESVlmWGo2TUNlMmxUZkJIWWR5UUFWbnRNMkU1Y2Y2Ykd3cmdBTkRIQkl5dE9VdlQyQl9QNU9zNmFnU1J2Tmo2S3lsLTE3TGl6OC1UeXgySVlEc05HQW9lYUNCRF9SaFZGUFdfREJ5RHAtejFZdEVUdTBBS243VFFiUGNpYmtYY2JqSTZpcjhocG8w?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;MONTCALM COUNTY, Mich. — A fourth person in Michigan has a confirmed case of measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis was announced Wednesday, April 9, for a person living in Montcalm County.

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who is not immune to measles is at risk of contracting the disease through exposure to an infected individual. The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine provides protection for decades, according to the health department. The vaccine could also help fight an infection if the shot is received within 3 days of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infected people can spread the virus several days before symptoms appear, with the disease taking 1 to 3 weeks to affect a new person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes, white spots on cheeks, gums, and roof of the mouth, plus a rash that starts near the hairline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you believe you were exposed to or have measles, you are encouraged to contact your healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fox17online.com/news/local-news/measles-outbreaks-bring-concerns-as-spring-breakers-come-home" class="ListItem " data-cms-ai="0"&gt;

The statement came after Kennedy attended the funeral of a third measles victim over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy’s response to the outbreak has been widely criticized by &lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/third-measles-death" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;epidemiologists&lt;/a&gt; and public health experts, who argue he failed to give a full-throated endorsement of an extremely effective vaccine, that cases appear to be severely undercounted and that officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The numbers continue to grow by the day, but … the growth rate has diminished substantially,” Kennedy told reporters during a press conference, while promoting his health agenda through the American south-west.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Public health experts have said that, in fact, there is little evidence to support this claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I would compare it to what’s happening in Europe now,” Kennedy continued, according to &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-pulse/2025/04/09/states-race-to-offset-the-loss-of-obamacare-subsidies-00279443" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;. “They’ve had 127,000 cases and 37 deaths. And so, what we’re doing right here in the United States is a model for the rest of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy appeared to reference figures from the World Health Organization (WHO) released in &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/13-03-2025-european-region-reports-highest-number-of-measles-cases-in-more-than-25-years---unicef--who-europe" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;March&lt;/a&gt;. In that instance, global health officials were referring to cases across 53 countries in Europe and central Asia, which make up the WHO’s “European region”. Included in that tally are nations such as Romania and Kazakhstan, which together account for nearly 60,000 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Measles is the most contagious illness that we know of and it is preventable,” said Susan Polan, associate executive director of the American Public &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Association. “What we’re seeing now… is a far, far undercount in terms of the actual number of cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Before the current outbreak, the US had not had a measles death &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/10/vaccines-measles-outbreak-immune-system" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;since 2015&lt;/a&gt;. Three people have now died as a result of the Texas outbreak, and &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;nearly 500&lt;/a&gt; people have gotten sick, according to Texas authorities. Because measles has an average death rate of one to three per 1,000, public health officials believe cases are undercounted. The measles vaccine is 97% effective at preventing the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;On Sunday, Kennedy said CDC staff would be &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-misinformation-playbook-touting-inhaled-steroid-treat-me-rcna200085" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;redeployed&lt;/a&gt; to the outbreak in Texas. This week, Kennedy also said the best way to prevent measles is to get the vaccine. However, he also used his attendance at a measles victim’s funeral to promote &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-misinformation-playbook-touting-inhaled-steroid-treat-me-rcna200085" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;unproven therapies for measles&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We should have had more people on the ground – this should have been a priority for weeks and weeks,” said Polan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Measles was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in the US in 2000. However, anti-vaccine sentiment first stoked by a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/feb/02/lancet-retracts-mmr-paper" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fraudulent scientific paper&lt;/a&gt; in the Lancet and then by non-profits, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/18/instagram-facebook-suspend-robert-kennedy-jr-anti-vax" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;such as the one&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy led for nearly a decade, has stoked a dramatic increase in vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The decline in trust in vaccines has been especially precipitous among Republicans and Republican-leaning adults. A &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Gallup poll&lt;/a&gt; from August 2024 found the percentage of Republicans who believe it is extremely important to vaccinate children fell from more than 60% in the early 2000s to 26% in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As trust in vaccines wanes among Republicans, and Kennedy himself voices lackluster support, Kennedy has enjoyed &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/press-release/poll-trust-in-public-health-agencies-and-vaccines-falls-amid-republican-skepticism/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;high trust ratings&lt;/a&gt; among Republicans – nearly as high as Donald Trump himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy made the comments as the department he oversees, Health and Human Services, undergoes a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/hhs-cdc-fda-layoffs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;dramatic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/09/health-layoff-future-science-disease" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;largely opaque&lt;/a&gt; restructuring. A total of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/rfk-jr-health-department-cuts" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;20,000 positions&lt;/a&gt; have been eliminated between a cut of 10,000 made by Kennedy and an additional 10,000 employees cut by billionaire Elon Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The CDC lost &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restructuring-doge-fact-sheet.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2,400 employees&lt;/a&gt; in the restructuring. Overall, HHS will lose nearly a quarter of its workforce. Kennedy has also installed vaccine skeptics in important roles within the agency, including at least one who has &lt;a href="https://insights.citeline.com/pink-sheet/agency-leadership/us-fda/highly-problematic-acting-fda-commissioner-paused-planned-ok-of-novavax-shot-GUT6LR4X6ZALRMMZAEXYZHY36Y/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;paused approval&lt;/a&gt; of a Covid-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Further, basic research into &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/trump-vaccine-skeptics-research-funding" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt; has been under threat during Kennedy’s tenure. Before he took office, he tried to force the federal government to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rescind authorization&lt;/a&gt; for Covid-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy’s statements also come as HHS has clawed back more than &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/rfk-hhs-layoffs-lawsuit" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$11bn&lt;/a&gt; in funding to local and state health departments – including grants that had funded &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-vaccines-children-weakening-system-hhs-budget-cuts-rcna199188" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;immunization clinics&lt;/a&gt; near the measles outbreak in Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj01FQfJ1-Q" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy denied knowledge of the clawbacks, and said: “I’m not familiar with those cuts … The cuts were mainly [diversity, equity and inclusion] cuts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 19:43:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxQSmZPNzl4NW1MYzVRQnhHeHg0SUg1Wm9wbXR5Y1ZuXy0yU2dkeVhDRDNlRWM1MWVnaUVWSWJNVXFLSGtqZkJjSFNZMVNlMnMzVGNsS0NXTUQzV2NMdDRuX3oySjZJZ1NwbFFWRy1CV2pta3pmVWZpRjBLOUdEVko0OGpzbw</guid></item><item><title>U.S. maternal mortality rate increased 27% over five years, NIH study finds - statnews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPZ1VLb1RwRnljYl9VeXVyTC1FNzYzZjFIMnJMMDB5aVFWemdHYkFEc2RMZDR2b1VSZ0pKWFNsUXhfRGVRQ0JCcEtfcXBWNW04R0toRlFoeUE5S3doUXBwNU9ORW5JcnE3UWxMRFZob3RsWWNSLVhtS1dLQ1JfVGM2U0VXeTFKMXpBUW9NRGVBYnFsakRGLWVpN3VNazNSaFFYSFhDclBnUEpqc2RLMmpMSnBxTzdyRmFpd1pF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new U.S. government paper documenting an increase in maternal mortality from 2018 to 2022 does not hedge in its conclusion, calling the issue “an urgent public health priority.” That it was published amid &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/hhs-layoffs-start-under-rfk-jr-trump-administration/"&gt;massive job and funding cuts at federal health agencies&lt;/a&gt; charged with reducing these deaths has not escaped notice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A week ago, much of the department tasked with monitoring and improving maternal and child health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was placed on leave, while some researchers who study maternal mortality have had their funding rescinded. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a hard time for this to come out,” said Rose Molina, an OB-GYN at Harvard Medical School, who co-authored the study. “We cannot take our eyes off of maternal health right now, and if anything, we need to not just maintain focus, but actually increase investment in maternal health to bring down some of what we’re seeing — increases in pregnancy-related death rates, but also persistent inequities by racial and ethnic groups.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s lead authors, who work at the National Institutes of Health, were not available to comment on the study. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While previous studies have also shown an increase in maternal mortality in the U.S., &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2832320" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published Wednesday in JAMA Network Open, shed light on long-term maternal health because it analyzed deaths up to a year postpartum. By expanding the window studied, the researchers found that cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mental disorders were leading causes of late maternal deaths. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The paper analyzed data from a CDC database that is different from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/prams-maternal-mortality-cdc-layoffs/"&gt;hit hard by cuts last week&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, maternal mortality increased from 25.3 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2018 to 32.6 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2022 — an age-adjusted increase of about 27%. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bottom-line finding lines up with previous research, said Marie Thoma, a reproductive and perinatal epidemiologist at the University of Maryland, who has studied maternal mortality during the Covid-19 pandemic. But the new study provides more detail regarding state-level mortality and reaffirmed the prevalence of inequities by race. Rates of maternal mortality were 3.8 times higher in American Indian and Alaska Native women when compared to white women, and rates in Black women were 2.8 times higher. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She pointed to California as a reason to be optimistic. The state had the lowest rate of maternal mortality, and the authors of the study note that if the nationwide rates of maternal mortality were brought down to California’s level it would have saved 2,679 pregnancy-related deaths. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There was a lot of momentum,” said Thoma. She pointed to a &lt;a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/10/the-white-house-blueprint-for-addressing-the-maternal-health-crisis-two-years-of-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Biden administration blueprint&lt;/a&gt; for maternal health as an example of progress. But now, “there’s just so much uncertainty.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kisha Davis, a member of the board of directors at the American Academy of Family Physicians and chief health officer for Montgomery County, Md., said she has seen progress in mitigating racial disparities in the hospitals within her county. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I saw some really great data from our hospitals, and was really encouraged from some of the interventions that they’re doing, and some of them are even starting to see a reversal in that disparity,” she said, naming initiatives to train clinicians about implicit racial bias, as well as training physicians outside the OB-GYN specialty to better support mothers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, some support for programs mitigating racial disparities has been cut, said Marian Jarlenski, a professor of health policy at the University of Pittsburgh. For example, funding for the Center to Advance Reproductive Justice and Behavioral Health among Black Pregnant/Postpartum Women and Birthing People at the Morehouse School of Medicine, a historically Black medical school, was &lt;a href="https://taggs.hhs.gov/Content/Data/HHS_Grants_Terminated.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cut in the past several weeks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Some of these NIH initiatives to improve maternal mortality were started and funded in the first Trump administration, and they’re still going on. However, NIH has cut off funding for some of these maternal health research centers around the country, so it’s very confusing,” Jarlenski said. “This study that we’re talking about today shows why this is not a political issue, and it’s really important that we all be focusing on how we can reduce maternal mortality and working together on it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;INDIANAPOLIS – The Indiana Department of Health has confirmed five additional cases of measles in Allen County, bringing the state’s total to six cases in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new cases involve three minors and two adults, all connected to the initial case reported earlier this week. The minors were unvaccinated, and the adults’ vaccination status is unclear. Health officials say all six individuals are recovering well, and there are no known links to outbreaks in other states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State and local health departments are contacting those who may have been exposed to prevent further spread. Officials say the risk to the general public remains low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious airborne virus. A single case is considered an outbreak. Symptoms typically appear 7 to 14 days after exposure and include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a spreading rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials urge anyone with symptoms to stay home and call their doctor before seeking care in person.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MONTCALM COUNTY, Mich. — A Montcalm County resident recently traveled out of state and brought back with them a case of the measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes the Montcalm County case the fourth confirmed measles case this year. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mid-Michigan District Health Department (MMDHD) said they're working closely with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to determine points of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MMDHD advised that anyone who is not immune to measles is at risk of catching it. They said the best protection against measles is the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine as the vaccine provides long-lasting protection against measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At MMDHD, we take action to protect, maintain, and improve the health of our community," said Liz Braddock, MMDHD Health Officer. "Measles is a serious disease, and we want to make sure that our residents are safe. If you have recently traveled to regions with known measles outbreaks, and you are not vaccinated against measles, you should consider getting vaccinated as quickly as you can. It is important to make sure you protect yourself and families from this vaccine-preventable disease.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to 9/10 people nearby a person infected with measles will also become infected if they are not protected according to MMDHD.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Infected individuals can spread measles before noticing symptoms, including four days before the rash appears. Measles symptoms usually appear 7 to 14 days after contact with the virus but can take up to 21 days," advised MMDHD in a release.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MMDHD listed the following common measles symptoms to keep an eye out for:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="isPasted"&gt;High fever (may spike to over 104˚F)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny white spots on the inner cheeks, gums and roof of the mouth (Koplik Spots)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that starts as flat red spots on the face at the hairline, then spreads to the trunk, arms and legs three to five days after symptoms begin. Small, raised bumps may also appear on top of the flat red spots&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel you may have been exposed to the measles or develop any of the symptoms listed above, you're asked to call your healthcare provider before seeking treatment so that steps can be taken to prevent exposure to other people before you go in for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The measles vaccine is highly effective, very safe and provides long-lasting protection," said the MMDHD. "A single dose of measles vaccine is about 93% effective at preventing measles, while two doses are about 97% effective. It is also effective if it is given within 72 hours of measles exposure to prevent illness. Anyone not fully vaccinated against measles is encouraged to do so as soon as possible."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor's note: This story previously incorrectly reported this was Michigan's third case of measles this year. It is actually the fourth. The story was updated to include that fourth case in Macomb County.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

It gets a bad rap and is often linked to heart disease so it's not suprising that the very word can cause concern. But not all cholesterol is harmful. In fact, it is essential for a range of functions in your body that you would not survive without. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your body needs cholesterol to perform important jobs like making hormones and building cells. It's also vital for digestion and even the synthesis of vitamin D from sunlight. In fact, every single one of your cells needs it to survive and do the things that keep you alive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cholesterol is a type of fat. If you were able to look at it you'd see a waxy type of substance that's yellow-ish in colour. And, though it's more often than not mentioned in the context of foods like red meat, milk and eggs, the vast majority of cholesterol is in fact made by your own body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;'Good' cholesterol and 'bad' cholesterol&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can split cholesterol into two simple categories: "good" and "bad". Two types of lipoproteins carry cholesterol throughout the body: low-density lipoprotein (LDL), sometimes called "bad" cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or "good" cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When your body has too much LDL cholesterol, it can build up in the walls of your blood vessels. This buildup is called plaque and this is what can lead to a heart attack or stroke. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HDL cholesterol removes the "bad" cholesterol from your arteries, carrying it back to the liver and reducing your risk of a heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But if you find your LDL cholesterol levels are too high there is no need to panic. Not only is there medication available, but you can also reduce your levels of bad cholesterol with your diet. In fact, Dr Sarah Berry, &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/joined-tim-spectors-zoe-plan-30282054" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;chief scientist at science and nutrition firm Zoe&lt;/a&gt; and an academic leader in cardio-metabolic health at King's College London, says "the right diet [can] improve your cholesterol as much as medication".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But what's the one food that nutritionists advise against if you want to minimise your risk of developing high "bad" cholesterol levels? Processed meats. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Processed meats are typically fattier cuts of meat and are high in saturated fat. High saturated fat-containing foods are notorious for causing high cholesterol and increasing levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, specifically,” Carly Hart, a USA-based registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/food-to-limit-to-reduce-high-cholesterol-risk-11709605" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;told Eating Well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And Veronica Rouse, owner of The Heart Dietitian, also told Eating Well: “Even the ‘healthier’-sounding options — like turkey bacon or low-fat deli cuts — aren’t [necessarily] free of saturated fat, they’re just a bit leaner than regular versions but still contribute to your total saturated fat intake for the day.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Processed meats are also likely to be much higher in sodium (salt) than unprocessed meats (it's what gives it that long shelf life as well as the moreish taste). And a diet high in salt also increases your risk of developing high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One cancer dietician goes even further and says bluntly that processed meats are &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/only-two-foods-major-cancer-30669848" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;one of only two foods that cause cancer&lt;/a&gt;.

And her words are backed up by Cancer Research UK, who say: "We know for definite that processed meat is a cause of cancer. We are as sure of this link as we are for other proven causes of cancer, like tobacco and alcohol."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-content-type="opinion" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/quit-ultra-processed-food-15-31198193" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;Processed meat and alcohol&lt;/a&gt; have also been classified as Group 1 carcinogens by the World Health Organisation, meaning they are carcinogenic to humans. In other words, they cause cancer (though this does not mean you will definitely get cancer if you consume them). The WHO says: "This category is used when there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans. In other words, there is convincing evidence that the agent causes cancer."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is processed meat?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The World Health Organisation says processed meat refers to "meat that has been transformed through salting, curing, fermentation, smoking, or other processes to enhance flavour or improve preservation". It says most processed meats contain pork or beef, but processed meats may also contain other red meats, poultry, offal, or meat by-products such as blood and gives the following examples of processed meat:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;hot dogs (frankfurters)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;ham&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;sausages&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;corned beef&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;biltong or beef jerky&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;canned meat&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;meat-based preparations and sauces.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How else can I lower my cholesterol?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With simple steps you can improve your cholesterol levels and lower your risk of serious illness including heart disease. N&lt;/span&gt;utritionist Rob Hobson has given &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/anyone-high-cholesterol-told-follow-31226748" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;eight sensible and easy-to-follow tips to lower bad cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;.

"However, only a handful of U.S. studies have explored sociodemographic or socioeconomic characteristics that put people at risk of long COVID or have investigated its economic and mental health sequelae."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large-scale government funding needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;About 35 million adults and 30 million working-age adults, or roughly 1 in 7, said they had experienced long COVID by late 2022 and 2023. Lost wages due to long COVID among working-age survey respondents were estimated at $211 billion in 2022 and $218 billion in 2023. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An age- and sex-adjusted model of 2022 data from 154,430 participants estimated that those vaccinated against COVID-19 had a 14% lower risk of protracted symptoms than their unvaccinated peers, but a fully adjusted model found no difference in risk. In comparison, a fully adjusted model of 2023 data from 220,664 respondents found a higher risk of long COVID among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Risk factors for the condition were lower household income, Hispanic ethnicity, female sex, and gay, lesbian, or bisexual status. Long COVID was tied to elevated risks of recent unemployment, financial problems, and anxiety and depression. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roughly 14.5 million adults overall and 10.9 million adults with long COVID still had symptoms in fall 2022 and fall 2023, respectively. Among adults with current long-COVID symptoms, there was evidence of a dose-response relationship, with those reporting the most impact on daily functioning having a more than two-fold higher risk of recent depression than those reporting no impact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Overall, an estimated 24 million working-aged adults with long COVID had been or may still be at risk of adverse socioeconomic and mental health outcomes," Kim concluded. "The scale of long COVID and its sequelae necessitates large-scale governmental funding to address long COVID research priorities and a robust and coordinated policy response strategy, as well as ongoing national surveillance of the prevalence and health and economic burden of long COVID."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women, Black participants most affected&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A survey-based &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-025-04039-5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; this week in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; by Anhui Medical University researchers in China highlights the relationship between adverse social determinants of health (SDoH) and long COVID in the United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Black communities are often concentrated in areas with limited healthcare access, environmental pollution, and food insecurity, factors all linked to chronic inflammation and impaired recovery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The investigators parsed data on 16,446 US adults with a history of COVID-19 infection, 3,111 (18.6%) of them with long COVID, from the 2022 and 2023 National Health Interview Surveys from the National Center for Health Statistics. They measured cumulative social disadvantage using 18 SDoH indicators categorized into quartiles. The average participant age was 48.1 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Although the influence of SDoH on health conditions is well established, its relationship with long COVID has yet to be sufficiently explored," they wrote. "Understanding the relationship between cumulative social disadvantage and long COVID is crucial for identifying vulnerable populations and offering more tailored management and support." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Respondents in the highest quartile of social disadvantage were 152% more likely to report long COVID than those in the lowest quartile (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.52). This link persisted across demographic subgroups, with greater effects on women and Black participants and, to a lesser extent, Hispanic and White adults. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The stronger association among non-Hispanic Black groups reflects systemic inequalities beyond socioeconomic status," the researchers wrote. "Black communities are often concentrated in areas with limited healthcare access, environmental pollution, and food insecurity, factors all linked to chronic inflammation and impaired recovery."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role of occupational exposure, discrimination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The greatest social disadvantage burden was seen more often among long-COVID patients than among those without the condition (29.2% vs 15.2%). Adults with protracted symptoms in the most disadvantaged group were more than six times more likely to report poor general health than those in the least disadvantaged group (aOR, 6.34). Risk factors for long COVID included mental illness, financial instability, and poor healthcare access.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Addressing systemic inequities through integrated public health strategies is essential to mitigate the burden of long COVID and reduce social disparities in health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The authors noted that social disadvantage prolongs COVID-19 symptoms by amplifying oxidative stress and immune dysregulation and that disadvantaged groups are more likely to engage in harmful behaviors, which increases their susceptibility to chronic conditions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Beyond poverty, social inequalities such as occupational exposure and racial discrimination also make certain populations more vulnerable to virus exposure," they wrote. "Workers in long-term care facilities and public service sectors, including education, social care, and transportation, are at higher risk for long COVID." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers said that healthcare providers need to take a holistic approach, particularly with socially disadvantaged groups during post-COVID recovery, by incorporating systematic screening for SDoH to identify high-risk populations and offer timely interventions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Addressing systemic inequities through integrated public health strategies is essential to mitigate the burden of long COVID and reduce social disparities in health," they wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This may help explain why frequent cannabis use can increase the risk of hallucinations and delusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using neuromelanin-MRI scans, researchers showed that dopamine-related brain signals were significantly higher in individuals with CUD, and the increase correlated with the severity of use. These findings may help healthcare providers educate youth and high-risk groups about the mental health impacts of chronic cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine Spike:&lt;/strong&gt; People with cannabis use disorder showed elevated dopamine signals in brain regions tied to psychosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Amplified:&lt;/strong&gt; The more severe the cannabis use, the higher the dopamine signal—regardless of schizophrenia diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youth Concern:&lt;/strong&gt; One in five Canadian youth use cannabis frequently, underscoring the need for better public education.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;McGill University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A McGill University-led study found that people with cannabis use disorder (CUD) had elevated dopamine levels in a brain region associated with psychosis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could help explain why cannabis use increases the risk of hallucinations and delusions, key symptoms of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders,” said first author Jessica Ahrens, a PhD student in McGill’s Integrated Program in Neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108537"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood and motivation, and an excess is associated with psychosis. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood and motivation, and an excess is associated with psychosis. While it was known that cannabis influences dopamine, this study clarifies where in the brain these changes occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis use disorder is when someone has trouble controlling their cannabis use, continues despite negative effects, and may experience cravings or withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For a long time, clinical researchers across the world have been searching for a link showing that cannabis affects the brain mechanism behind psychosis. We now show that a shared dopamine pathway could be the answer,” Ahrens said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 61 people, including those with and without cannabis use disorder, as well as individuals with early-stage schizophrenia, some of whom also had CUD. Using a specialized brain scan called neuromelanin-MRI, researchers at Western University measured their neuromelanin signal, which reflects dopamine activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with CUD had an abnormally high neuromelanin signal, and the elevation was tied to the severity of their cannabis use. In contrast, those without schizophrenia or CUD did not show this increase. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educating youth about cannabis risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one-in-five youth in Canada are cannabis users, consuming it daily or almost daily. Understanding the drug’s impact on mental health remains a pressing question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lack of clear biological evidence linking cannabis to psychosis has made it harder to persuade young people with psychotic symptoms to reduce their use,” said Dr. Lena Palaniyappan, Professor of Psychiatry at McGill and Psychiatrist at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings could help doctors and mental health professionals better educate patients about the potential risks of frequent cannabis use, especially for those with a family history of psychosis,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will explore whether long-term cannabis use leads to lasting dopamine changes and whether these effects reverse after quitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Schizophrenia Society of Canada Foundation, the Canadian Consortium for Early Intervention in Psychosis, the Fonds de Recherche du Québec—Santé, the Quebec Bio-Imaging Network, the Canada First Research Excellence Fund, the Canada Research Chairs program and the Canada Foundation for Innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychosis and CUD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3358565a5f521d575643524356735e50545a5f5f1d5052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Keila DePape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mcgill.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Keila DePape – McGill University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2025.0432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Convergence of Cannabis and Psychosis on the Dopamine System&lt;/a&gt;” by Jessica Ahrens et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convergence of Cannabis and Psychosis on the Dopamine System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite evidence that individuals with a cannabis use disorder (CUD) are at elevated risk of psychosis and that the neurotransmitter dopamine has a role in psychosis, the mechanism linking cannabis use and psychosis remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To use neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), referred to as the &lt;em&gt;neuromelanin-MRI signal&lt;/em&gt;, a practical, proxy measure of dopamine function, to assess whether a common alteration in the dopamine system may be implicated in CUD and psychosis and whether this alteration can be observed in those with a CUD whether or not they have a diagnosis of first-episode schizophrenia (FES).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This longitudinal observational cohort study recruited individuals from 2019 to 2023 from an early psychosis service and the surrounding communities in London, Ontario. The sample included individuals with and without CUD, with some in each group also diagnosed with FES.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exposures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FES and CUD diagnoses from the Structured Clinical Interview for &lt;em&gt;DSM-5&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuromelanin-MRI signals within the midbrain (substantia nigra [SN]/ventral tegmental area [VTA]) including a subregion previously linked to the severity of untreated psychosis (a priori region of interest).

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A special type of chewing gum can 'trap' and neutralize some influenza and herpes viruses, according to new experiments from scientists in the US and Finland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1/-2) can both cause oral herpes, and despite being one of the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-more-than-one-in-five-are-infected-with-an-incurable-sti"&gt;most common infections&lt;/a&gt; in the world, there are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;hardly any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; preventative measures available today to stop the spread.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some scientists are hopeful that this new anti-viral gum could help fill that gap, especially as research on a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/diseases/herpes-simplex-virus"&gt;&lt;span&gt;herpes vaccine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; stalls due to a lack of funding. Plus, even if a vaccine is found, there are likely to be breakthrough infections, and chewing gum could help stop those from spreading further.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Current vaccines for influenza, for instance, do not prevent transmission from breakthrough infections, so this gum could be a useful addition for treating orally spread viruses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The clinical-grade chewy is made from lablab bean powder, ground from the seeds of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lablab"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lablab purpureus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; species, which contain a natural viral trap protein called FRIL. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In experiments using a mechanical mouth, chewing the liquid-soaked gum for 15 minutes released more than 50 percent of the FRIL proteins it contained. Collecting the simulated saliva from this chewing, researchers then tested how well the liquid neutralizes viruses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Depending on the dose of FRIL to start with, the 'saliva' produced from chewing showed greater than 95 percent neutralization of the H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses in the lab.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It also showed up to 75 percent neutralization of the HSV-1 virus and up to 94 percent of the HSV-2 virus – the two most common herpes viruses out there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutralization means that the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="157514" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; is less likely to infect cells and replicate itself, which would theoretically lead to a reduce viral load and lower chances of transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"These observations augur well for evaluating bean gum in human clinical studies to minimize virus infection/transmission," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymthe.2024.12.008"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt; the authors, led by biochemist Henry Daniell from the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_157526" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157526" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/gr3_lrg-642x998.jpg" alt="Chewing Gum Mechanics" class="size-medium wp-image-157526" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/gr3_lrg-642x998.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/gr3_lrg-267x415.jpg 267w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/gr3_lrg-768x1194.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/gr3_lrg-988x1536.jpg 988w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/gr3_lrg-1317x2048.jpg 1317w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/gr3_lrg-600x933.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-157526" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The mastication simulator and amount of total protein and FRIL released.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists are now testing that 'anti-COVID' chewing gum in clinical trials, but in the meantime, researchers are turning to other viruses to see if the solution works there as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For instance, another &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108016"&gt;&lt;span&gt;previous study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; published in 2020 on lablab beans found that FRIL proteins effectively reduced levels of H5N1 and H7N9 – both of which are influenza viruses that can cause flu in humans and birds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Controlling transmission of viruses continues to be a major global challenge," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/penn-dental-antiviral-chewing-gum-reduce-influenza-and-herpes-simplex-virus-transmission"&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Daniell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"A broad spectrum antiviral protein (FRIL) present in a natural food product (bean powder) to neutralize not only human flu viruses but also avian (bird) flu is a timely innovation to prevent their infection and transmission."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach seems to be most suitable for reducing viral loads in saliva and the throat area, which are two main sites of oral viral transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US FDA generally considers lablab bean powder to be safe and non-toxic for human use at low enough levels. Whether it proves to be an effective anti-viral in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="157514" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; is another matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymthe.2024.12.008"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Molecular Therapy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
