              &lt;p&gt;New research out this month showcases the ever-present danger posed by coronaviruses, the family of viruses that gave rise to the covid-19 pandemic. Scientists in China have reportedly found a new coronavirus in bats that may be capable of spilling over and infecting humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology led the study, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00144-8"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last week in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;. In lab experiments, the virus appeared to possess a key adaptation that allows it to infect a broad range of mammals, humans included. Other factors are present that make the virus less suited to humans for now, but the scientists say their discovery highlights the importance of studying these sorts of potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coronaviruses are a broad group of viruses that infect mammals and birds, seven of which are known to infect humans. Four of these viruses usually cause a mild cold; one caused a major but short-lived epidemic in the early 2000s (the original SARS virus); another causes MERS, a dangerous but limited zoonotic disease that typically spreads from camels to humans; and SARS-CoV-2—the recently discovered coronavirus that caused the worst pandemic seen in a century, &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid#:~:text=The%20Economist%20built,COVID%2D19.19"&gt;killing upwards of 20 million people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide since appearing in late 2019. Though covid-19 is substantially less deadly now, thanks in large part to vaccines, it still &lt;a href="https://x.com/BNOFeed/status/1893852906765295894"&gt;routinely kills&lt;/a&gt; hundreds of Americans weekly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even before the arrival of covid-19, scientists have long worried about the risk of coronaviruses sparking the next big outbreak, given how widespread they are across the animal kingdom. In 2006, researchers in Hong Kong &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7111821/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; a coronavirus in pipistrelle bats that became known as HKU5-CoV. The discovery was valuable, even if the virus itself didn’t seem to possess the machinery needed to infect humans easily. But the Wuhan scientists say they have now discovered a distinct lineage of HKU5-CoV more capable of jumping over to humans, which they’ve dubbed HKU5-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In the lab, the researchers found evidence that HKU5-CoV-2 could potentially infect a wide range of mammals. It does so by interacting with a protein receptor found in many types of cells, called ACE2. For those who kept up with pandemic-era science, ACE2 is the same receptor that SARS-CoV-2 hacks to infect our cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mammals have slightly different versions of ACE2 from one another, and it’s no guarantee that a bat-infecting coronavirus can bind to the human version of ACE2. But the team’s work found that strains of HKU5-CoV-2 could “efficiently” use human ACE2 (and other mammalian versions of ACE2) to enter cells. HKU5-CoV-2 is more closely related to the MERS virus than SARS-CoV-2 and the researchers also found evidence that antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 may offer little protection against HKU5-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;These findings, however, do not mean that HKU5-CoV-2 is destined to become the next covid. Importantly, no human cases of HKU5-CoV-2 have been reported to date. And even if a virus can theoretically spread from one kind of animal to humans, that doesn’t ensure it will be able to spread between people (the vast majority of the time, it doesn’t). Perhaps significantly, the researchers identified other aspects of the newly found virus that likely hinders it from infecting people easily—a key point they highlighted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Due to these suboptimal factors for human adaptation, the risk of BtHKU5-CoV-2 emergence in human populations should not be exaggerated,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;What this research does show, however, is that our fight against emerging infectious diseases exists in perpetuity. HKU5-CoV-2 might never jump over into humans, but others like it eventually could. Whether it’s a coronavirus, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/tag/bird-flu"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt;, or some other unknown germ, the stage for the next pandemic will be set. So tracking and learning more about these threats as early as possible will be essential to stopping or at least blunting the harm they can cause.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

People drink tea in the morning with breakfast, in between meals for an afternoon caffeine hit and to relax before bed. Most research on tea has focused on the effects of caffeine, tea’s nutritional value or how it &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2022/coffee-vs-tea-nutrition-health/?itid=sr_1_e875d336-6a66-4f11-8473-6fe1ff2c50ef" target="_blank"&gt;compares with coffee&lt;/a&gt;, but now scientists say that the stimulating beverage may provide a surprising health benefit: Your morning cup of tea could be removing dangerous contaminants from your water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QRHSS6UTFZAKPHP7G3ZRQ7CK4E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A new study published in ACS Food Science &amp;amp; Technology&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;found that tea leaves naturally adsorb heavy metals, filtering out harmful water contaminants like lead, cadmium or arsenic. The metals become trapped on the surface of the tea leaves and can be removed by simply filtering out the leaves or tossing the tea bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OBSTWX4YCBBKDH7RWTN2ZKRENQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“You’re taking the metals out of the water with the tea, but you don’t consume the tea leaves after, which is why it works,” said Benjamin Shindel, the study’s lead author, who at the time of the research was a PhD student at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. As tea leaves release flavorful chemicals in the water, creating a tasty drink, they are just as effective at grabbing metals out of the water, Shindel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WZMELII7YRFTFJ53MYAGRU327I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Shindel’s study adds to a small body of research showing that tea adsorbs metals. A study published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024155508" target="_blank"&gt;November&lt;/a&gt; also found that tea leaves removed heavy metals from water. Saddam Husain Dhobi, the lead author of that study, said this research highlights the value of tea and “its potential as a safe and effective method for mitigating harmful substances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HAZSUMFJO5ANBIS3DRGIPL5TJ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the new study, researchers experimented with a variety of teas, brewing methods and steeping times, and they examined the difference between loose-leaf and bagged tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="INIRUJHXB5E2DGIFZKUC33VSJE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And the recipe for the purest cup of tea depends on one major factor: time. The longer the steep time, the more metal that’s removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IZLSQKV4EFDNJNG7IBDIHBNRMY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For example, researchers found that when steeping an average cup of tea for five minutes, there was a 15 percent reduction in lead concentrations — and that trend was consistent across cups, whether the concentrations of lead were higher or lower. Brewing tea overnight, a common method for brewing iced tea, provides better water purification than steeping for a few minutes. But even a few minutes can result in a moderate removal of metals, Shindel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TIFZESZYLVE6FLKELUWZBE5G3A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers also examined different varieties of tea to determine whether they provided any extra benefits. Black and green bagged tea were tested, as were whole tea leaves, including green, oolong, white and black teas. Herbal teas were also tested for their ability to get metals to stick to the surface of the leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UFPZZVJSQBC2VFMNMN7ZZWUSVU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Most teas, including herbal teas, performed similarly — apart from chamomile flowers, which adsorbed metals poorly. The study found that ground tea leaves perform best, compared with whole leaves, because grinding the leaves creates additional surface area for attracting the contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5OKNKSFYZJAVTAP2IS3YB6SMGY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The type of tea bag mattered too. Cellulose tea bags, a biodegradable and organic material derived from trees, were highly effective at sponging metals from water. Nylon tea bags, which can release &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2019/09/27/these-tea-bags-release-billions-plastic-particles-into-your-brew-study-shows/" target="_blank"&gt;billions of microplastics&lt;/a&gt;, did not perform well in the study, and cotton tea bags showed trivial adsorption capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L6FL7KQL2FBDNFAHHGZJJID6OY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Even so, the relative benefits of different tea bags and tea types were “marginal compared to the benefit of having more time,” Shindel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JD2FVULCKJD43ENLQKKLMTYZAU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While Shindel, who now works with the Energy Department’s National Energy Technology Laboratory, can’t definitively say what the human health outcome would be for drinking tea, he suggested that it could lead to declines in illnesses closely correlated to heavy metal exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AE2MSL6RJNCOJIL7PUKIJVJPXM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“People should be aware of the potential that preparing tea has to adsorb a fraction of the metals and potentially other contaminants from drinking water,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 19:00:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPYUg1eGhfQ3R3aHJHV3JON3VudEpRWjZudUJWVlJqY2lZRFlDNk5uSFdPSmk0OE9VbkVJOVVaRmV4UXQ5cWgwdGh4aUs4bFctWTJEYVg3Z1Rab19zTm12LUtuTUFFSnlIRGpSdkwyLXdmSVcwOGhuZjdrNmdLMkxsUlMteWxEUjllVGctWTFyM3BVcmhISnJlR1FR</guid></item><item><title>Is It Time to Rethink That Drink?

Yet, more and more, the science is pointing to the health risks of drinking alcohol. In January, the U.S. Surgeon General issued an urgent health advisory, ranking alcohol as the third leading cause of cancer, right after tobacco and obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This news mirrors what happened back in 1994 when the U.S. Surgeon General at that time sparked a pivotal change in how we perceive health and social norms when he boldly stated that tobacco is linked to cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “For decades, cigarette smoking was socially acceptable, with little awareness of the damage it was doing,” says&lt;a href="https://drchristinemaren.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Christine Maren, D.O.&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified physician specializing in functional medicine. Fast-forward to today, and we are facing a similar wake-up call—this time with alcohol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The new health advisory challenges the way we’ve long viewed alcohol consumption—as a harmless enjoyment, particularly in moderation. But with new data shedding light on the risks, it begs the question: Is it time to take a closer look at our relationship with alcohol? With insights from a range of health experts, we dive into this very question and offer practical tips for those looking to dial back their drinks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-we-thought-about-alcohol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What We Thought About Alcohol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For much of history, alcohol has walked a thin line between remedy and risk—once celebrated as medicine, now known to carry hidden dangers. “The first alcoholic beverages emerged in China around 7000-5600 B.C., but it wasn't until the 16th century that alcohol became deeply embedded in daily life,” says &lt;a href="https://amandaewhite.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amanda E. White, LPC, LMHC&lt;/a&gt;, a licensed therapist, who herself recovered from alcohol misuse and now helps others do the same.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Ancient Egyptians were toasting with beer, Greeks sipped wine at philosophical debates, medieval monks brewed beer as a spiritual practice, and alcohol was once used as a safe alternative to questionable water sources,” says &lt;a href="https://theoncologydietitian.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nichole Andrews, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, an oncology registered dietitian nutritionist.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Jump ahead a few hundred years, and we’ve seen it all—from the hush-hush speakeasies of Prohibition to the glittering cocktail culture immortalized by Hollywood, Andrews shares.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For decades, alcohol was sold as a social aid, a stress reliever and even a heart-health enhancer, often praised in the Mediterranean diet for its supposed benefits when enjoyed as a daily glass of wine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But lately, science has shaken up this narrative. “Today, the conversation is shifting, thanks to mounting evidence showing alcohol’s direct link to cancer, liver disease and even mental health problems. While alcohol may have a deep cultural legacy, it doesn’t get a free pass when it comes to our health,” Andrew asserts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-the-latest-science-says"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What the Latest Science Says &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Cancer Risk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Alcohol is a known carcinogen that increases the risk of at least seven types of cancer, including breast, colon, liver, mouth, esophagus, voice box and throat cancers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The U.S. Surgeon General’s January 2025 advisory tells it to us straight: Alcohol now ranks as the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the United States, responsible for around 100,000 cases and 20,000 deaths each year.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though it may be tempting to toss this risk aside, the reality is that alcohol’s connection to cancer isn’t just about the statistics—it’s rooted in biology. “When alcohol is metabolized, it produces acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct that damages DNA and prevents cells from repairing themselves, creating the perfect storm for cancer development,” says&lt;a href="https://thyroidcancerdietitian.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Julia Diaz, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a thyroid cancer dietitian nutritionist.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It doesn’t stop there: Diaz warns that alcohol also throws your hormones out of balance, spiking estrogen levels and upping breast cancer risks. On top of that, it drains your body of vital nutrients needed to fight off damage, leaving you even more vulnerable to cancer development.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But these effects only kick in when you down too many drinks, right? Guess again. Studies undeniably show that even one drink a day increases your risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Although drinking in moderation is often encouraged, the evidence tells a different story: there’s no safe level of alcohol consumption when it comes to cancer risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Heart Disease Risk  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking in moderation poured into popularity with the belief that sipping on wine could benefit your heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “For years, we were told that a glass of red wine a day keeps the cardiologist away—but science is making it clear: that’s a myth, not a health strategy,” says Andrews.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, what’s the real deal? “The idea that moderate alcohol is ‘heart-healthy’ came from flawed studies full of confounding variables (aka, sneaky factors that distorted the data),” she explains. “Many moderate drinkers in these studies also had healthier lifestyles overall—they exercised, ate nutritious foods and had better access to health care. Meanwhile, heavier drinkers often had additional health risks, making alcohol look better than it actually is.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The truth? Alcohol, even in small amounts, can elevate blood pressure and weaken the heart muscle, leading to increased risk of heart disease, stroke and heart failure over time, says &lt;a href="https://upliftfitnutrition.com/about-lacey-dunn/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lacey Dunn, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a functional medicine dietitian.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, if you’ve been winding down with a glass of wine in hopes of protecting your heart, the latest research suggests it may be doing more harm than good.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Anxiety, Depression and Cognitive Decline Risks &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking may seem like a way to calm life’s storms, but it often adds more weight to the burdens we’re trying to lighten. “People often drink to cope with anxiety or depression, but alcohol actually disrupts our brain chemistry, making these conditions worse long-term,” says White.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Recent studies have identified specific mechanisms by which alcohol alters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate systems, explaining why anxiety often worsens after drinking,” says White.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; She notes that alcohol is a depressant, and our body produces cortisol and adrenaline to counteract its effects. This means that as you sip to find relief from anxiety, you are actually reinforcing a loop that keeps you tethered to the emotions you’re trying to outrun. As a result, you end up feeling more anxious the next day. White shares that drinking to cope with negative emotions is one of the strongest predictors of developing alcohol use disorder.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The irony? Every glass chips away at your brain’s natural ability to manage those feelings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But it’s not just about how you feel. It’s also about how alcohol impacts your memory. “New research indicates alcohol specifically targets the hippocampus, affecting both short-term memory formation and the consolidation of memories during sleep,” says White.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “This not only impacts daily cognitive function but may also contribute to poor decision-making around drinking itself, creating a challenging cycle to break.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Liver Damage &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The liver, in particular, bears much of the brunt, as it’s responsible for breaking down alcohol and removing toxins from the body. Over time, alcohol can pile on the pressure, causing the liver to become overloaded and inflamed. Andrews expresses that this sets the stage for fatty liver disease, alcoholic hepatitis and, in the worst-case scenario, cirrhosis—where the liver is scarred beyond repair and its ability to function goes downhill.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Immune Suppression &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Andrews points out that alcohol takes a toll on the immune system, leaving the body more susceptible to infections and slower healing. “Chronic drinking lowers the production of white blood cells, your body’s natural defense system, increasing the risk of illnesses like pneumonia, tuberculosis and even COVID-19 complications,” she emphasizes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Sleep Disruption &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Think that nightcap is helping you sleep? It’s actually doing the opposite. “While alcohol can make you drowsy, it fragments sleep cycles and suppresses REM sleep, the deep stage crucial for memory, learning and cognitive function,” says Andrews.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; She explains that alcohol reduces sleep quality by increasing nighttime awakenings and decreasing restorative sleep. White shares that newer research shows it also disrupts our slow-wave sleep, which is crucial for physical restoration and memory consolidation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-we-can-do-about-it"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What We Can Do About It &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Now that you know the science, it’s hard to ignore that the pull to drink still lingers, even with the logical awareness of the consequences. After all, alcohol is deeply woven into our social celebrations, cultural traditions and even daily routines. But perhaps, for a moment, you may pause to reflect on your habits—how the last drink made you feel and how it might impact your health in the future. If you are considering cutting back, here are some simple, actionable steps you can take to limit or completely avoid alcohol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Taking a Break from Booze &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As more people embrace initiatives like Dry January and Sober October, taking a break from alcohol has now become more socially acceptable than ever before. As a licensed therapist, White recommends starting with a 30- to 90-day break to get a clear picture of your relationship with alcohol. “This period allows you to identify triggers and develop new coping mechanisms,” she explains. She outlines that it’s about digging into whether those triggers are emotional, tied to your environment, linked to certain exposures or even connected to certain times of the day or year. If it would be helpful, consider reaching out to a professional or someone close to you to guide and hold you accountable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Rethinking Moderation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to drinking alcohol, health institutions recommend moderation. As a reference, the National Institutes of Health defines moderate drinking as up to one drink a day for women and up to two for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But, as we’ve seen, even moderate drinking is risky business. Even if you only drink on special occasions or weekend outings, you may find it helpful to explore life without alcohol entirely. In doing so, you may discover how much healthier you feel, how your relationships strengthen and the unexpected ways your overall quality of life improves. But, whether you set weekly limits or put down the glass completely, it’s about finding what aligns with your personal goals and health needs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Considering Your Social Scenarios &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Drinking culture is deeply ingrained in many social settings—parties, family gatherings, dating and even casual get-togethers—but we have the power to rewrite the script,” says Andrews. The good news is that, nowadays, it’s pretty easy to find nonalcoholic options in bars and restaurants. However, if you know you’re heading to a place where options might be limited, Diaz recommends bringing your own nonalcoholic drink to share. Participating in activities that don’t revolve around drinking, like hiking, yoga or game nights, is also a great way to have fun alcohol-free. But what do you do when your friends start pouring the pressure as freely as the drinks? Diaz highlights the importance of filling your social circle with people who respect your decisions and align with your goals.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finding new ways to celebrate and unwind without alcohol can help build lasting change. Maren shares that one of her top tips is to create a new “anchor”—a special drink that feels celebratory but isn’t alcohol. “In psychology, anchors are the things we associate with a habit, and for many people, drinking is as much about the ritual as it is about the alcohol itself. Rather than feeling like you’re giving something up, replace it with a new ritual,” she wisely advises. From &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7923275/best-nonalcoholic-wines-according-to-a-sommelier/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;alcohol-free wines&lt;/a&gt;, beers and spirits to a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7883572/elderberry-elixir-mocktail/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fancy mocktail&lt;/a&gt;, you can still enjoy the flavors of alcoholic beverages without the actual booze. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With the U.S. Surgeon General’s warning about the impact of alcohol and cancer risk, it’s crucial to take a closer look at how alcohol affects our overall health. From its impact on heart health and mental well-being to liver function, immune support and sleep quality, understanding these risks empowers us to make more informed, mindful choices about alcohol consumption. Whether you choose to cut back completely, consume on occasion or take periodic breaks throughout the year, having this knowledge allows you to make choices that align with your health goals. The conversation about alcohol is evolving, and now’s the time to truly ask ourselves what role it plays in our lives and whether it’s time for a change.&lt;br&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — An unknown illness first discovered in three children who ate a bat has rapidly killed more than 50 people in northwestern Congo over the past five weeks, health experts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interval between the onset of symptoms – which include fever, vomiting and internal bleeding – and death has been 48 hours in most cases and “that’s what’s really worrying,” said Serge Ngalebato, medical director of Bikoro Hospital, a regional monitoring center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These “hemorrhagic fever” symptoms are commonly linked to known deadly viruses, such as Ebola, dengue, Marburg and yellow fever, but researchers have ruled these out based on tests of more than a dozen samples collected so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo began on Jan. 21, with 419 cases recorded and 53 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak began in the village of Boloko after three children ate a bat and died within 48 hours, the Africa office of the World Health Organization said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have long been concerns about diseases jumping from animals to humans in places where wild animals are popularly eaten. The number of such outbreaks in Africa has surged by more than 60% in the last decade, the WHO said in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the second outbreak of the mystery disease began in the village of Bomate on Feb. 9, samples from 13 cases were sent to the National Institute for Biomedical Research in Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, for testing, the WHO said. All samples were negative for common hemorrhagic fever diseases, although some tested positive for malaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, another mystery flu-like illness that killed dozens of people in another part of Congo was determined likely to be malaria.&lt;/p&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The lab finding does raise the possibility that this new bat virus could spread from animals to humans, researchers said in a paper published Tuesday in the journal Cell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The Wuhan virus research center is known for its work on bat coronaviruses. One theory of how the COVID pandemic began is that it leaked from that lab, perhaps through an infected worker. Institute researchers have previously denied working on any viruses that could have started the pandemic. The US in 2023 halted funding for the lab, which had received money through the US-based EcoHealth Alliance, amid the controversy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;This newly discovered bat virus infects cells by binding to a protein found throughout the bodies of humans and other mammals.

The virus is transmitted by direct contact with infectious droplets or by airborne spread when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-4557dbf7&gt;Measles virus can remain infectious in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves an area. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-4557dbf7&gt;Illness onset (high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes) begins a week or two after someone is exposed. A few days later, the telltale rash breaks out as flat, red spots on the face and then spreads down the neck and trunk to the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-4557dbf7&gt;A person is contagious about four days before the rash appears to four days after. People with measles should stay home from work or school during that period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-4557dbf7&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms of Measles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-4557dbf7&gt;Common symptoms for measles include: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul original-article-post="" data-v-03e8ff79 data-v-4557dbf7&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;High fever (as high as 105°F)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Cough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Runny nose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Red and watery eyes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Tiny white spots that may appear inside the mouth 2-3 days after symptoms begin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Rash 3-5 days after other signs of illness. The "measles rash" typically starts at the face and then spreads down to the rest of the body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-4557dbf7&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to prevent getting measles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-4557dbf7&gt;The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized with two doses of a vaccine against measles, which is primarily administered as the combination measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-4557dbf7&gt;Some vaccinated people can occasionally develop measles; however, they generally experience milder symptoms and are less likely to spread the disease to other people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-4557dbf7&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do if you've been exposed to measles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-4557dbf7&gt;If you think you have measles or have been exposed to someone with measles, isolate yourself from others and call your healthcare provider before arriving to be tested so they can prepare for your arrival without exposing other people to the virus. Measles is extremely contagious and can cause life-threatening illness to anyone who is not protected against the virus. Review your and your child’s vaccination history to see if you are up-to-date on your measles vaccines. Additionally, discuss with your provider your vaccination history and any questions about these vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-4557dbf7&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controlling outbreaks in group settings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul original-article-post="" data-v-03e8ff79 data-v-4557dbf7&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;People with confirmed or suspected measles should stay home from school, work, and other group settings until after the fourth day of rash onset.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;During an outbreak, people without documented immunity from vaccination or previous measles infection should be isolated from anyone with measles to protect those without immunity and control the outbreak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;According to the Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Rule §97.7, schools and childcare settings shall exclude unimmunized children for at least 21 days after the last date the unimmunized child was exposed to a measles case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div original-article-post="" class="group-source-title" data-v-4fbf7207 data-v-4557dbf7&gt;&lt;p class="group-source-paragraph" data-v-4fbf7207&gt;&lt;b data-v-4fbf7207&gt;The Source:&lt;/b&gt; Information in this article comes from the Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;p data-uid="fts-ar-17" class="vendor-unit" data-v-4557dbf7&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>FOX 4 News Dallas-Fort Worth</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 18:12:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOMEczWmZmdkt3RkcxUV9uVWlrZGl1VS1xWjIwa2M0NU8tbldIeFhqVHBrWDdkRVQzOVg2MzRfamVSa3lPalBYM3hrZVZ1SkYycDQ5TTRVV3p1VU1EZ1hNU25NbVpuT3lmcC0wbExEUWdHcTVPZ0dhVmNJck1sY0EwNFdMWG_SAYoBQVVfeXFMTlh3OURHLUs5aWVtWFhkOXZEbVE1eVNMRzBuakRfal9UUjR1RU15OUl0dHQ1TWtFNEw3b2xLTzNXRlc1MnRKSERTT0JZQ3ZtWHpOeTFMaFozZU9lTkw4SUs0X1lvMHRCMVpGQWpXenhvcXBUSnNoRnFkSmFSN19YZnE0RnFwSWV5c0ZR</guid></item><item><title>A Kidney Transplant Came With an Unwelcome Hitchhiker: A Deadly Tick Germ - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPSWtjRGVEWkVra3NTbjZmUy1uVU91MzhoZGNwM0hDTTd4UFN4QVFiUlJGaUZtNTNoMmlnZkVlQ1BhNk9DelZoQkNGS2V6M1RORi1QbDJEY2dfTnNFU1FsU09RTWVTSmtLNG1IRXhDZXk0WEhtYXFOVmlIT1hSTzhqTzlUcHliTkFURTJ4eFhwczA5OUk5dEd1eEN4cHdhZ09WdzJN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;A person’s precious organ donation came with an unexpected visitor. In a new paper out this month, scientists have documented an unconventional way of catching a rare germ normally spread by ticks: from a person’s infected donated kidney.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors and health officials detailed the unusual mishap in a report &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/3/24-1723_article"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Monday in the journal &lt;em&gt;Emerging Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt;. Both the living donor and recipient became sick soon after their operations, leading doctors to discover that the former had transmitted an infection caused by &lt;em&gt;Ehrlichia &lt;/em&gt;bacteria. Fortunately, the tainted transfer was detected in time and both patients were treated successfully.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ticks are prolific carriers of many germs, including the germs behind Lyme disease, relapsing fever, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ehrlichiosis/about/index.html"&gt;ehrlichiosis&lt;/a&gt;. Several species of bacteria cause ehrlichiosis, though most cases are tied to &lt;em&gt;Ehrlichia chaffeensis&lt;/em&gt;. The disease is rarely documented, though cases have been increasing over time. In 2022, there were 1,570 reported cases of ehrlichiosis compared to 201 cases in 2000, when the disease first became nationally tracked. But this most recent case is even rarer than usual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report authors, the donor was a 33-year-old man from Minnesota who agreed to donate his kidney to an unrelated recipient. He had no obvious red flags, passing all the typical screening tests, which include looking for infections that could be dangerous if passed onto a transplant recipient. His recipient was a 24-year-old man with end-stage kidney disease from Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Both men’s operations went smoothly. But on the same day after his kidney was removed, the donor developed a rash on his left hip and leg along with muscle pain and weakness. Doctors diagnosed him with rhabdomyolysis, a condition where muscle tissue rapidly breaks down and releases proteins that damage organs, particularly the kidney. Doctors stabilized him quickly, and he recovered well enough to be discharged six days after the operation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The recipient, meanwhile, appeared fine at first. But a week after the transplant, he was admitted to the hospital with fever, joint pain, and fluid build-up around his kidneys. Given the man’s other symptoms, including a low platelet count, the doctors tested him for various tickborne germs, which eventually confirmed the presence of &lt;em&gt;E. chaffeensis&lt;/em&gt; bacteria. He was given a new course of antibiotics standard for these infections and eventually recovered as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All ehrlichiosis cases in the U.S. must be reported to state health agencies. The recipient’s organ transplantation, coupled with the fact that he had no other risk factor for ehrlichiosis (such as traveling recently to tick-laden parts of the U.S.), prompted a wider investigation by health officials in both Wisconsin and Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eventually, they discovered that the donor had traveled to Kansas for a hunting trip a month before his operation, and that he had to remove several ticks from his clothing and body while there. He also felt sick a week before the transplant, though he attributed it to simple food poisoning. Other tests found evidence of the bacteria in the donor and in the transplanted kidney.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The laboratory evidence, exposure history, and epidemiology of ehrlichiosis strongly support donor-derived transmission of &lt;em&gt;E. chaffeensis&lt;/em&gt; initially acquired by the donor through a tick bite in Kansas 3 weeks before donation,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Transplanted cases of ehrlichiosis are exceedingly rare, but not unheard of—and they can be deadly. A 2021 paper, for instance, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8906657/"&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; two deaths likely caused by ehrlichiosis caught from a single deceased donor’s kidneys in 2020. The typical fatality rate is around 1%, though roughly 60% of patients still get hospitalized as a result. But ehrlichiosis and other infections are generally more dangerous for transplant recipients, since they have to take immune-suppressing drugs to avoid organ rejection.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Given how rare this disease is, the doctors say it wouldn’t be justified to routinely screen for it in donors. But transplant doctors should keep an eye out for the potential risk posed by ehrlichiosis and other germs normally spread by ticks. “In summary, clinicians should remain vigilant for tickborne infections in potential organ donors, particularly those with known exposure to common disease vectors,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Spoiler: These tiny seeds are absolutely packed with nutrients, making them a powerhouse ingredient you can add to a range of dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But unlike some buzzy nutritional foods, chia seeds have some solid scientific research to back up their health halo. In fact, a recent study found that these seeds can do your health a solid on a range of fronts, including lowering your blood pressure and cholesterol, and even helping you to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the deal with chia seeds, plus why nutrition experts are all about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: Scott Keatley, RD, co-owner of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;; Christy Brissette, RD, nutritionist and owner of &lt;a href="https://80twentynutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:80 Twenty Nutrition;;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;80 Twenty Nutrition;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=dhk84" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Danbee Kim;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Danbee Kim&lt;/a&gt;, MD, nutrition expert and assistant professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39299649/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Prostaglandins &amp;amp; Other Lipid Mediators;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Prostaglandins &amp;amp; Other Lipid Mediators&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;last September, analyzed data from 14 clinical trials that involved 835 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the study found that adding chia seeds to your diet could help lower your cholesterol and your risk of cardiovascular disease, control blood pressure, and help manage weight. Specifically, researchers noted a drop in LDL (bad) cholesterol and blood pressure and a “notable” drop in the levels of triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood that’s linked to heart disease, in individuals who consumed higher amounts of chia seeds. This was actually apparent in people who ate both higher amounts—more than 35 grams—and lower amounts—less than 35 grams—of chia seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the health benefits of chia seeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds have a lot of good things going for them. Fun fact: The Aztecs dubbed them ‘running food’ because they were used as a vital energy source during long expeditions when food supplies were scarce, says Christy Brissette, RD, nutritionist and owner of &lt;a href="https://80twentynutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:80 Twenty Nutrition.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;80 Twenty Nutrition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, these tiny seeds are a good source of soluble and insoluble fiber, both of which are good for your digestive health, Brissette says. "Not only does it help you stay regular [with bowel movements], the fiber in chia seeds can help you feel more full and support weight management,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The soluble fiber can also prevent post-meal blood sugar spikes and helps trap cholesterol to remove it from your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds are also nutrient-dense, serving up plenty of fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, protein, and micronutrients like calcium, magnesium, and iron, points out Scott Keatley, RD, co-owner of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;. “The omega-3s they contain contribute to anti-inflammatory benefits and may support heart health by improving lipid profiles,” he says. “Additionally, their antioxidant content helps combat oxidative stress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A previous &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9834868/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:scientific analysis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;scientific analysis &lt;/a&gt;even found that the antioxidants and polyphenols in chia seeds may help to lower the risk of several cancers, including breast, colorectal, liver, and pancreatic cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do chia seeds impact the body?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds can do a few things for you. “Chia seeds absorb water and form a gel, which slows digestion and can promote fullness, potentially aiding weight management,” Keatley says. (Because they absorb liquid, just be aware that eating them dry in large amounts could cause digestive issues, like bloating and gas.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s hard to say that adding any one food to your diet will cause a big change in your health. But chia seeds have the potential to add these perks to your life when they’re coupled with other healthy lifestyle habits, according to &lt;a href="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=dhk84" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Danbee Kim;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Danbee Kim&lt;/a&gt;, MD, nutrition expert and assistant professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower blood pressure and cholesterol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promote better digestion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Help with weight management&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower bodily inflammation to help protect against chronic disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Help with diabetes blood sugar management&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much should I be consuming?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There isn’t a universally recommended dose for chia seeds. Nutrition experts generally recommend aiming for a tablespoon a day. If you end up having more than that, great. If you're consuming less, don't worry. You’re still getting plenty of nutrients and reaping the health benefits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just remember: “To prevent digestive discomfort, it's important to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water,” Dr. Kim says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the best ways to eat chia seeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds are surprisingly versatile, Brissette says. She recommends sprinkling them on &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a45645043/passion-dragon-fruit-chia-pudding-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:yogurt;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;yogurt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a40592712/baked-pumpkin-oatmeal-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:oatmeal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;oatmeal&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a24733894/are-acai-bowls-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:acai bowls;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;acai bowls&lt;/a&gt;. “They’re also great on top of salads or on avocado toast, or as chia pudding,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kim also suggests adding whole or ground chia seeds to smoothies, juices, pancake batter, and baked goods like muffins and bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brissette even uses chia seeds to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a63904726/best-high-protein-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:replace eggs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;replace eggs&lt;/a&gt; in baking. “Just mix one tablespoon of chia seeds with three tablespoons of water,” she says. “Let it sit for five minutes and it will form a gel and then add to your wet ingredients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any risks or side effects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds can cause bloating or gas if you’re not used to a high-fiber diet, Keatley says. So, start slow before ramping up consumption. And since chia seeds absorb liquid and expand, eating them dry could even pose a choking hazard, Keatley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seed allergies do exist, so if you have one, stay away from this health food. (If you’re unsure, Dr. Kim says that chia seed allergies tend to overlap with sesame seed allergies.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kim also recommends being aware that chia seeds may alter the effect of some medications, including drugs used for diabetes and blood pressure, along with blood thinners. They may also interact with some supplements you’re taking. The fiber and phytic acid in chia seeds “may reduce zinc, calcium, and iron absorption,” Dr. Kim says. Basically, if you’re on one of these medications or take a supplement, it’s a good idea to check in with your doctor before adding a steady stream of chia seeds to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have chia seeds in your diet right now, nutritionists recommend giving them a try. “I'm a chia seed superfan,” Brissette says. “They’re nutritional rock stars.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 17:07:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTFBtR01GQzFOcG55VzdTTkJscnVtOHl6M3h0ZHZ2YnFJOHJrbl9zNElfanJHYU44enBUai1VX0dGbUJ6VW9nbEpNdVI1bWNBY1RtMjFBSnpNS1pRV3BGWWlhZjA4eUJpVEhXXzNTS2NDQlI2MW03cW4xTw</guid></item><item><title>Brewing tea removes lead from water - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxOdjd4amJQeTM2VjF0bUIyVzhWVElrUExNNDlPcFExTVg4RUlNTml5V212aVFlRXQ0cl9JTzdkc0hmUTZnV1MyU2NVTmQxTXVqOXhtX216bXMwMFdPalVmdzFJeFJWQzM0MHhSNDEtSEEtajg0U0h5bl9YSWpXdW5zQUlB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test their hypothesis, the authors purchased Lipton and Infusions commercial tea bags, as well as a variety of loose-leaf teas and herbal alternatives: black tea, green tea, white peony tea, oolong tea, rooibos tea, and chamomile tea. The tea bags were of different types (cotton, cellulose, and nylon). They brewed the tea the same way daily tea drinkers do, steeping the tea for various time intervals (mere seconds to 24 hours) in water spiked with elevated known levels of lead, chromium, copper zinc, and cadmium. Tea leaves were removed after steeping by pouring the tea through a cellulose filter into a separate tube. The team then measured how much of the toxic metals remained in the water and how much the leaves had adsorbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the type of tea bag matters. The team found that cellulose tea bags work the best at adsorbing toxic metals from the water while cotton and nylon tea bags barely adsorbed any contaminants at all—and nylon bags also release contaminating microplastics to boot. Tea type and the grind level also played a part in adsorbing toxic metals, with finely ground black tea leaves performing the best on that score. This is because when those leaves are processed, they get wrinkled, which opens the pores, thereby adding more surface area. Grinding the tea further increases that surface area, with even more capacity for binding toxic metals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the most significant factor was steeping time: the longer the steeping time, the more toxic metals were adsorbed. Based on their experiments, the authors estimate that brewing tea—using a tea bag that steeps for three to five minutes in a mug—can remove about 15 percent of lead from drinking water, even water with concentrations as high as 10 parts per million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have probably heard the saying that the &lt;strong&gt;eyes are the windows to the soul&lt;/strong&gt;, but new research shows they are also connected to how we breathe. Scientists at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Groningen in the Netherlands have confirmed that&lt;strong&gt; pupil size&lt;/strong&gt; fluctuates in sync with breathing, revealing a deeper link between our vision and bodily rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Well-known Triggers Of Pupil Changes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have studied pupil size to understand attention, emotion, and medical conditions. Three key factors were known to influence how pupils react: light exposure, cognitive effort and focus and emotional arousal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;German researcher &lt;strong&gt;Irene Loewenfeld&lt;/strong&gt; once stated: “Man may either blush or turn pale when emotionally agitated, but his pupils always dilate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;These pupil responses are so consistent and reliable that they are often used in psychology, neuroscience, and medical diagnoses. If a pupil fails to react to light, for example, it can signal a neurological emergency &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/10/consumed-by-many-this-oil-could-increase-the-risk-of-stroke/"&gt;such as a stroke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Newly Discovered “Pupillary Respiratory Phase Response”&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers have confirmed a fourth factor influencing pupil size: breathing. In a newly identified phenomenon called pupillary respiratory phase response, pupils tend to be largest during exhalation and smallest at the start of inhalation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that our vision may switch between optimizing for distinguishing small details when we inhale and detecting faint objects when we exhale, all within a single breathing cycle,” said Martin Schaefer, postdoctoral researcher,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This effect is entirely internal, originating within the body rather than as a reaction to external stimuli. The &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381860248_The_Respiratory-Pupillary_Phase_Effect_Pupil_size_is_smallest_around_inhalation_onset_and_largest_during_exhalation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;research team&lt;/a&gt; reviewed past studies and found anecdotal hints of this connection &lt;strong&gt;dating back over 50 years&lt;/strong&gt;, but prior evidence remained inconclusive at best.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were also asked to modify their breathing patterns, switching between nose and mouth breathing and adjusting their breathing rate. “Pupil size remained smallest around the onset of inhalation and largest during exhalation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A New Tool For Diagnosing Brain Disorders?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In medicine, pupil reactions are already used to assess brain function. For instance, if pupils fail to respond to light, it could signal a neurological emergency such as a stroke or brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;With this new discovery, researchers suggest that irregularities in the connection between breathing and &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/ai-can-spot-your-stroke-risk-through-a-simple-eye-test/"&gt;pupil&lt;/a&gt; size might serve as an early indicator of neurological disorders. Conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/uncovering-alzheimers-could-herpes-be-a-key-player/"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;, or even anxiety disorders could potentially disrupt this newly identified breathing-pupil link.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Where Do We Go From Here?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now that researchers have confirmed the link between breathing and pupil size, the next step is to explore its broader significance. Future studies may investigate whether manipulating breathing patterns can enhance focus or visual clarity, potentially offering new techniques for improving cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, they may examine whether other internal rhythms, such as heartbeat or blood flow, influence pupil behavior, further uncovering how the body and brain work in sync. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This discovery suggests that, in ways we are only beginning to understand, our bodies actively shape our experience of reality—one breath at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

For one, their injury or condition is more likely to worsen, extending their recovery time and boosting the odds they develop complications from procedures, Patel says. Meanwhile, daily tasks like work, laundry, or tending to children become extremely difficult to impossible to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It doesn’t help that women “have more responsibilities that are non-negotiable,” Baxter says.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Leaving WHO requires the approval of Congress and that the US meets its financial obligations for the current fiscal year. The US also must provide a one-year notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His administration also told federal health agencies to stop most communications with the public through at least the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Stopping communications and meetings with WHO is a big problem,' said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a University of Southern California public health expert who collaborates with WHO on work against sexually transmitted infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People thought there would be a slow withdrawal. This has really caught everyone with their pants down,' said Klausner, who said he learned of it from someone at CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Talking to WHO is a two-way street,' he added, noting that the two agencies benefit from each other's expertise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The collaboration allows the US to learn about new tests, new treatments and emerging outbreaks - information 'which can help us protect Americans abroad and at home,' Klausner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Susan Coller Monarez is an American health scientist who is Principal Deputy Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC details nearly 30 people to WHO and sends many millions of dollars to it through cooperative agreements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US agency also has some of the world's leading experts in infectious diseases and public health threats, and the two agencies' staffers are in daily contact about health dangers and how to stop them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The collaboration halt isn't the only global health effect of Trump's executive orders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another move, the president froze spending on another critical program, PEPFAR or the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The anti-HIV program is credited with saving 25 million lives, including those of 5.5 million children, since it was started by Republican President George W. Bush. It was included in a Trump administration freeze on foreign aid spending slated to last at least three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PEPFAR provides HIV medication to more than 20 million people 'and stopping its funding essential stops their HIV treatment,' International AIDS Society President Beatriz Grinsztejn said in a statement. 'If that happens, people are going to die and HIV will resurge.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Using a computer model of the basal ganglia and thalamus, researchers showed that holding too much information at once confuses the brain, impairing its ability to learn and use stored data effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model demonstrated that the brain compensates for this limitation by strategically “chunking” related information together, improving efficiency. These findings also shed light on dopamine-related disorders like Parkinson’s and ADHD, suggesting new treatment approaches targeting the basal ganglia and thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning Shapes Memory Limits:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain restricts working memory capacity to prevent overload and optimize learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chunking Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; To conserve space, the brain compresses related information, improving recall efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine’s Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Disruptions in dopamine delivery impair memory efficiency, linking working memory deficits to conditions like Parkinson’s and ADHD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Brown University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working memory is what allows humans to juggle different pieces of information in short-term scenarios, like making a mental grocery list and then going shopping or remembering and then dialing a phone number. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scientists agree that the capacity of working memory is limited, they offer competing theories about how and why this is true. But new research from scientists at the Carney Institute for Brain Science at Brown University shows why limits on working memory exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107949"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity.jpg" alt="This shows brain scans." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;When she challenged the model to the same series of trials, the results showed that without a healthy dopamine delivery system, the model did not learn how to use its storage space as efficiently and did not chunk items as often. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Frank, a professor of cognitive and psychological sciences affiliated with the Carney Institute, and Aneri Soni, a graduate student in his lab, developed a new computer model of the basal ganglia and the thalamus — the parts of the brain relevant to working memory — that shows why limits on working memory exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to their study published in &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt;, the answer has to do with learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The simulations we ran show that if we did hold more than just a few items at a time, it becomes too difficult to learn how to manage so many pieces of information at once, such that the brain gets confused and can’t use the information it does store,” Soni said. “At the same time, our research demonstrates that when faced with these limitations, the brain responds by learning to strategically tap into a mechanism to help conserve space.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the neurotransmitter dopamine plays an important role in how learning relates to working memory, the researchers said these findings shed new light on dopamine-related disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team arrived at their discovery by building and testing a new computer model of the brain that replicated the results of an experiment with humans conducted in 2018 by researchers in Frank’s lab and researchers in the lab of Matt Nassar, a Carney Institute assistant professor of neuroscience and cognitive and psychological sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That study established that humans are capable of “chunking” information by compressing related pieces of information together in working memory to conserve space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soni knew she’d successfully built a brain-like computer model capable of compressing information when she challenged her model to a version of the 2018 experiment. She showed the model a screen with colored blocks oriented in different directions and then asked it to recall which colored block was pointing in which direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the course of a number of trials, the model learned how to strategically compress information and began chunking together similar colors, such as blue and light blue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lab’s simulations with the new model point to learning, rather than capacity, as the real driver of working memory, Soni said. She established this by running the trials on a model without the ability to chunk but with plenty of space to store items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She found that while the model with the chunking mechanism was able to strategically store information to its full storage capacity, the model without the chunking mechanism did not seem to realize it had access to such a large amount of storage and was worse at both storing and retrieving the items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A component critical to the model’s learning process is a mechanism that emulates the human brain’s dopamine delivery system, Soni said. When the model was doing a better job of recalling the orientation of a larger number of blocks because it had chunked similar colors together to save space, the dopamine delivery system kicked in, telling the model to continue to use this strategy when faced with the same set of constraints in subsequent trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another part of the experiments, Soni altered the model’s dopamine delivery system to emulate what is known about dopamine levels in patients with Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia and ADHD. When she challenged the model to the same series of trials, the results showed that without a healthy dopamine delivery system, the model did not learn how to use its storage space as efficiently and did not chunk items as often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New findings like this show how computational brain science can advance psychiatry, said Frank, who directs Carney’s Center for Computational Brain Science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Take Parkinson’s disease as an example,” Frank said. “Most people think of it as a movement disorder because changes in movement are so obvious. But it turns out that Parkinson’s patients also have changes in working memory. They are generally treated with drugs that target the prefrontal cortex, but our findings suggest that we should be testing whether drugs that target the basal ganglia and thalamus help to improve symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank said that an increased understanding of what takes place within the basal ganglia and thalamus for people diagnosed with dopamine-related disorders may spur clinicians to adopt different treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was supported by the Department of Defense (ONR MURI Award N00014-23-1-2792) and the National Institute of Mental Health (R01 MH084840-08A1, T32MH115895).

Traditional cognitive accounts focus either on limitations on the number or items that can be stored (slots models), or loss of precision with increasing load (resource models).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that a neural network model of prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia can learn to reuse the same prefrontal populations to store multiple items, leading to resource-like constraints within a slot-like system, and inducing a trade-off between quantity and precision of information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such “chunking” strategies are adapted as a function of reinforcement learning and WM task demands, mimicking human performance and normative models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moreover, adaptive performance requires a dynamic range of dopaminergic signals to adjust striatal gating policies, providing a new interpretation of WM difficulties in patient populations such as Parkinson’s disease, ADHD and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These simulations also suggest a computational rather than anatomical limit to WM capacity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 14:23:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE9jRGZIa2lKVEg2OVo5bzZ3YlF3cGJWOWdSMHc2NHhORl81QmJBVi03bEkxbGdvUlRKRkI4MnE2ZDFqbDJhVnd6ZnQydFBjVFVhMG0xZ1RMSm1RSnR4am9XQkx1RG1jendqcjJr</guid></item><item><title>Oregon’s flu season one of the worst in the past decade - Oregon Public Broadcasting</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxOQkFaa3UzYjVMaVhvVWwyNTMyTk1sOXhLQUt5WTRRa3pxWmpPU1dPS0s5aGRuc1pYLWdaWjh5NGRlY0ZrVnFJWWs2OS1HbDBueTJ0SUVMUzBuR01XQTlzZ2dIbHNDSmRWNk5ObFNqU3BJQVFOandYQmdlekdNQ0FwSUw2RENPVjVnd2RIVEFhQVdZMWFIbGgzdEpFc1dJYkNnVmxycjVxNFZPMzhKNGVydkR4R2RaVjdhUTFRY2FMTWc5UVJFWlFr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black article-body__image--full"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/OC3IWFQ5UNHFTLXA7SJZKMIUNM.tif?auth=afe08a9fd775e1218858af311534112c4f6db025f9762ea669d9f7e1f36ccfcd&amp;amp;width=150" alt="Captured in 2013, this negative stained transmission electron microscopic image captured some of the ultrastructural details exhibited by the influenza A virus." class="width_full"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="background_lgray"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Captured in 2013, this negative stained transmission electron microscopic image captured some of the ultrastructural details exhibited by the influenza A virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__image-by color_dgray f_s_xxs m-none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Courtesy of Cynthia S.

It looked like the beginning of the end for the flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Then something unusual happened, said Dr. Paul Cieslak, medical director for communicable diseases at the Oregon Health Authority. The test positivity rate for influenza started to climb again, along with hospitalizations. Last week, 21% of flu tests came back positive. The week before, the percentage was even higher. Both peaks have been due to Influenza A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;State health officials don‚Äôt have the capacity to track flu hospitalizations statewide, so the Portland metro area serves as a proxy for how severe the season is. Since the start of flu season in October, OHA has reported 1,345 influenza hospitalizations in Clackamas, Multnomah and Washington counties. That number appears to be on par with what the state reported in the 2017-2018 season, a notably bad year for flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;The hospitalization rate is the highest for people 65 years and older by far. That population accounts for about half of the patients hospitalized from the flu in the Portland metro area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚ÄúThis is not a quiet year for flu. I think it‚Äôs gonna be one of our worst,‚Äù Cieslak said. ‚ÄúI would definitely get vaccinated if you haven‚Äôt already.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body--padding f_primary f_bold color_dgray"&gt;The flu shot: not perfect, but effective&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;The CDC recommends the flu shot annually for everyone 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black article-body__image--full"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/Q3GU6O5FDZBZZERI3BGJ3WHHLM.jpg?auth=528523ec536ba589e7d03d6aa0f35b36ebf15226011d55e87011f913ea86a7d8&amp;amp;width=150" alt="FILE - A flu vaccine is displayed at a pharmacy in New York, on Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2024." class="width_full"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="background_lgray"&gt;&lt;p&gt;FILE - A flu vaccine is displayed at a pharmacy in New York, on Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__image-by color_dgray f_s_xxs m-none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mary Conlon / AP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Despite that, less than half of Oregonians typically get their annual flu shot. And the percentage that does has been falling. Five years ago, 36.5% of Oregonians had their flu shot by late February. To date this flu season, &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oregon.immunization.program/viz/Oregon_Influenza_Vaccination/Statewide" target="_blank"&gt;29% of Oregonians have been vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;To Hasson, who treats people for flu complications in the ICU every year, the flu shot is the single vaccine she would recommend above all others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Yet the shot has a reputation for not working well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt our best vaccine,‚Äù when compared to shots like the measles vaccine, which prevent almost all cases of infection, Cieslak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚ÄúIn a typical year, flu vaccine is 40% to 50% effective against having to go to the doctor with the flu. It‚Äôs better, maybe 60%, in keeping you out of the hospital, but there are always some cases that manage to get through despite vaccination,‚Äù he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;What that means is that many people who get the flu shot will get the virus anyway, giving the shot bad word of mouth and contributing to people skipping it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;The problem, according to Hasson, is that influenza is a more serious virus that many people realize. It can affect the entire body, attacking the heart, lungs, brain and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;In cases in which people felt miserable and view the shot as not having worked, it may have provided some protection against even worse outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;In 2019, with funding from the CDC, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/75/2/230/6506316" target="_blank"&gt;researchers looked more closely&lt;/a&gt; at the most serious outcomes of the flu in children: patients who were sick enough to need a ventilator and those who died from the virus. That study found that even in a year when the flu shot was not a great match for the strains of the virus that were circulating, it reduced the worst outcomes for kids by about 75%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black article-body__image--full"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/2MAMT5TRJBA77ONL5R7AEB3I2I.jpg?auth=bb2d404460ffdb348ef1da857878d12da7fca6fb84c009bae76b92a443ef7ea8&amp;amp;width=150" alt="FILE - A patient is given a flu vaccine Oct. 28, 2022, in Lynwood, Calif.

Terrill / AP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;To date, OHA has reported 22 children 4 years and under hospitalized due to the flu. Fifty-two children between 5 and 17 years old have been hospitalized. In December, OHA reported two pediatric deaths due to flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Hasson said that pediatric deaths from flu are rare. But the influenza virus is much more likely than others that have been in the news ‚Äî RSV, COVID-19 or norovirus ‚Äî to cause extended hospitalizations for children. Some of those extended battles with the virus can cause long-term harm, leaving kids in need of ongoing oxygen support or unable to participate in sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;This year, the ICU at Randall Children‚Äôs Hospital has treated higher-than-usual numbers of children with complex cases of influenza, she said. Those include cases in which a child, weakened by the flu virus, develops a secondary bacterial infection or abscess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Hasson said the ‚Äúoverwhelming majority‚Äù of children who need prolonged ICU stays have not been vaccinated against the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Along with getting the vaccine, another step health officials recommend is proactively testing for the virus. For the first time this year, there‚Äôs an at-home test for the flu available over the counter at pharmacies: the single-swab tests for influenzas A and B and COVID-19. Antiviral treatments for flu work best if they are started one or two days after symptoms begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body--padding f_primary f_bold color_dgray"&gt;Changes at the federal level&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;The severe flu season also comes in the midst of policy changes on the federal level that trouble Hasson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Last week, NPR and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;STAT reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pulled the plug&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on a paid ad campaign for the flu vaccine, called Wild to Mild, shortly after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was appointed as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. A spokesperson for HHS told NPR that officials inside the CDC were ‚Äúfalsifying and misrepresenting guidance they receive.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black article-body__image--full"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/N7OYNJQ26RDHZCJGQWPLE3CUTU.jpg?auth=3e97e854f5261c6039826f44d6fdc93d7d67ab47b11b668acce822a34d705966&amp;amp;width=150" alt="President Donald Trump watches as Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch swears in Robert F.

That message, the agency said, helped consumers and motivated some to get the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cassidy-kennedy-trump-health-secretary-e826bc40fddf90829f6438681c5d9275" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://apnews.com/article/cassidy-kennedy-trump-health-secretary-e826bc40fddf90829f6438681c5d9275"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kennedy told senators he would not change&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the childhood vaccination schedule.

   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Jean Kaseya has a warning for the world: "We are playing with fire."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://africacdc.org/people/dr-jean-kaseya/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kaseya&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is director general of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He's talking about mpox, a virus that causes painful blisters and can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For much of the world, mpox — formerly known as monkeypox — seems like a virus from a few years ago. There was a global outbreak in 2022 and 2023 but the virus is no longer circulating as widely in Europe and the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, large swathes of Africa are in the midst of a major outbreak. The epicenter is in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with more than 2,000 suspected cases reported each week for months, according to Africa CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;There seemed to be encouraging news at the end of January, when the number of new cases dropped suddenly. But mpox trackers are not celebrating.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This decrease in terms of cases is not the reality," says Kaseya. Instead, he says, this is a sign that the ability to monitor and tally new cases has been interrupted. He attributes this to two things: "The combination between insecurity [and] lack of funding."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The insecurity he's referring to is in eastern DRC – a hotspot in the mpox outbreak – where rebel forces have taken control of key areas. The violence has interrupted mpox control and reporting work.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The lack of funding is the result of the abrupt &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/reevaluating-and-realigning-united-states-foreign-aid/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;freeze in U.S. foreign aid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; instituted after President Trump took office on Jan. 20, along with the decision to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/02/23/g-s1-50398/usaid-employees-leave" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fire or place on leave&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; most of the 10,000 people working for the U.S. Agency for International Development. Almost all of the agency's work has stalled, including critical parts of the mpox response effort. Trump also ordered the U.S. to leave the World Health Organization and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/29/nx-s1-5276340/trump-centers-for-disease-control-cdc-world-health-organization" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stop communicating with WHO officials&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who have played a critical role in mpox containment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's like watching a train wreck in real time – and not being able to do a thing about it," says a health worker formerly part of the U.S. response team. The worker spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The outlook before Trump's inauguration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The global community rallied after both Africa CDC and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/08/14/g-s1-16977/mpox-public-health-emergency-world-health-organization-who" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;WHO&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; declared the mpox outbreak in Africa a public health emergency in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over a billion dollars was pledged to the control effort by countries across Africa and Europe as well as Japan and the U.S., according to Africa CDC. President Biden promised $500 million as well as a million mpox vaccine doses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The hope was to stop this outbreak of the virus and prevent it from spreading to other parts of the world. However, the DRC can be a challenging place to fight an infectious disease. It's an enormous country with poor road networks and a hot spot in the outbreak is in the war-torn east where overcrowded camps for displaced people are common. The mpox virus spreads through sexual contact as well as close contact, even via bed sheets.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. plays an outsized role in the public health of the DRC. Last year, the U.S. provided &lt;a href="https://fts.unocha.org/countries/52/summary/2024" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;almost 70%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of all humanitarian aid&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;going to the country, sending $965,000,000 to the DRC according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. And when it came to mpox response, the U.S. funds have supported a wide range of efforts from training lab technicians to providing diagnostic tests to supplying gloves and gowns for health workers to working with veterinarians for disease surveillance in animal populations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then, in late January, the campaign to quash the virus was interrupted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A turning point — for the worse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On January 27, M23 — a rebel group that the United Nations says is backed by Rwanda — swept into Goma, a city in the eastern DRC that has been a hub for disease response efforts. Intense fighting engulfed the city for several days and early U.N. estimates suggest a few thousand people were killed.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"From one day to another, everything just collapsed," says Paulin Nkwosseu, chief of field operations for UNICEF in the DRC. UNICEF is the humanitarian agency funded and operated by the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nkwosseu, who was traveling when the violence erupted, says the violence didn't just pause mpox response efforts. It likely made the outbreak significantly worse. That's because the vast majority of mpox patients in isolation wards fled to seek shelter from the fighting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"After the fighting erupted, we managed to locate only 15 [mpox patients]. So the rest are probably living within the community with a huge, huge risk of contamination," says Nkwosseu. "This is a very big risk in terms of public health."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Africa CDC reports that at least 400 mpox patients fled.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nkwosseu adds that the risk of spreading the virus is particularly big because the fighting meant many people lost access to clean water or electricity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even if aid workers could locate all the mpox patients who fled, Nkwosseu says, it's unclear where they would now go to be isolated and make sure they don't spread the disease to others. "Six of the seven mpox treatment centers have been looted and totally destroyed, including two supported by UNICEF," he says. "All the stocks of supplies, treatment, medicines, mattresses, tents — everything was looted."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Mike Ryan, director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Program, says the violence has been a major setback. "All of the investment we've made over the last number of months to establish mpox surveillance, mpox control, mpox vaccinations – all of that is interrupted, on hold and impossible to continue," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'Flying blind'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At the same time as the security situation in eastern DRC deteriorated, President Trump froze almost all U.S. foreign assistance. While a judge has ruled that the funds should start flowing again and the administration has issued waivers for certain "lifesaving activities" — including the campaign against mpox — the aid world has faced major upheavals, with abrupt stop work orders and terminated contracts.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Public health experts say there are at least two areas where the impacts of the aid freeze are already being felt on the mpox response.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;First, the vast majority of the mpox vaccines pledged by the U.S. are stuck in a warehouse. While the vaccines were donated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, USAID was facilitating the transfer to the DRC. And so the stop work orders halted the process, according to an individual who was working on the process and spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In order for the vaccine donation to continue in the DRC, this individual says, HHS needs to release the vaccines – which involves the Trump administration affirming the donation – and USAID leadership needs to approve for funds to be dispersed to partners who would then help pay for the operational costs associated with the vaccine transfer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Second, the U.S. had been funding the secure transportation of suspected mpox samples from clinics to labs for testing — but no longer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We are scaling up the equipment for laboratory capacity, but the transportation of samples has become a nightmare," says&lt;a href="https://africacdc.org/people/dr-ngashi-ngongo/" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Dr. Ngashi Ngongo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, head of Africa CDC's incident management support team based in DRC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ngongo says his team has documented a steep drop in the testing rate — the portion of suspected cases where there is testing to confirm the diagnosis — even in parts of the country where violence has not disrupted mpox response efforts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The U.S., in particular, had been putting a lot of funding and effort into strengthening this surveillance. Without this piece, you're blind. You're flying blind in outbreak response," says an individual who had worked on the U.S. response and requested anonymity for fear of retribution.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There has been a waiver granted by the U.S. government for mpox response to continue despite the freeze in foreign aid. NPR obtained an internal memo sent to USAID staff from Mark Lloyd, who was performing the duties of assistant administrator for the USAID Bureau for Global Health. On Feb. 13, he wrote that rapid emergency response is continuing for diseases like mpox. "This includes detection, prevention, and containment efforts ... such as the following activities: risk information for affected populations, active surveillance, infection prevention and control, support for testing, case management and treatment, and supply of medical countermeasures."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;However, restarting such activities has proved difficult. The payments have not resumed for mpox response, there are currently no American staff at the USAID mission in the capital of the DRC and Trump's order for the CDC officials not to communicate with WHO is still in place.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The White House did not respond to requests for comment, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declined an interview request. The press line at USAID rang busy. NPR sent a request for comment to the State Department — Secretary of State Marco Rubio is acting administrator of USAID; the questions covered vaccine donations, transport of suspected mpox samples and the impact of disruptions in U.S. aid on the mpox outbreak. The request was not answered in time for our publication deadline.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's not just mpox that is being impacted, public health experts warn, but a whole host of health threats that the DRC is confronting right now, from measles to cholera to widespread malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kaseya worries the deteriorating health situations could "be an entry point for a new pandemic," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"DRC has a very fragile health system, and USAID is an integral part of this fabric that is already stretched very, very thin," says Anne Rimoin, a professor of epidemiology at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, who has worked on mpox in the DRC for decades.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Without U.S. support, there will be "disastrous setbacks" for health in the DRC and because diseases don't respect borders, she worries, those setbacks could be felt elsewhere in the world, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Selenium is a nutrient that plays a &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Selenium-HealthProfessional/"&gt;crucial role in human health&lt;/a&gt;, contributing to the thyroid and immune function, DNA repair, and cardiovascular and cognitive health. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It acts as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/add-antioxidants-to-your-diet/art-20546814"&gt;an antioxidant&lt;/a&gt; – substances that protect cells from unstable molecules that can damage DNA, proteins and cell membranes. It can even protect against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selenium is a vital &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK218751/"&gt;trace element&lt;/a&gt; found in living organisms, soil and plants, and your body needs only a small amount of it to function. The recommended dietary allowance for selenium in adults is &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Selenium-HealthProfessional/"&gt;55 micrograms per day&lt;/a&gt;, with an upper limit of 400 micrograms. In comparison, adults need between 900 to 10,000 micrograms daily of &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Copper-Consumer/"&gt;copper, another trace element&lt;/a&gt;, and between &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/zinc-Consumer/"&gt;8,000 to 40,000 micrograms&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/zinc-is-a-metal-essential-to-life-scienti-have-discovered-a-protein-that-helps-keep-cells-alive-when-zinc-levels-are-low-183083"&gt;trace element zinc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An excess or deficiency of selenium can have significant health consequences. In my work as a &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yI9ON-UAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;pharmaceutical science researcher&lt;/a&gt;, my colleagues and I study the potential use of selenium to boost the effectiveness of chemotherapy for cancer treatment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A dose of selenium&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selenium was &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Selenium"&gt;first discovered in 1817&lt;/a&gt; by chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius while analyzing an impurity in a batch of sulfuric acid produced in a factory in Sweden. Berzelius initially thought the material was the element tellurium, but he eventually realized that it was actually an unknown substance at the time. He named the mineral after &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Selene-Greek-and-Roman-mythology"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;, the Greek goddess of the Moon, because of its similarity to &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Tellurium"&gt;tellurium&lt;/a&gt;, which had been named after the Roman goddess of the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selenium exists in both organic and inorganic forms. &lt;a href="https://openstax.org/books/anatomy-and-physiology-2e/pages/2-5-organic-compounds-essential-to-human-functioning"&gt;Organic compounds&lt;/a&gt; contain carbon atoms and are typically derived from living organisms, while &lt;a href="https://openstax.org/books/anatomy-and-physiology-2e/pages/2-4-inorganic-compounds-essential-to-human-functioning"&gt;inorganic compounds&lt;/a&gt; do not have carbon atoms and generally originate from nonliving sources. Your cells chemically &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23042215"&gt;convert between these forms&lt;/a&gt; to carry out various physiological functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selenium deficiency is a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482260/"&gt;significant health issue&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in regions with selenium-poor soils, such as parts of China, Africa and Europe. Low selenium levels are associated with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.200700330"&gt;Keshan disease&lt;/a&gt;, a fatal heart condition, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2024.1402559"&gt;Kashin-Beck disease&lt;/a&gt;, which affects joints and bones. Deficiency also weakens immune function, increasing susceptibility to infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/650677/original/file-20250221-44-wf9bit.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Brazil nuts contain particularly high levels of selenium.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/brazil-nuts-royalty-free-image/2168604248"&gt;R.Tsubin/Moment via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consuming too much selenium is also an issue. Oversupplementation or excess environmental exposure can lead to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/archinternmed.2009.495"&gt;selenosis, a condition&lt;/a&gt; with symptoms such as brittle hair and nails, digestive issues, skin rashes and neurological symptoms such as irritability and fatigue. In severe cases, selenium toxicity can result in organ failure and death. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selenium has a narrow &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/therapeutic-index"&gt;therapeutic window&lt;/a&gt;, which is the dosage range that provides safe and effective treatment with minimal harmful side effects. For example, selenium can either increase or decrease your body’s &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1385/BTER:81:3:189"&gt;immune function&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the dose. Adequate levels of selenium &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/jn.109.120725"&gt;strengthen your immune cells’&lt;/a&gt; ability to fight infections and tumors, while excessive selenium intake can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.200700330"&gt;suppress immune responses&lt;/a&gt; by damaging immune tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Selenium and cancer prevention&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selenium may have the potential to treat and prevent cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long studied selenium’s role in cancer prevention. Initially suspected to be a carcinogen, later studies found it had &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23042215"&gt;protective effects against liver damage&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1960s. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1945904/"&gt;researchers proposed&lt;/a&gt; that selenium could be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1079/PNS2005467"&gt;used to prevent cancer&lt;/a&gt;, a concept that gained further traction in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, large-scale clinical trials have produced mixed results. The &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/prostate/research/select-trial-results-qa"&gt;Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial&lt;/a&gt; was a study of over 35,500 men that ran from 2001 to 2004. They found that taking selenium daily &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2008.864"&gt;did not reduce prostate cancer risk&lt;/a&gt; and may even &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djt456"&gt;increase the risk of prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt; in men with already high selenium levels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Findings from a study conducted from 1983 to 1996, the &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/11/7/630/252474/Baseline-Characteristics-and-the-Effect-of"&gt;Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial&lt;/a&gt;, suggested selenium may &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.15460"&gt;protect against prostate and other cancers&lt;/a&gt;. But researchers also observed a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djg061"&gt;heightened incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer&lt;/a&gt; among participants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These conflicting results may be due to the different forms of selenium each study tested, as well as differences in baseline selenium levels among participants. Other studies have found that selenium-contaminated water in a municipality of Italy has been &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/7/10/853/109604/Excess-melanoma-incidence-in-a-cohort-exposed-to"&gt;linked to an increased risk of melanoma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;

            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The antioxidant effects of selenium vary depending on its dose.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2021.07.013"&gt;Razaghi et al./EJC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Selenium and cancer treatment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selenium may also have the potential to stop cancer from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My research focuses on the potential of using selenium to supplement chemotherapy for cancer treatment. Selenium compounds such as methylseleninic acid, or MSA, and seleno-L-methionine, or SLM, show promise in targeting proteins that drive tumor progression and treatment resistance. Studies from my team and I have found that MSA can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctarc.2025.100864"&gt;modulate key biochemical pathways&lt;/a&gt; related to kidney cancer by reducing levels of proteins that influence tumor growth and immune evasion. We also observed that SLM may &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctarc.2025.100864"&gt;slow kidney tumor growth&lt;/a&gt; in mice without toxic side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More significantly, in a Phase 1 clinical trial, we found that &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article-abstract/doi/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-24-3234/751353/Phase-I-Clinical-Trial-of-High-Doses-of-Seleno-L"&gt;combining SLM with the chemotherapy drug axitinib&lt;/a&gt; was effective in treating metastatic kidney cancer in patients, with minimal side effects. Of the 27 patients we treated, over half saw their tumors shrink in size, with a median overall survival of nearly 20 months. These findings suggest that selenium may have a synergistic effect on chemotherapy by making it more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further investigation into how selenium may help overcome treatment resistance and what doses are optimal will clarify its potential as a viable addition to cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Striking the right balance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether as an immune booster or potential treatment for disease, the significance of selenium in human health is undeniable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.12748"&gt;selenium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; – such as Brazil nuts, seafood, whole grains and eggs – can help sustain optimal nutrient levels. In regions with selenium-deficient soils, supplementation with medical supervision may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fine line between benefit and harm underscores the importance of balanced intake and personalized approaches to selenium supplementation. As research continues, I believe selenium’s multifaceted role in health will become more clear.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

These bacteria mutate to resist even the most powerful antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently at a hospital in Nevada, a female patient who was admitted with pneumonia died from sepsis and multiple organ failure. The culprit was a bacteria that had adapted to resist as many as 26 different antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-possible-solution"&gt;A possible solution &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking steps in the fight against these deadly pathogens, researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Texas A&amp;amp;M&lt;/a&gt; have discovered something intriguing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts found that curcumin, the compound that gives &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/turmeric-supplements-provide-yet-another-health-benefit-according-to-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;turmeric&lt;/a&gt; its bright yellow color, may be able to reverse antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study revealed that curcumin, when presented to bacteria as a source of food and then triggered by light, causes destructive reactions within these microbes. These reactions eventually kill the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process effectively reduces the number of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-create-viruses-to-combat-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibiotic-resistant&lt;/a&gt; strains, consequently making conventional antibiotics useful again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-superbug-era"&gt;The superbug era&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the discovery of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/antibiotics-for-childhood-infections-are-becoming-ineffective/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;, infectious diseases were the top cause of death and disability globally. The introduction of these wonder drugs added 23 years to the average human &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/breathing-less-oxygen-could-extend-your-lifespan-by-50-or-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lifespan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the development of new antibiotics has reached a plateau, resistant bacteria have surged – ushering in the superbug era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Superbugs include methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant &lt;em&gt;Enterococcus&lt;/em&gt; (VRE), and certain drug-resistant strains of pneumonia-causing bacteria – all of which are notoriously difficult to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vanderlei Bagnato, a professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and the senior author of the study, shared his insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When bacteria start becoming resistant to conventional antibiotics, we have what we call an antibiotic catastrophe,” said Dr. Bagnato.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To overcome this challenge, we need alternative ways to either kill the superbugs or find a novel way to modify natural processes within the bacteria so that antibiotics start to act again.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-battling-the-superbugs"&gt;Battling the superbugs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural diversity within a bacterial population results in varied behaviors, including differences in antibiotic resistance. If certain strains can withstand antimicrobial drugs and continue to multiply, this diversity can contribute to increased resistance to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary goal of the Texas A&amp;amp;M study was to control this bacterial diversity to manage resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team applied a method known as photodynamic inactivation, which uses light and light-sensitive molecules known as photosensitizers to generate reactive oxygen species. These species can annihilate microorganisms by disrupting their metabolic processes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their experiments, curcumin was used as the photosensitizer. The beauty of this approach is that curcumin also doubles as natural food for bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tested this method on strains of &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; that are resistant to antibiotics such as amoxicillin, erythromycin, and gentamicin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria were subjected to multiple light exposure cycles. The team then compared the minimum antibiotic concentration needed to kill the bacteria following light exposure with those not exposed to light. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we have a mixed population of bacteria where some are resistant, we can use photodynamic inactivation to narrow the bacterial distribution, leaving behind strains that are more or less similar in their response to antibiotics. It’s much easier now to predict the precise antibiotic dose needed to remove the infection,” explained Dr. Bagnato.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-fight-against-resistance"&gt;The fight against resistance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are confident that photodynamic inactivation by curcumin would function well as a complement to antibiotics as a treatment for infections that are caused by drug-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Photodynamic inactivation offers a cost-effective treatment option, which is crucial for reducing medical expenses not only in developing countries but also in the United States,” said study co-author Dr. Vladislav Yakovlev. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also has potential applications in military medicine, where this technology could be used to treat battlefield wounds and prevent the development and spread of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/antimicrobial-resistance-projected-to-kill-10-million-people-each-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antimicrobial resistance&lt;/a&gt;, a significant concern in combat situations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study provide renewed hope in the fight against superbugs. By leveraging the potential of a common spice like turmeric, we may gain an advantage in this ongoing battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-79743-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 13:27:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNT1NkVFVUZWltTC1UWXdTTEJwVzBsT3c0c0t0WDdISnlhaERyRG5CMTB0QmYtNFdidVFJdlBkX2lSVndya0xFeFVYV3ptU0dwNERIWXRWbk1tbDJydGR1dUt5TzRfUGdxelFMWEY4NF91R1UwVzcyaE94MzV4Yl82a3dqWnhYdDA</guid></item><item><title>Adverse Childhood Experiences Impact Brain Development and Mental Health - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxPbHBGclMyVkZTc1dQRWM3ZkJ3NlhnRFB1S0pNSWJIcGpyYXhTTGpFSjBITHp6S24wOUlXVzNRN1cyVzdIb0k0dG5QN1FSNEloM3pNUHJaMjFET3N2M2laWllFNTFaVEZJbGFRZTJpQTVLY09XUWJmdjQ2X1hGRHNROFd3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A decade-long study reveals how childhood adversity alters brain development, increasing risks for mental health disorders and substance use. Researchers found that teens who experienced early adversity showed delayed cognitive control, with unusual brain activity in regions linked to self-regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connectivity between key brain regions was a stronger predictor of substance use than behavioral control, suggesting neural patterns may indicate future risk. Despite these challenges, the brain’s resilience offers hope, as cognitive control function often improves in late adolescence, highlighting opportunities for early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adversity and Brain Development:&lt;/strong&gt; Early life adversity is linked to delayed brain maturation in areas responsible for focus and self-control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Substance Use Prediction:&lt;/strong&gt; Brain connectivity patterns, rather than behavioral control, were stronger predictors of future substance use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential for Recovery:&lt;/strong&gt; Delayed cognitive control in early adolescence often improves over time, suggesting the brain’s resilience to adversity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While researchers have long spotlighted the role childhood abuse, poverty, and substance use play in human development, Virginia Tech’s Jungmeen Kim-Spoon is pulling back the curtain on what actually happens inside the brains of the young adults affected. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past 10 years, Kim-Spoon and her colleague Brooks Casas have co-led a research team that has tracked the brain function of teens. They found adolescents who experienced early life adversity showed unusual brain activity during tasks that require focus and self-control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture decoding="async" class="wp-image-107941"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a young girl and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Some of the group’s findings also illustrate the brain’s resiliency. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding suggests delayed development in certain areas of the brain, which is linked to higher risks for mental health disorders in early adulthood and future substance use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that early adverse experiences not only predict and impact mental health such as depression and anxiety, but also affect brain development,” said Kim-Spoon, professor of psychology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first-of-its-kind study recently resulted in two published journal articles, one in &lt;em&gt;Development and Psychopathology&lt;/em&gt; and another in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging&lt;/em&gt;. The former discusses findings related to maltreatment, brain development related to cognitive control, and psychopathology. The latter focuses on connectivity between neural circuits of the brain as a predictor of substance use initiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jungmeen said that despite the well documented connection between adverse experiences and the development of mental health disorders, the lack of available information on exactly how adolescents are impacted internally motivated the research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By age 18, more than half of adults in the United States have experienced at least one type of adversity,” said Kim-Spoon, who is also director of the&lt;a href="https://jklifespan.wixsite.com/mysite"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;JK Lifespan Development Lab at Virginia Tech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yet our understanding about how adverse experiences may alter the ways in which the brain and nervous system change over time, increasing vulnerability to mental health and substance use disorders, remains vastly insufficient.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and her collaborators set out to investigate this by recruiting adolescents from rural, suburban, and urban communities in Southwest Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 10 years, they tracked participant brain function, neural precursors – neurobiological markers in the developing brain – and other developmental check points through annual MRI scanning, questionnaires, and neurocognitive testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team includes: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Casas, professor with the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC and the Department of Psychology of the Virginia Tech College of Science&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The late Warren Bickel, professor with the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute and the Department of Psychology of the College of Science&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stephen LaConte, professor with the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute and the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Mechanics of the College of Engineering at Virginia Tech&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tae-Ho Lee, associate professor of psychology at Virginia Tech   &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kirby Deater-Deckard, professor of psychological and brain sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants’ family dynamics, decision-making skills, substance use initiation and frequency, personality factors, and social relationships were also assessed yearly with the goal of providing a well-rounded view of the factors impacting the adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Jungmeen and I get to tackle thorny problems while pursuing answers to questions that matter for promoting healthier youth development,” Deater-Deckard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our team utilizes state-of-the-art quantitative modeling techniques to integrate complex arrays of data from many sources such as surveys, observations, and brain imaging. She has helped me understand the complex changes in health and functioning over time.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also annually observed adolescents with no prior history of substance use in the same study sample from ages 14 to 21 over a period of seven years. Their findings suggest brain connectivity — the pattern of connections between different parts of the brain — rather than cognitive control behavior — the ability to adapt your behavior to meet your goals, and to override automatic responses — was the stronger predictor of future substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, stronger connectivity between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex — two brain regions that are crucial to cognitive control — was associated with delayed substance use onset, and this connectivity pattern showed a significant drop one year prior to substance use initiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the group’s findings also illustrate the brain’s resiliency. Although cognitive control brain functioning is delayed in early adolescence following childhood maltreatment, the findings suggest it often “catches up” during middle to late adolescence, suggesting neural plasticity and opportunities to help these young people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By conducting more research on neural plasticity during adolescence, we can shed light on the brain’s potential as a target for preventive interventions, aimed at promoting resilient functioning in young people facing adversity,” Kim-Spoon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fueled by these results and supported by several grants from the National Institutes of Health to Kim-Spoon and Casas as well as the Virginia Tech Institute for Society, Culture and Environment, Kim-Spoon and the research team plans to continue this study for another five years. As the participants enter their 20s, the team will focus more on examining their relationships, networks, and social environments to understand how they contribute to the ways young people navigate unique challenges in early adulthood.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This longitudinal project has been very rewarding especially in terms of collaborating with brilliant minds within Virginia Tech and outside,” Kim-Spoon said. “It has been fun to look into the things we can do to help young people develop healthier, and it will be interesting to see what we will find in the next few years.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By expanding this research, Kim-Spoon and her collaborators can contribute to the development of effective resilience and protective strategies to help people at higher risk of developing mental health and addiction problems improve their future well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim-Spoon said she believes we are just beginning to better understand the factors affecting young people’s mental health, substance use, and well-being by examining how brain function and development interact with social and emotional dynamics, and spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adverse experiences, no matter how we view them, are tough, but there are things we can do to help these young people develop healthier, such as access to parental support, education, and positive experiences with peer groups,” Kim-Spoon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurodevelopment and childhood adversity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#85e8eee4f6ede7f0f7ebc5f3f1abe0e1f0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Margaret Ashburn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://vt.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Margaret Ashburn – Virginia Tech&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orignial Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954579424000531" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Psychopathology as long-term sequelae of maltreatment and socioeconomic disadvantage: Neurocognitive development perspectives&lt;/a&gt;” by Kim-Spoon et al. &lt;em&gt;Development and Psychopathology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2024.11.020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neural Signatures of Cognitive Control Predict Future Adolescent Substance Use Onset and Frequency&lt;/a&gt;” by Kim-Spoon et al.&lt;em&gt; Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Signatures of Cognitive Control Predict Future Adolescent Substance Use Onset and Frequency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0015"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adolescent substance use is a significant predictor of future addiction and related disorders. Understanding neural mechanisms underlying substance use initiation and frequency during adolescence is critical for early prevention and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0020"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current longitudinal study followed 91 substance-naïve adolescents annually for 7 years from ages 14 to 21 years to identify potential neural precursors that predict substance use initiation and frequency. Cognitive control processes were examined using the Multi-Source Interference Task to assess functional neural connectivity. A questionnaire was used to assess substance use frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stronger connectivity between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) at time 1 predicted a delayed onset of substance use, indicative of a protective effect. A notable decline in this dACC–dlPFC connectivity was observed 1 year prior to substance use initiation. Conversely, lower connectivity of the dACC with the supplementary motor area and heightened connectivity of the anterior insula with the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and angular gyrus were predictive of greater frequency of future substance use. These findings remained after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic covariates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0030"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study highlights the critical role of cognitive control–related neural connectivity in predicting substance use initiation and frequency during adolescence. The results imply that efforts to strengthen and monitor the development of the top-down cognitive control system in the brain from early adolescence can be protective and deter progression into problematic substance use. Furthermore, for adolescents with heightened frequency of substance use, interventions may prove more effective by targeting interoceptive processes in cognitive control training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychopathology as long-term sequelae of maltreatment and socioeconomic disadvantage: Neurocognitive development perspectives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience research underscores the critical impact of adverse experiences on brain development. Yet, there is limited understanding of the specific pathways linking adverse experiences to accelerated or delayed brain development and their ultimate contributions to psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we present new longitudinal data demonstrating that neurocognitive functioning during adolescence, as affected by adverse experiences, predicts psychopathology during young adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample included 167 participants (52% male) assessed in adolescence and young adulthood. Adverse experiences were measured by early maltreatment experiences and low family socioeconomic status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive control was assessed by neural activation and behavioral performance during the Multi-Source Interference Task. Psychopathology was measured by self-reported internalizing and externalizing symptomatology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results indicated that higher maltreatment predicted heightened frontoparietal activation during cognitive control, indicating delayed neurodevelopment, which, in turn predicted higher internalizing and externalizing symptomatology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, higher maltreatment predicted a steeper decline in frontoparietal activation across adolescence, indicating neural plasticity in cognitive control-related brain development, which was associated with lower internalizing symptomatology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results elucidate the crucial role of neurocognitive development in the processes linking adverse experiences and psychopathology. Implications of the findings and directions for future research on the effects of adverse experiences on brain development are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 13:23:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPbHBGclMyVkZTc1dQRWM3ZkJ3NlhnRFB1S0pNSWJIcGpyYXhTTGpFSjBITHp6S24wOUlXVzNRN1cyVzdIb0k0dG5QN1FSNEloM3pNUHJaMjFET3N2M2laWllFNTFaVEZJbGFRZTJpQTVLY09XUWJmdjQ2X1hGRHNROFd3</guid></item><item><title>'I’m 92 and feel 50 – here’s the workout routine I swear by, and how to get started in your 60s' - Women's Health UK</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxOaV9fVVRTU0ZWeE1NUjNZVW4tM3hxbF9hY2NkNE16QW5UbE9lb1lyQnhNYlFVN2FUVi1aU1l0bmpTcnhFdmJ6Mm9EdlRSS3NiV3cyZmd5SzdrWmNWTGRTdXVNbERWT3lvdWYyYUg5ejlocnA3ZFdieVp3ZTB4dU5WUVpSeUg2TjhwdVJXMTN6Ym5jMVJEQl9V?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-j4k1z9 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Imagine being 92 and driving yourself to the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/fitness/strength-training/a705924/best-gyms-in-london/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/fitness/strength-training/a705924/best-gyms-in-london/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="gym" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt; four days a week, doing deep &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/fitness/strength-training/a708464/how-to-squat-properly/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/fitness/strength-training/a708464/how-to-squat-properly/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="squats" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/fitness/a39595079/25-7-2-workout/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/fitness/a39595079/25-7-2-workout/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="climbing the stairs" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;climbing the stairs&lt;/a&gt; with ease.

Her daughter shared a video of Giordano’s full mobility routine, including a supine hamstring stretch, figure four glute stretch, modified pigeon stretch, supine lower back stretch, bridge walks, roll-ups, butterfly groin stretch, and sit-to-stands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;She starts every strength training workout with dynamic mobility exercises to prime the muscles she's about to work (like leg swings and deep squats before a lower-body strength session, as seen in the video of Giordano's park workout above), and finishes with static stretches targeting the same muscles. Studies show that static stretches are more beneficial when performed in a cooldown (as opposed to a warmup) as they can benefit muscle recovery by reducing stiffness and decreasing DOMS, while other &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274517864_Acute_Changes_in_Autonomic_Nerve_Activity_during_Passive_Static_Stretching" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274517864_Acute_Changes_in_Autonomic_Nerve_Activity_during_Passive_Static_Stretching" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="research" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that static stretching after a workout downregulates your nervous system and activates the parasympathetic response, making you feel calmer after training. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;In the caption, Radtke writes: ‘My mum’s incredibly youthful mobility didn’t happen overnight.

She says she always takes the stairs, stays active throughout the day, and looks for opportunities to bolster her mobility.

It’s treated with a vast number of methods, from ear lavage to local anesthetics, &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/antidepressants-could-significantly-improve-brain-function-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antidepressants&lt;/a&gt;, antihistamines, antipsychotics, and sedatives, with different results.” The lack of a consistent solution underscores the urgent need for better treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, Panhóca and his team conducted an extensive study on alternative and complementary therapies. Over four weeks, they examined treatment responses in more than 100 individuals aged 18 to 65. Participants, randomly assigned to ten groups, received different therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings offer strong evidence that low-level laser therapy and photobiomodulation outperform conventional treatments. By targeting affected areas with precise light wavelengths, these methods appear to stimulate cellular repair and reduce tinnitus severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/breakthrough-drug-reverses-groin-hernias-without-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt;, which often produce inconsistent outcomes, light-based therapies provide a non-invasive alternative with minimal side effects. Researchers believe this approach could soon become a primary treatment option for tinnitus sufferers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These therapies included laser acupuncture, flunarizine dihydrochloride, Ginkgo biloba, and low-level laser stimulation of the internal auditory canal (transmeatal stimulation), both alone and in combination with various adjunct therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each patient underwent eight bi-weekly treatment sessions and was assessed using a "tinnitus handicap inventory questionnaire" featuring 25 questions. This questionnaire included a functional subscale with 11 questions addressing &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/brain-cells-that-control-anxiety-and-stress-related-mental-disorders-identified/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental, social, occupational, and physical limitations&lt;/a&gt; due to tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon analyzing the data, the researchers made several noteworthy discoveries. The most promising results were observed in patients treated with laser acupuncture alone and transmeatal low-power laser stimulation alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the latter group exhibited even greater improvement when the duration of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-treatment-for-heart-disease-uses-lasers-to-vaporize-blockages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;laser irradiation&lt;/a&gt; was extended from 6 to 15 minutes. Additionally, combinations of laser therapy with vacuum therapy or Ginkgo biloba, as well as laser acupuncture alone and flunarizine dihydrochloride alone, also demonstrated lasting therapeutic effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Barplot comparing the non-normalized TH1 scores at T0, T1 and T2 between tinnitus treatment modalities explored in this study (from G1 to G10).

We believe laser therapy can increase peripheral irrigation, which may be the main cause of the problem in many cases, as well as stimulating inner ear cell proliferation and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-invent-artificial-knee-cartilage-that-is-better-than-the-real-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;collagen production&lt;/a&gt;." These findings suggest that low-level laser therapy may address underlying factors contributing to tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="standardizing_treatment_protocols"&gt;Standardizing Treatment Protocols&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the efficacy of laser therapy in alleviating tinnitus is not entirely novel, the CEPOF study makes significant strides towards standardizing treatment protocols. This development holds great promise for healthcare professionals, including dentists, ear, nose, and throat specialists, and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/music-helps-patients-with-dementia-connect-with-loved-ones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;speech therapists&lt;/a&gt;, who treat tinnitus patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the literature lacks consensus on the optimal number of sessions and treatment intensity, making it challenging to provide consistent care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Comparison between study groups showing the evolution of different interventions to treat tinnitus.

This is part of the learning curve when you innovate in health treatments like this." Additionally, long-term effects of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-improve-short-term-memory-problems-through-laser-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;laser therapy&lt;/a&gt; must be thoroughly investigated to ensure its safety and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pioneering study received support from FAPESP, which awarded a postdoctoral scholarship to Dr. Fernanda Rossi Paolillo, a key contributor to the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While further research is necessary to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of laser therapy, these findings represent a significant step forward in the quest to alleviate the burden of tinnitus on those affected by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Brighter Side of News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 12:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNck5DbXY5cElsQnBFNFVTUUo5WWhkUll6RjVjNnpHM01Xd2JvS3N2MzRQZVVoWXpncWxVN3NPV09BNDJ1djdUVGtPdzJwcFhlMk9NTXlnZEdnSWlFQU44UnRBS1VDck16OW9IaVBBekVoS3QxNGlmbjQxSGs4WHo2aU5mQVhQdVRIbmRLMmJFTE9xblVXMy02dEpBMVhNQQ</guid></item><item><title>My Beverly Hills plastic surgeon let slip on what Ozempic REALLY does - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxNcEV2MENrb1dqb0ZDSUIzR1JEM3VDYzhmOWdmVW1LdURuVmVUZ2tsdHZVRDFZWU55RUp4NXVvV1pBalBkTzFuZDQxeTdpeWtuVzU5WXdJSW5vUHlUaVJFODZVVFpEOVk0bUQzck50OXNFZkM2Nl9PNHVtd1FscDR6aFdfeXpqdTExLWdMTTVLRTIwcXNFc2xhTmdEMUtjRENQUkxVS0ZsOVZZOXg4WTl2UXM3VW5fM1N0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other day I went to see a plastic surgeon who just happens to be Beverly Hills' best-kept secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You won't find him on &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/instagram/index.html" id="mol-55f9bfb0-f185-11ef-a1d7-855d0ee76b5a"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; — he doesn't do it.

And he's the &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;only&lt;/span&gt; person I trust to inject anything into my face (I'm a health expert, not a nun!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the needles penetrated my skin, we fell into our routine quarterly catch-up. The download began. Apparently, the so-called 'Ozempic Face' is real – and far worse than anyone thought, he told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From Hollywood's elites to suburban moms, Wall Street execs and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-55fd9040-f185-11ef-a1d7-855d0ee76b5a"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; influencers, Ozempic, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-55f86020-f185-11ef-a1d7-855d0ee76b5a"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; drug-turned-weight-loss sensation, has permeated every corner of our culture. The promise of effortless &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-55fe7aa0-f185-11ef-a1d7-855d0ee76b5a"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; is too intoxicating to resist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just look at the &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/tvshowbiz/article-14428333/Skinny-stars-SAG-Awards-Ozempic-craze.html"&gt;slew of underweight A-listers&lt;/a&gt; on the red carpet at Sunday’s &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/sag_awards/index.html" id="mol-c53446a0-f2b3-11ef-bd11-035a27bd339d"&gt;SAG Awards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;We're bombarded with stories of how what are known as GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic (and Mounjaro, Wegovy and the rest) are the new Holy Grail of health, offering myriad other benefits as the pounds fall off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But what is conveniently swept under the rug are the horror stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The potential side effects that are most commonly discussed — thyroid &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-54d04ed0-f2cd-11ef-93c9-d3c6e5676507" class="class"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, pancreatitis, stomach paralysis — should be enough to make anyone reconsider. But what if I told you that's just the warm-up act?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The other day I went to see a plastic surgeon who just happens to be Beverly Hills' best-kept secret. (pictured: Jillian Michaels).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Apparently, the so-called 'Ozempic Face' is real - and far worse than anyone thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;My plastic surgeon isn't the only clinician spilling the beans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I work with MDs and PhDs across every specialty — psychiatrists, gastroenterologists, cardiologists, nutrition scientists. Not one of them has failed to mention, in hushed tones, the 'observational adverse events' they see with GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Why whisper? Because questioning the safety of this medical 'miracle' is career suicide in today's climate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pharma-industrial complex, backed by regulatory bodies and media puppets, has turned medicine into a religion where blind faith replaces scientific debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of these 'whispered' potential side-effects you may have heard about: Ozempic Face, of course, but also hair loss and diminished libido.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Others, you likely haven't: gastric bezoars (hard indigestible masses that can form in the gut), or suicidal ideation, accelerated aging and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But to return to 'Ozempic Face': many have assumed that it's simply the result of reduced facial volume due to weight loss that leaves many people looking older than before. However, based on my extensive professional experience of helping people lose weight over the years, I've never seen them look older — only younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To be honest, I hadn't given this issue much thought, as I've been more focused on the potentially life-threatening side effects of the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That changed the day my surgeon told me his patients on GLP-1 medications were 'aging in fast-forward', with some looking a decade older in less than a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said, their skin didn't just &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;appear &lt;/span&gt;older — it was &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;behaving &lt;/span&gt;older, losing elasticity, with more wrinkles and crepiness, and healing more slowly. Even the connective tissue or SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System), which structurally supports the face, was becoming thinner and weaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It seems that GLP-1 drugs may be accelerating the breakdown of structural proteins like collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid at an alarming rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, I dug into the literature for answers and found a couple of studies suggesting GLP-1 drugs potentially deactivated fat-derived stem cells in the upper dermal layers. These stem cells play a crucial role in skin integrity, as they release messengers that stimulate fibroblasts to produce the key building blocks that maintain youthful, resilient skin. Yikes!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then there's the impact on the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Sabine Hazan, a gastroenterologist, warned me about the potential dangers of GLP-1 drugs delaying gastric emptying — a technical way of saying food lingers in the gut like a Thanksgiving dinner that never digests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She worried this could disrupt the gut microbiome, the trillions of microbes essential for digestion, immunity, and overall health. She also speculated that reduced gut motility might lead to conditions like SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth), a gruesome affliction that brings bloating, brain fog, mood swings, and makes one poo puddles of tar (&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;not &lt;/span&gt;hyperbole). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For one of my podcasts, I interviewed Dr. Heather Heying, PhD, who raised similar concerns. She pointed out that severely slowed gut motility could have long-term consequences, including a number of conditions that are associated with stomach cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once again, I went hunting through the literature for what other dangers might be being overlooked. What I found was terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Several studies have documented large gastric bezoars in patients on GLP-1 drugs. These dense lumps of food, mucus or medication residue harden into rock-like formations in the stomach. Think of them as the human equivalent of a clogged garbage disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;We're bombarded with stories of how what are known as GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic (and Mounjaro, Wegovy and the rest) are the new Holy Grail of health, offering myriad other benefits as the pounds fall off. But what is conveniently swept under the rug are the horror stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The conversation around these drugs is overwhelmingly focused on their benefits, while potentially serious risks are downplayed or dismissed. People deserve full, honest information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Left untreated, these bezoars grow, some swelling to the size of a grapefruit, causing unrelenting nausea, vomiting and intense abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In worst-case scenarios, they lead to life-threatening blockages, eroding the stomach lining, triggering infections, and may require surgical removal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Right when you think it couldn't get worse — caved-in faces and putrid balls of undigested sludge — a growing number of weight-loss jab users report yet another unexpected side effect: a plummeting libido.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Let's be real. Weight loss is supposed to boost your sex life, not destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of my go-to motivators for male contestants on the TV series &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The Biggest Loser&lt;/span&gt; was telling them their erections were about to get a serious upgrade. (Fun fact: for every 10-20 pounds lost, roughly half an inch of buried shaft is 'recovered'.) And thanks to improved cardiovascular function, blood flow increases make those erections stronger than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But here's the problem: Some men on Ozempic and other GLP-1 drugs are reporting alarming drops in testosterone and, well, difficulty getting it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women, meanwhile, are also experiencing plummeting libido, feeling disconnected from intimacy and joy itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Several psychiatrists I've interviewed suspect it stems from how these drugs alter the way dopamine (the brain's feel-good hormone) works, and how they appear to impact gut-brain communication and hormone balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By delaying gastric emptying and suppressing cravings, GLP-1 drugs blunt the brain's reward system, which controls not just food-seeking behavior but also motivation and pleasure — including sexual desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Changes in gut microbiome composition also affect neurotransmitter production, so it's no wonder some users find their sex drive plummeting. While some report a boost in confidence and energy as they lose weight, others have described feeling emotionally dulled, disinterested in intimacy, and even disconnected from joy itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of the day, I don't judge anyone who chooses the weight-loss jab path — everyone has the right to make decisions about their own body. But what is unacceptable is the lack of transparent conversation about the true trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The conversation around these drugs is overwhelmingly focused on their benefits, while potentially serious risks are downplayed or dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People should be having full, honest discussions so they can make the most educated decision for themselves — one that isn't clouded by all the hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because when the stakes are this high, no one should unknowingly enter into a bargain with the devil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This chart shows declining brain function scores among those taking SSRis (red line) and those not on antidepressants (blue line)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The effect was even greater for SSRIs specifically with scores declining by an extra 0.39 points per year and those on higher doses saw a decline of 0.42 points per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors said while this difference was large enough to observe the actual impact it would have on patients was clinically 'uncertain'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Publishing the results in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-025-03851-3#Sec9"&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists also found patients on antidepressants had a 7 per cent greater chance of death and 18 per cent greater risk of suffering a fracture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those on higher doses of SSRIs were 35 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with severe dementia, an 18 per cent higher chance of death, and a 25 per cent higher of breaking a bone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the experts added that they weren't able to pin these finding on the drugs themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said it was possible the poorer health outcomes were a result of the depression the drugs were meant to treat rather than the medication itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An additional finding was that a subset of dementia patients, those suffering from frontotemporal dementia, which typically strikes younger people, had a slower rate of disease progression when taking antidepressants.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Tara Spires-Jones, an expert in dementia and president of the British Neuroscience Association, said while the findings were 'strong' there were limitations and more research was needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;But they can also be a sign of dementia — the memory-robbing condition plaguing nearly 1million Brits and 7million Americans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Around 900,000 Britons are currently thought to have the memory-robbing disorder. But University College London scientists estimate this will rise to 1.7 million within two decades as people live longer. It marks a 40 per cent uptick on the previous forecast in 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People who needed antidepressants may have had more aggressive disease or the depression itself could have been affecting disease progression,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Previous studies have also reported mixed results, highlighting the need for more research before we have a full understanding of the effects of antidepressant use on dementia progression.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Richard Oakley, associate director for research and innovation of the Alzheimer’s Society, agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This study suggested that antidepressants led to faster rates of memory and thinking decline in people with dementia but it did not rule out the possibility that the changes were due to the presence of depression rather than antidepressant use, so further research is needed to understand the effects of antidepressants,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Prasad Nishtala, an expert in life sciences at the University of Bath, said the study also couldn't explain how antidepressants were accelerating cognitive decline and also called for further research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Because of these limitations, the study’s findings should be interpreted with caution and ideally replicated using other real-world data sources,' he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dementia affects an estimated one million people in the UK and has a variety of causes, such as Alzheimer's disease and reduced blood flow to the brain following a stroke, known as vascular dementia.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recent analysis by the &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-53328900-bdf6-11ef-9b24-67aee2c8b58d" class=""&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; Society estimated the overall annual cost of the dementia to the UK is £42billion a year, with families bearing the brunt. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;An ageing population means these costs – which include lost earnings of unpaid carers – are set to soar to £90billion in the next 15 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 944,000 in the UK are thought to be living with dementia while the figure is thought to be around 7million in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Memory problems, thinking and reasoning difficulties and language problems are common early symptoms of the condition, which then worsen over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate Alzheimer's Research UK analysis found 74,261 people died from dementia in 2022 compared with 69,178 a year earlier, making it the country's biggest killer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Each hour a person spends squinting into a smartphone or staring at a &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/eye-care/staring-at-screens-can-cause-eye-strain-heres-tips-to-prevent-that-2"&gt;screen&lt;/a&gt; increases their risk of nearsightedness, a new evidence review suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every daily one-hour increment in digital screen time is associated with 21% higher odds of myopia, researchers reported recently in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830598"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the risk continues to increase as more time each day is spent with screens, researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Myopia risk increased significantly from 1 to 4 hours of screen time and then rose more gradually thereafter,” the research team led by &lt;a href="https://snucm.elsevierpure.com/en/persons/y-kim-41"&gt;Young Kook Kim&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of ophthalmology with the Seoul National University College of Medicine in South Korea, wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk of nearsightedness is doubled for people who spend four or more hours with a screen every day, results show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review suggests a “potential safety threshold of less than 1 hour per day of exposure, with an increase in odds up to 4 hours,” the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2050, nearly one-half of the world’s population is expected to be nearsighted, researchers said in background notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearsightedness is when close-up objects look clear but distant objects appear blurry, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a nearsighted person can read a map but has trouble seeing well enough to drive a car without glasses or contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The projected surge in myopia cases is likely fueled by environmental factors prevalent in urbanized societies, with major contributors being increased near-vision activities and reduced outdoor time,” researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smartphones, tablets and other screens have “introduced new forms of near-work activity,” researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As children increasingly embrace smart devices at younger ages and spend more time on digital screens, there is an urgent need to better understand the association of digital screen time with myopia,” researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the new paper, researchers pooled data from 45 prior studies involving more than 335,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data showed a significant dose-response association. In other words, the more time people spent with screens, the greater their risk for nearsightedness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This risk is independent of other activities that require people to work their near vision, like reading or writing, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is also likely that digital screen use and other near-vision tasks collectively contribute to myopia risk, potentially influencing the overall dose-response trend,” researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that simply reducing screen time in favor of traditional near-vision activities may not be an effective prevention strategy,” researchers added. “A more effective approach to the mitigation of myopia risk would involve minimizing overall near-work activities while promoting increased outdoor time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

black tea brewed for five minutes reduced the concentration of lead ions in water by about 15%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While the team did not test the possible ramifications for health, Shindel said that even in a country such as the UK, where lead levels in drinking water are unlikely to be high, there could be a small effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It’s possible that on the margins, tea consumption is reducing [people’s] metal intake by a very small amount, and perhaps over the population of the UK, that’s reducing diseases associated with metal consumption by another commensurately very small amount,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Among other studies, previous research has suggested people who drink tea may have&lt;a

body link"&gt;ACS Food Science &amp;amp; Technology&lt;/a&gt;, Shindel and colleagues reported how they brewed tea with different batches of water containing known concentrations of heavy metal ions. They then checked the concentration of these ions after different periods of steeping, using solutions without tea as controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Working with black tea, they found the brew reduced the concentration of all the metal ions tested, including lead, chromium and cadmium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;They then focused on lead, finding longer brewing times of black tea and higher temperatures of water were associated with a greater reduction in the concentration of lead ions. What is more, ground tea had a greater effect than whole leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The team also found that, at least for the batches they tested, black, green and white teas reduced the concentration of lead ions in the water to a greater degree than camomile, rooibos and oolong teas when left to steep for 24 hours to reach equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In the case of bagged tea, the materials also mattered, with empty cellulose bags found to reduce the concentration of lead ions, whereas empty cotton and nylon bags did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Michelle Francl of Bryn Mawr College in the US and the author of Steeped: The Chemistry of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/tea" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Tea&lt;/a&gt;, who was not involved in the work, said: “If you are concerned about heavy metals in your water, don’t think that drinking tea is the solution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, she added that the study “suggests some interesting directions” for developing sustainable and accessible ways to “removing contaminants from water, a critical need in many parts of the world”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 12:14:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNVUxRaGF2RGtoSVRpWHlVY0FJVC1yWVFCdUlBSGdzNElPc0FfNEtvOHB5enlwbWJKeWJKcTlMNHc4MkxWMFkyZ1FScVdPNTUwdlZ5cDNwc0hmaWFGcE1yN0JRczJ1U2FaU1dDb19mUlQ1b0VVZlJjTXppdEFrSGJmQkM2OS1mVUdsN2VJX0U0b1FGOU5NaVpr</guid></item><item><title>With avian flu flying around, is it safe to enjoy eggs? - The Mercury News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQRHJ4ZHFIQXVvNDNhTU5PdEFiVjluZXdxRHk0YWdodU1GNnFYcl9pNVZrRTdHUklDSG1lOFNhUUtMTE1tWkRUcTc2M25CVmxEWU5ERjNhcGVxVjBBcWFoZnlGclNocHJjeEExeng0a291Nk9HalBQTUZhTXdmekdrUEloYm5QaVpPQjdIelgxZGxCVmZ0RlBXSdIBngFBVV95cUxPZDNSMllEblRFTm9qeVVZRDhJblpSTldwczBfRGJXQTUta2Ffb3NSdFdvSFFTSTZXMm1rZ2dtSUdBMmdEWlVEaXJVVE03clQ5Wk40cXFwREVnY1pNZ0dQYm9wV0N5R2MwYURUNUczRmlKX0RibmFmdi1WMmJzbXJ3NXRsSjlQRFdvdE5DcWdSdWtlRkQwTUEwdnN2WF9wQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy mng-subscriber-content"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/01/07/normal-egg-prices-months-away-analyst-says/"&gt;Ever-rising egg prices&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/02/10/trader-joes-and-costco-are-limiting-how-many-eggs-people-can-buy/"&gt;supply shortages,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.kmvt.com/2025/02/10/police-try-crack-case-after-more-than-500-eggs-stolen-restaurant/"&gt;egg thefts&lt;/a&gt; and reports of bodegas selling &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/egg-prices-bronx-bodegas/"&gt;loose eggs&lt;/a&gt; confirm strong demand for the kitchen staple even as avian flu infects and kills more of the birds that produce them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as consumers eat their breakfasts, they may wonder whether the health risk is increasing as the virus spreads to species beyond birds, prompting &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/bird-flu-cows-cats-human-transmission-7adf14ec"&gt;scientists to sound the alarm&lt;/a&gt; that the H5N1 virus is mutating faster than anyone might know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/02/22/san-jose-olivera-egg-ranch-bird/"&gt;San Jose’s Olivera Egg Ranch to close after 76 years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food safety experts maintain the risk of contracting bird flu by touching or consuming eggs remains very low. And despite a strain of bird flu &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-virus-type-h5n1-us-dairy-cattle"&gt;that has hit 747 dairy cattle herds in California alone,&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="http://Despite%20a%20more%20active%20outbreak%20of%20a%20new%20strain%20of%20bird%20flu%20that%20has%20hit%20cattle%20and%20dairy%20workers,%20and%20an%20announcement%20a%20year%20ago%20by%20the%20U.S.%20Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration%20(FDA)%20that%20the"&gt;announcement nearly a year ago by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; that one in five milk samples from grocery stores already tested positive for the virus, authorities say that non-raw milk products such as soft cheese and yogurt are safe for consumption as long as they have been pasteurized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given federal funding freezes, &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/02/19/gongloff-trumps-climate-data-purge-hurts-americans-health-and-wallets/"&gt;removal of scientific data and information from governmental websites&lt;/a&gt;, threats to future research, and an overall air of uncertainty surrounding public messaging by the new Trump administration, how can anyone be sure their risk is low?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maurice Ernest Pitesky, associate professor at UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine and an expert in disease modeling for avian flu, explains why it’s unlikely that you’ll get a bad egg. This interview has been lightly edited for grammar and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt;  Do U.S. Department of Agriculture or state inspectors test for bird flu inside the egg?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;No. When you get sick birds, that’s when the surveillance starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;So why shouldn’t we be worried about avian flu inside of eggs if not on the shell? For example, is it true that an infected bird doesn’t have time to lay another egg?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes. When laying hens get sick, they basically stop egg production. A couple scenarios could happen in &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt;. You could have an egg pop out right after the bird is infected. And maybe there’s feces on the egg and that feces has some of the virus on it. And maybe the virus gets inside the egg. But the virus is more in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tissue of birds. It’s not like milk, where the compartment where the animal produces the virus the most in is the milk-producing parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What if we were to end up getting the leftover eggs from infected flocks that had to be culled?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; If there was an infected house and there are a handful of those eggs and those eggs were exposed — Americans eat over a trillion eggs a year. That’s literally a drop in an ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have slightly differing advice on the minimum temperature at which to cook eggs in order to stay completely safe from contamination. The &lt;a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/safe-temperature-chart"&gt;FDA says 160 degrees Fahrenheit&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/prevention/food-safety.html"&gt;CDC says 165 degrees&lt;/a&gt;. Either way, this means cooking the egg all the way through, whether it’s a chicken, duck or quail egg, or a &lt;em&gt;balut &lt;/em&gt;fetal egg (duck or quail) designated as an ethnic egg product rather than a shell egg. But &lt;a href="https://eggsafety.org/faq/what-is-the-best-temperature-to-cook-an-egg/"&gt;many methods of common egg preparation&lt;/a&gt; fall below the recommended safety thresholds. Will indulging in sunny side-up eggs with pancakes, soft-boiled eggs in ramen, or raw eggs cracked into boiling soups at home or at a favorite restaurant lead to somewhat greater risk?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;You’re talking about an outlier scenario. So, could I be talking about steak tartare with an egg yolk on top of it that happened to have the virus in it? And then maybe you rub your eyes or something because human cases have been more conjunctival, as is the case in dairy farms? I would see that as such a low-risk event. I’m pretty cautious as a scientist and also as a parent, and even now, I don’t see it as a major risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;For people who get their eggs from a noncommercial source, such as their own backyard flock: Is it a good idea to wash egg shells off at home?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; No. I tell people &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to wash their eggs, because most of the ways that people wash them have the potential to drive bacteria back into the egg. Don’t wash the eggs but make sure the eggs are being laid right in the nest box, collect them at least every 24 to 36 hours, and refrigerate them right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;So we really don’t have to worry at all about eggs and bird flu?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s biology, so it’s hard to say, “No, that’s never going to happen,” but I’d worry more about salmonella than I would about getting avian flu from table eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, a salmonella outbreak in eggs &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/outbreak-investigation-salmonella-eggs-sept-2024#:~:text=As%20of%20October%2017%2C%202024,Wisconsin%2C%20Illinois%2C%20and%20Michigan."&gt;sickened 93 people across 12 states&lt;/a&gt;. Three of the egg consumers affected resided in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pitesky is far more concerned about the impacts of backyard flocks and their owners’ behaviors on the outbreak. Hobbyists with chickens that happen to lay eggs are not subject to the same regulations as commercial egg producers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other things at the top of Pitesky’s mind are the &lt;a href="http://dir.ca.gov/dosh/dosh_publications/BirdFluFactSheet-Workers.pdf"&gt;occupational hazards faced by dairy workers&lt;/a&gt; and “cats infected with raw milk and raw turkey from infected carcasses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the biggest issue is that the virus is now zoonotic — we’re having more and more humans that have been infected,” he said. “We’re really worried about it being human-to-human transmission eventually.”&lt;/p&gt;

At higher doses in particular, it can cause an upset stomach, nausea and diarrhea. However, most people tolerate it well, especially by going to a lower dose and building back up, says Thangudu. Plus, it shouldn’t be taken by those with liver or kidney disease, heart failure or type 1 diabetes, according to the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/metformin-oral-route/description/drg-20067074#drug-before-using" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="why-are-telehealth-providers-prescribing-metformin-for-weight-loss"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are telehealth providers prescribing metformin for weight loss?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite its modest weight loss effects, Hims &amp;amp; Hers offers metformin for exactly that purpose. A bit of weight loss is not an uncommon side effect of the medication, &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:14;pos:1" class="link " href="https://profiles.howard.edu/oluwaranti-akiyode" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ranti Akiyode;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:14;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Ranti Akiyode&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of pharmacy practice at Howard University College of Pharmacy, tells Yahoo Life. But it wouldn’t usually be a go-to treatment for weight loss, she says. For that reason, “the big concern is the expectations that [prescribers like Hims &amp;amp; Hers] are setting up for patients,” &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1" class="link " href="https://centerforweightandwellness.com/about/meet-our-team/scott-kahan/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Scott Kahan;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Scott Kahan&lt;/a&gt;, director of the National Center for Weight and Wellness, tells Yahoo Life. He doesn’t think that a drug like metformin can meet patients’ expectations for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But Hims &amp;amp; Hers may not be expecting metformin to fulfill that promise on its own either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Metformin is just one of the drugs included in Hims &amp;amp; Hers’s “&lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.forhers.com/weight-loss/oral-weight-loss-medication-kits" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Medication Kit 1;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Medication Kit 1&lt;/a&gt;.” In addition to metformin, the kit contains addiction medications (to “reduce cravings and appetite”), a seizure medication that suppresses appetite and vitamin B12 (“for balance”). It’s worth noting that Hers says a licensed medical provider reviews a patient’s health history and treatment plan before sending the medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some of the medications in the kit may cause people to eat less, which may, in turn, lead to minor weight loss, experts say. The drugs also aren’t contraindicated — meaning they aren’t dangerous when taken together — according to Akiyode. But it’s not a medication potpourri that she’s familiar with using for weight loss. And Kahan worries that “this cocktail of stuff” won’t help people lose much weight and may even cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-to-decide-if-metformin-is-right-for-you"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to decide if metformin is right for you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even though doctors don’t consider it a first-line treatment for weight loss, an upside of metformin is that it’s much&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;cheaper than drugs such as Wegovy or Ozempic. A month’s supply of generic oral metformin without insurance costs between $10 and $30, according to &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:17;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.goodrx.com/metformin/how-much-is-metformin-without-insurance" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoodRx;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:17;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;GoodRx&lt;/a&gt;. At nearly $1,000 without insurance, a month’s supply of &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:18;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.goodrx.com/ozempic" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ozempic;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:18;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Ozempic &lt;/a&gt;can cost up to 10 times more than metformin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite research showing only modest benefits from metformin, many Hims &amp;amp; Hers customers say on Reddit forums that they’ve had success with the drug (though, in most cases, it was prescribed along with other medications in their Medication Kit 1). After a month on the cocktail, &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:19;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HersWeightloss/comments/1d2tau9/kit_1_month_1_review/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one user said;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:19;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;one user said&lt;/a&gt; they were down almost 9 pounds. A commenter in the same thread said they were down to 186 pounds from 245 after using kit 1 for a year — a 27% reduction in body weight. Others sang the praises of their slow and steady progress with the program combined, in many cases, with exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Thangudu says that if her patients want to try metformin alone for weight loss and don’t have any health conditions, such as kidney disease, that could make the medication harmful, she will prescribe it. However, Kahan says that his patients who lose significant amounts of weight on metformin alone are “outliers.” And while he’ll allow that there may be instances when the cocktail of medications included in Hims &amp;amp; Hers’s Kit 1 are appropriate, he finds the drug combination in Kit 1 “very concerning” and thinks prescribing it is “bordering on malpractice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nevertheless, if you’re considering taking metformin, experts agree that you should consult with a health care provider to be sure that it’s safe for you to take and that it’s the right medication for your goals. Second, be aware that you may have diarrhea and nausea when you start metformin. Taking it with a meal, especially later in the day, may help stem these effects, which are also milder at lower doses or when using an extended-release form of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kahan says that if his patients are going to lose weight on metformin, they will know fairly quickly. So, if it’s been three months since you started your first dose or one month at a high dose and you’re not losing any weight, it might be time to try something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 12:00:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxPd2ZDRHVMRUJUR1lVeFBFUjFzVUFuSjZUS3BRZlNVbjAtbjdBYWNQc0VkbFFaMUVvRHRtQkRLQ1pjdnlBTmxnOXhpdmNQRUJoamlxVjVlUVdyVnZJRGtEdGdNc2tUR1JXeUVhWGktQ3Q4eUFyZHpyeVhzdURiek51eGpmdXNhcHlKaUgwbDRyX3lhZ1dQSWRwNnNLQi1HdjZDNi1vYVZDTlFyNHRXYzVUMjVnckxMX2h3X0lVU09UMTZRSW8</guid></item><item><title>Mystery illness worries doctors after 50 people die in Congo within hours of symptoms - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxNSlZaUjZQRXRxS3B5VlRkb3BpVVY1WXNRRGlhb2Y3UkpqRFdxQTJTd2p5VnAzUzIzSzFzVWt3LW9BbmtEdUtNRWVHN2k3T2pkMFNkYThUTUU4eTk4NDVSRUlDVlBBZU5wZ01NOUM5MlJJd0dnVzBoeFpwTEEyWlprZ0hxY1NlMXdUSWhTSnBaRXd2SGFOeTFucmMwcWZWZDVYb2RYZlVMRHFEWC1URFE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 lkPksW sc-jbiisr-1 hiukpJ" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 cFynzd" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-0 eFDpwi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 jkkqcL"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 dDFcwe"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 kqOtlp"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 bjQKsM"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 hWxisF sc-hez36s-16 gBaKpR"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 ifXxYf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 jlvSeZ"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 ghJHgZ"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 bhFQeV"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 gMxIQB"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

It’s even &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1911999117" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;true for most other mammals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“It’s a very robust phenomenon all over the world, totally conserved in sickness, during famines, during epidemics, even during times of starvation,” said Dr. Dena Dubal, a professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But the reasons women live longer are complicated and less established — and the fact that they are outliving men doesn’t necessarily mean they are &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/well/live/health-span-aging.html" title=""&gt;living better&lt;/a&gt;.

Is there a way to keep them from coming back?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It usually starts with a tingling at the edge of your lip. Painful, fluid-filled bumps emerge. Then they pop, ooze, scab over and eventually heal. Every few months, this cycle repeats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Cold sores, also known as fever blisters, can develop after infection with the herpes virus. (They’re commonly caused by a version of the virus called herpes simplex virus type 1, or HSV-1, which is different from the version that typically causes genital herpes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;For many, the lesions are “unsightly and painful,” said Dr. Christine Johnston, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Washington School of Medicine. They’re also common, she added: Roughly half of people in the United States have HSV-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here’s how to treat cold sores, and whether you can prevent them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-4bec567b"&gt;What causes cold sores?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The herpes virus is “very contagious,” said Dr. Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Health. You can pick it up through close contact with someone who is infected, such as through kissing or sharing food or drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;And it’s not always easy to tell whether someone is contagious, Dr. Blumberg said. People can transmit oral herpes without a visible cold sore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If you do become infected, you might not develop a cold sore right away or even at all, Dr. Blumberg added.

                Before the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, the disease sickened an estimated three to four million Americans annually and killed hundreds.
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plummeting immunization rates, outbreaks of once-vanquished childhood diseases, and the appointment of a vocal vaccine skeptic as health secretary have US experts sounding the alarm about a looming public health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Since the start of the year, nearly 100 cases of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/measles/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; have been reported in Texas and neighboring New Mexico, raising fears that the highly contagious and potentially serious illness is making a comeback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The measles is the canary in the coal mine," warned leading pediatrician and immunologist Paul Offit, highlighting the decline in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/vaccination+rates/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; since the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid growing distrust of health authorities and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/pharmaceutical+companies/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pharmaceutical companies&lt;/a&gt;, more parents are opting not to vaccinate their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proportion of preschool-aged children vaccinated against measles—which is mandatory—has dropped nationally from 95 percent in 2019 to less than 93 percent in 2023. Some regions show even steeper declines, such as Idaho, where rates have fallen below 80 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts warn that this trend could worsen under the leadership of newly appointed Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., who has repeatedly questioned &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/vaccine+safety/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;vaccine safety&lt;/a&gt; and promoted misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is a disaster waiting to happen, and it will happen," Offit told AFP.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Religious exemptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Louisiana, whooping cough has resulted in the deaths of two children, according to local media. As with measles, experts attribute the resurgence to vaccine exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is already happening. Our &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immunization+rates/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immunization rates&lt;/a&gt; are already low enough that vulnerable children are getting these diseases," said Jennifer Herricks, a scientist and board member of the nonprofit Louisiana Families for Vaccines, in an interview with AFP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across much of the country, parents can opt out of mandatory vaccinations for reasons beyond medical contraindications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many states allow exemptions on religious grounds, while others permit "philosophical" objections—or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In Texas, you can just, pretty much say, I object," explained Terri Burke of the Texas-based Immunization Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent measles cases have been reported in a Texas county with a large Mennonite population—a conservative Christian sect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation is reminiscent of the 2019 measles outbreak, which saw more than 1,200 cases, primarily among unvaccinated Orthodox Jewish communities in New York and New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the reasons behind these exemptions vary—ranging from religious beliefs and fear of side effects to distrust in health authorities or difficulties accessing health care—there is an undeniable trend linked to a "pandemic backlash," said Richard Hughes, a health policy expert at George Washington University.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Legislative offensives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixed messaging on masking, frustration over lockdowns and COVID vaccine mandates—some of which remained in place long after it was clear the shots didn't fully prevent transmission—have eroded public trust, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We might have done better by just continuing to encourage people to be vaccinated than requiring it," Hughes added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But any missteps were amplified by an overwhelming spread of misinformation, which thrived in the era of social media and podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These factors have turned vaccinations into a flashpoint in America's culture wars. Across the country, lawmakers are introducing bills aimed at either enshrining vaccine mandates at the local level, banning certain types of vaccines, or expanding exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of such bills has more than doubled compared to pre-COVID levels, said Herricks, who tracks the issue nationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable shifts include Montana's decision to halt vaccination statistics and Louisiana's cessation of vaccine promotion—both signs of the growing marginalization of a practice that was once a cornerstone of public health policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Offit, Americans may soon face a harsh reality check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, the disease sickened an estimated three to four million Americans annually and killed hundreds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was declared eliminated in the United States by 2000, thanks to widespread immunization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People don't realize how sick and dead that virus can make you," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

The rock pigeon (Columba livia), from which most modern domestic and feral pigeons descend, originally nested in cliffs and rocky crevices in the wild. These environments required minimal nesting materials, as the natural terrain provided protection and support for eggs and chicks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As humans began to domesticate pigeons thousands of years ago, their nesting habits adapted to artificial environments like rooftops, buildings, and ledges that mimicked their natural cliffside habitats. Ancient civilizations, such as those in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Rome, raised pigeons for food, messages, and religious purposes, providing them with simple nesting spaces like dovecotes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over time, pigeons became less dependent on elaborate nest-building because human-provided shelters offered protection and reduced the need for sturdy nests. This historical reliance on natural and artificial shelters influenced their present-day nesting behavior, resulting in the minimalistic and "lazy" nests pigeons are known for today&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DErTD7PzriP" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-8/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249842"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starlings see each other using their exceptional ultraviolet (UV) vision, which allows them to perceive colors beyond what humans can see, meaning they likely see each other with enhanced markings and colors due to the way their feathers reflect UV light, giving them a different visual appearance compared to how we see them; essentially, they can see more detail and distinction between individuals in a flock than we can&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFYXsHZTU-L" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-3/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ELi5 Instagram page is fairly new, created only a year ago in February 2024. Yet it still has quite an impressive following of 518k. We could attribute it to people's love of learning new things; after all, 87% of American internet users &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2014/12/08/more-information-yields-more-learning-and-sharing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;do say&lt;/a&gt; that the World Wide Web has improved their ability to learn new things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of "Explain it to me like I'm 5" isn't new either. The Reddit community of the same name has over 23 million members. The internet is peppered with similar online groups, podcasts, and YouTube shows. We love &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/topics/learning-new-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;learning new things&lt;/a&gt; when they're communicated in a simple, easy-to-understand language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249844"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the 2011 tsunami, scientists helping strawberry farmers in Japan salvage damaged crops accidentally discovered that liquid polyphenol extracted from the berries caused cream to solidify.

This innovative approach, known as “protein degradation,” uses a type of molecule called a PROTAC (proteolysis-targeting chimeras) to bind a disease-causing protein to another protein that tags it for destruction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Essentially, it reprograms the cell’s machinery to remove harmful proteins selectively, triggering cancer cells to destroy themselves while sparing healthy cells. This technique is still being refined, but it represents a promising strategy for targeted cancer therapy, especially for cancers resistant to conventional treatments. 📸- Ella Maru Studio/ Stanford Medicene&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCn-wANPj4M" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-13/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249867"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is 12-hour time even taught? Wouldn’t it just be easier to remember 13:00 instead of 1:00pm? 12 hour time is a very ancient system that traces back to the Mesopotamian empires. They had a cultural fixation on the number 12, used a base-12 numerical system, and divided up most things into 12ths whenever possible - including day and night. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 12 hours of day and 12 hours of night system spread throughout Europe and the Middle East and has defied multiple attempts to change it over the centuries. Also for anyone curious why there was such a love of the number 12, it was because that was how they counted on their hand. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Look at your hand. Notice how each of your fingers minus your thumb has three easily identifiable parts to it. They used to count by using their thumb to count each part of the finger, much in the same way we count to 10 using our fingers today. So, 12 was the max you could count on one hand&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_FV1atp_xs" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-28/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first encounter with complex &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/scary-science-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;science facts&lt;/a&gt; explained understandably for many Americans was probably the &lt;em&gt;Bill Nye the Science Guy &lt;/em&gt;series in their childhood. For many millennials and Gen Z, &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/topics/bill-nye/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;Bill Nye&lt;/a&gt; is still the go-to person when they think about learning about science in a fun and interesting way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The positive impact of Nye's show was also proved by researchers. They &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/12190/learning-science-in-informal-environments-people-places-and-pursuits" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that those who watched &lt;em&gt;Bill Nye the Science Guy &lt;/em&gt;regularly were better at explaining scientific ideas than non-viewers. There's also a trend that we tend to learn better overall in informal environments, be it a TV show or a simple Instagram page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249848"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil’s mysterious tunnels, known as paleoburrows, are massive underground structures found predominantly in the southern and southeastern regions of the country. These fascinating formations are believed to have been dug thousands of years ago by extinct giant ground sloths, some of which were the size of modern-day elephants. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professor Heinrich Frank, a geologist from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, first encountered these tunnels during an expedition and was immediately struck by their sheer scale and the distinct claw marks etched into their walls, undeniable evidence of ancient megafauna activity. Frank’s research revealed that some of these tunnels stretch over 600 meters, with diameters wide enough to walk through. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He suggests that these burrows were likely created as shelters or protective spaces, though their exact purpose remains a mystery. Frank’s expeditions have also shed light on how these extinct creatures shaped their environment, showcasing their engineering capabilities. These paleoburrows provide a unique window into prehistoric ecosystems and underscore the significant role these massive creatures played in altering their habitats&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEjs1s_zGIV" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-9/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249861"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1960, David Latimer planted a spiderwort sprout inside of a large glass jar, added a quarter pint of water, and then sealed it shut. He opened the bottle for the first time only 12 years later, in 1972, to add some water and then sealed it for good. The self-contained ecosystem flourished for more than 60 years as a perfectly balanced garden and self-sufficient ecosystem. The bacteria in the compost ate the dead plants and broke down the oxygen released, turning it into carbon dioxide, essentially forming a microcosm of Earth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAn84boTVTs" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-22/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249865"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third Man Syndrome is a curious psychological phenomenon where people in extreme, life-threatening situations, such as explorers, mountaineers, or disaster survivors, feel the presence of an invisible companion. This "third man" is often perceived as a calm, comforting figure who provides guidance, encouragement, and a sense of safety, even though no one is actually there. It’s not just a vague feeling; many describe this presence as real, almost like a guardian angel helping them through a critical moment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imagine you're lost in the middle of a desert, exhausted and close to giving up. Suddenly, it feels like someone is walking alongside you, quietly encouraging you to keep moving, guiding your steps, even though you know you're physically alone. It’s as if your mind, under extreme stress, creates this "companion" to help you survive, similar to how we sometimes talk to ourselves for reassurance during tough times. In moments of intense fear or danger, the brain can conjure this supportive figure to help push through and keep going when survival feels impossible. It's the mind's way of creating a psychological lifeline when you need it most&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAVFowCTsve" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-26/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we call it "Explain it like I'm 5", we don't necessarily want things explained to us like we're literally five years old. It's about breaking concepts down to the very essentials;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/fact-tired-explaining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt; explaining things&lt;/a&gt; in such a manner so that a person with absolutely no background on the topic would be able to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249854"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study led by UCL and the Anna Freud Centre used fMRI scans to investigate the impact of family violence on children's brain activity. The research revealed that children exposed to domestic violence show heightened activation in the anterior insula and amygdala - regions associated with threat detection and anxiety - when viewing angry faces. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This neural response mirrors the brain activity found in soldiers exposed to combat, suggesting that both groups may become "hyper-aware" of danger due to their environments. These changes in brain functioning, although potentially adaptive in the short term, may increase the risk of developing anxiety disorders later in life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Eamon McCrory, lead author, notes that while none of the children studied had mental health issues at the time, their altered brain function could indicate an underlying risk factor. Professor Peter Fonagy, Chief Executive of the Anna Freud Centre, highlighted the importance of this research in raising awareness of the lasting impact of violence on children's brain development and in guiding clinical and social work practices. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings underscore the need for continued efforts to protect children from violence and to develop effective treatment strategies. The next research steps include investigating how stable these brain changes are and understanding the resilience mechanisms that help some children overcome early adversity&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCPVQKPz_2B" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-15/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249845"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In certain forests, when you look up you will see a network of cracks formed by gaps between the outermost edges of the tree branches. It looks like a precisely engineered jigsaw puzzle, each branch growing just perfectly so it almost - but not quite - touches the neighboring tree. This beautiful phenomenon is called crown shyness. Crown shyness doesn’t happen all the time, and scientists aren’t completely certain why it happens at all. There is some evidence that it most commonly occurs with similarly aged trees, especially stands of the same species. But it can occur in any forest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFKDR7pTeJx" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-6/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249862"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, when you are standing, blood flow slows and "pools" in your legs due to gravity. But when you walk, your muscles contract and push the blood in your veins and vessels back up into your upper body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the side note, seasoned military personnels are able to stand at ease for long periods of time because they are actually swaying back and forth very slowly in micro-movements to contract their muscles and relieve the tingling and numb sensation you get when you keep standing for long periods of time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAlFkFiTIjC" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-23/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who use the ELI5 principle most often are science communicators. As Kelly Tabbutt, the visiting assistant professor of sociology at the Oberlin College and Conservatory &lt;a href="https://fancycomma.substack.com/p/eli5-explain-it-to-me-like-im-five" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt;, there are a lot of similarities between elementary education and communicating science to the general public. In both contexts, people avoid jargon, use uncomplicated real-world examples, and present the information in an entertaining manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249863"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 9,000-year-old skeleton, nicknamed Cheddar Man, was discovered in Gough's Cave in Cheddar, England. This ancient skeleton, one of the oldest ever found in Britain, has provided a fascinating glimpse into early human history. DNA analysis revealed that Cheddar Man had dark skin, blue eyes, and dark, curly hair, challenging previous assumptions about the appearance of early Europeans. Even more astonishing, scientists found a living relative of Cheddar Man residing just half a mile away, tracing the lineage back nearly 300 generations. This discovery underscores the deep ancestral connections between ancient populations and modern-day descendants, highlighting the continuity of human history in specific geographic regions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAecPVWORu9" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-24/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249843"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood Falls is a strange and fascinating natural phenomenon in Antarctica where bright red water seeps out from a glacier, making it look like the ice is bleeding. It flows from the Taylor Glacier in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, one of the coldest and driest places on Earth. At first glance, it seems like the red color might be due to algae or some other living organisms, but the real reason is actually hidden deep below the glacier. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The science behind Blood Falls lies in its salty, iron-rich water. About 2 million years ago, a small body of water got trapped under the glacier, cut off from sunlight and oxygen. Over time, the water absorbed a lot of iron from the surrounding rocks. Because there's no oxygen, the iron stays dissolved in the water, just like iron in an old rusty pipe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the water finally escapes and reaches the surface, it comes into contact with oxygen in the air, causing the iron to oxidize and turn red, just like rust. This reaction is what gives Blood Falls its eerie, blood-like color. Despite the extreme conditions, scientists have also discovered tiny microbes living in the water, proving that life can exist even in some of the harshest places on Earth&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFdZPDrznHT" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-4/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249853"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokyo has seen an 84% decrease in suicides at train stations where blue LED lights were installed. First introduced in 2009 on the Yamanote line, these lights were part of a broader initiative to address the city’s high s*****e rates. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The calming effect of blue light on mood is thought to play a role, as well as the lights’ strategic positioning on platforms. Alongside the lights, Tokyo also implemented automatic gates and barriers on train platforms to deter attempts, as well as improved counseling services like the “Inochi no Denwa” hotline. Additional steps include government-funded programs aimed at reducing suicides by 20% from 2005 levels. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This includes investigating the root causes of s*****e and working to shift cultural attitudes. These interventions are costly, but they have contributed to a recent drop in s*****e rates, showing some progress in Tokyo’s ongoing efforts to address this complex issue.

Breaking down things to their essence is a skill perhaps only a few of us have. Teaching is hard, as even Bill Gates &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2015/12/11/bill-and-melinda-gates-brilliantly-explain-complex-stuff-in-simple-words/#4706dea830b8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;once said&lt;/a&gt;. "You need different skills to keep students from getting bored."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249857"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lagoons of water found in Sahara Desert after 50 years of being dry&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently, parts of the Sahara Desert, especially in Morocco, experienced unusual rainfall after 50 years of dryness. This rare event caused lagoons of water to appear in regions that had been dry for decades. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rainfall was triggered by a combination of factors, including the northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which typically stays closer to the equator. Warm ocean waters, converging winds, and strong sunlight created the perfect conditions for this significant rainfall. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In places like Tagounite, more than a third of the annual average rainfall fell in just 24 hours. The heavy rain filled dried lake beds and desert areas, creating temporary pools and rivers that haven't been seen for years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scientists suggest that climate change and shifts in atmospheric patterns may have contributed to this anomaly. The rains are helping replenish groundwater sources, but also caused floods and damage in rural areas&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DA_cAyvzCQg" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s89nBXauLSY" target="_blank"&gt; WION / Youtube &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-18/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249850"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When helicopters operate in sandy environments, the downward thrust of their rotors kicks up clouds of sand. As the blades cut through, the hard sand erodes the abrasion-resistant titanium or nickel coatings, releasing fine metal particles. These fragments ignite due to heat and their pyrophoric nature, producing the fiery Kopp-Etchells Effect. The Kopp-Etchells Effect was named in honor of two soldiers, Benjamin S. Kopp (U.S. Army) and Joseph Etchells (U.K. Army), who died in Afghanistan in July 2009. The term was coined by Michael Yon, a former Green Beret and independent combat journalist 📸- Michael Yon/X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDMmxOPTQhy" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-11/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249871"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was some concern that cell phones might interfere with communication by the pilots but that is proven to not be an issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However cell towers mainly point their antenna at the ground because that is where the people tend to be. When you are flying you will be changing cell tower zones very quickly and it will be very difficult for your cell phone to talk to them, if it can reach them at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a result your phone will tend to crank up its transmitter to maximum power and basically scream into the void searching for a signal, burning battery power and producing as much radio noise as allowable. Since you know it won't work right it is best practice to turn on airplane mode so it won't do that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plus there is a marginal increase in the risk that if a battery problem in a phone was going to happen, thrashing it in such a manner might tend to kick it off right then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8PcbpKoiS1" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-32/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-18"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why, in the past, Gates tried to make his presentations about public health, renewable energy, and environmental issues as memorable and entertaining as possible. When speaking about the effects of malaria, he famously &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/bill-gates-releases-mosquitoes-audience-flna1c9455619" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;released mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt; into the crowd. When he talked about clean energy, he &lt;a href="https://techland.time.com/2010/02/18/what-do-fireflies-and-bill-gates-have-in-common/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;brought&lt;/a&gt; fireflies. And when he presented the Janicki Omniprocessor that can purify wastewater, he shocked people by &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/01/10/376182321/bill-gates-raises-a-glass-to-and-of-water-made-from-poop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;drinking&lt;/a&gt; a glass of 'poop water.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249877"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;KAIST researchers, led by Professor Kwang-Hyun Cho, have introduced a revolutionary approach to treating colon cancer by reprogramming cancer cells into a normal-like state instead of destroying them. Traditional cancer treatments aim to eliminate cancer cells, but they often lead to resistance, recurrence, and severe side effects due to damage to healthy cells. This new method offers a promising alternative by addressing cancer without causing harm to surrounding tissues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research team focused on the concept that during cancer development, normal cells regress along their differentiation pathway. To better understand this process, they developed a digital twin model of the gene network that controls normal cell differentiation. Through simulation analysis, they identified key molecular switches capable of pushing cancer cells back into a normal-like state. When applied to colon cancer cells, these switches successfully reversed their malignant characteristics, a breakthrough confirmed through molecular experiments and animal studies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This study highlights the potential for "reversible cancer therapy," a novel concept where cancer cells can be reprogrammed rather than eradicated. Unlike conventional treatments that rely on trial-and-error drug discoveries, this approach systematically identifies key targets using computational models. The findings suggest that similar techniques could be applied to other types of cancer, opening new avenues for safer and more effective treatments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study, co-authored by Jeong-Ryeol Gong, Chun-Kyung Lee, Hoon-Min Kim, Juhee Kim, and Jaeog Jeon, was published in Advanced Science on December 11.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source - KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/explainlikeimfivee/p/DGJC-tNTe61/?img_index=1" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-38/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249866"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are lucky enough to survive a lightning strike, in addition to the physical and psychological consequences, you will see a kind of tree or root-shaped tattoo on your body: lightning flowers. These are generated when a body that does not conduct electricity receives a high electric charge. Lightning flowers, also known as Lichtenberg figures, are produced when the capillary vessels under the skin break due to the lightning discharge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The appearance or shape we see would mark the path and degree of absorption of the lightning. These natural “tattoos” do not last a lifetime, they only appear for a few hours or days until they disappear completely. It should be noted that these figures can also appear in places where lightning strikes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although it is not very common, there are occasions in which they have been observed in grassy areas where lightning has struck, such as golf courses or soccer stadiums. These figures were discovered by the German scientist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg in 1977, after whom they are named. The so-called lightning flowers had such peculiar ramifications that they generated great interest and began to be studied. Nature is as beautiful as it is dangerous. That is why every precaution is too little when faced with natural phenomena such as a thunderstorm&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAOGgOOuBQ7" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-27/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249858"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hurricanes form when warm ocean water heats the air above it, causing that air to rise quickly. As the warm air rises, it creates an area of low pressure below, pulling in cooler air to replace it. This cycle of warm air rising and cooler air filling in beneath starts to create strong winds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the winds pick up, the storm begins to rotate due to the Earth's rotation (Coriolis effect). The storm grows in power, drawing in more moisture and heat from the ocean, and eventually becomes a hurricane when wind speeds exceed 74 mph. The key ingredients for hurricane formation are warm ocean waters (at least 26.5°C or 80°F), moist air, and favorable wind conditions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the storm intensifies, it forms a characteristic "eye" in the center, which is surrounded by a dangerous eyewall where the strongest winds and rain occur. Hurricanes can bring heavy rains, storm surges (where ocean water is pushed onto land), and damaging winds that cause widespread destruction. Hurricane Milton, currently one of the strongest storms in 2024, follows this same process. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has grown to a Category 5 hurricane, with wind speeds reaching up to 180 mph. The storm formed over the warm waters of the Atlantic and rapidly intensified. It is now threatening Florida with life-threatening winds, storm surges, and flooding. Authorities have issued evacuation orders as Milton approaches the coast, expecting it to bring significant destruction across a wide area&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DA5hHDwz6Ms" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-19/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-21"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no shame in admitting you don't understand complex scientific concepts and need them explained simply. Astrophysicist and science communicator extraordinaire Carl Sagan &lt;a href="https://www.humanelementcommunications.com/insights/keep-it-simple-carl-sagans-science-communication-advice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in his 1994 book &lt;em&gt;The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Handle in the Dark&lt;/em&gt; about the importance of clearly communicating difficult subjects to the general public. "Don’t talk to the general audience as you would your scientific colleagues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249860"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it's a shortcut, a simplified system created by scribes who had to write a lot by hand. So these scribes (some of them were monks) discovered that instead of raising the pen from the paper over and over again to write a new, separated letter, it was easier and faster to keep a continuous line that flows tying one letter to the next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This system, called cursive, works great for some of the Latin letters, but not for most of them which had to be adapted. This is why A, B, E F, G, H, I, L, M, N, Q, R and sometimes S look very different in cursive from their uppercase versions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This cursive system was later adapted by printers as the lowercase fonts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAwGa35T8Qe" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/cropped-side-view-schoolgirl-sitting-outdoors_7337899.htm#fromView=search&amp;amp;page=2&amp;amp;position=26&amp;amp;uuid=ad6475f4-7ede-4fd4-ac54-7a45b38fd097&amp;amp;query=handwriting+alphabet+poster" target="_blank"&gt; drobotdean / freepik &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-21/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249864"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dina Sanichar, often called the "real-life Mowgli," was a boy discovered in 1867 by hunters in the jungles of Uttar Pradesh, India. When found, he was living with a pack of wolves and behaving like one of them - walking on all fours, growling, and eating raw meat. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hunters brought him to the Sikandra Mission Orphanage, where caretakers tried to help him adapt to human life. However, Dina never fully adjusted; he struggled with basic human skills like speaking, using utensils, or wearing clothes. Though he learned to walk upright and eat cooked food, he remained largely silent and withdrawn. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His story, along with accounts of other "feral children" found in the wild, is believed to have inspired Rudyard Kipling's famous character Mowgli in *The Jungle Book*, who was also raised by wolves. Dina’s life showcases the profound impact of early life experiences on human development and the challenges of reintegrating into society after living in the wild. His existence reflects the thin line between human and animal behavior and how environment shapes who we are&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAaZdIHTNgv" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-25/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249869"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armpit sweat glands are known as apocrine sweat glands, and instead of just sweat, they also produce a mix of proteins and lipids.&lt;br&gt;The bacteria on your skin love that stuff and eat it up, producing waste products in the process.

"&lt;em&gt;Use the simplest possible language&lt;/em&gt;," he wrote. "Above all, remember how it was before you, yourself, grasped whatever it is you're explaining."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249870"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;4WD and AWD roughly do the same thing but in different ways, the car is proving power to all four of its wheels. The difference is how that power is &amp;gt; divided between them. An AWD car can allow each wheel to turn at a different rate, while a 4WD car generally has its wheel all turning at the same rate.&lt;br&gt;This 4WD set up is better for offroad driving, but can cause problems in city driving, where the inside wheels need to turn slower around a corner than the outside wheels do. Because of this, a lot of 4WD cars are designed to be able to switch to rear-wheel drive when the 4WD is not needed&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8eoz2FI6lR" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-31/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249878"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that carrots dramatically improve eyesight, especially night vision, is actually a myth that started during World War II. The British Royal Air Force spread this rumor to hide the real reason their pilots had improved night-fighting abilities—radar technology. They claimed that pilots ate a lot of carrots, which helped them see enemy planes better at night. This clever propaganda misled enemies and also popularized the idea that eating carrots could significantly boost vision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, while carrots don’t give you super eyesight, they do contain beta-carotene, a type of pigment that the body converts into vitamin A. Vitamin A is essential for eye health because it helps maintain the retina, particularly the part responsible for seeing in low light (the rod cells). A deficiency in vitamin A can lead to night blindness, but consuming more than the necessary amount doesn’t give you enhanced vision beyond normal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, while eating carrots can help prevent vision problems related to vitamin A deficiency, they won’t give you night-vision superpowers. The best way to keep your eyes healthy is a balanced diet with a variety of nutrients, not just relying on carrots!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/explainlikeimfivee/p/DGGZklBTyGP/" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-39/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249849"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Happens When You Hold in a Fart? Clare Collins, a professor of nutrition and dietetics at the University of Newcastle, explains that holding in a fart can cause intestinal gas to build up, leading to abdominal distension. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of this gas may be reabsorbed into the bloodstream and exhaled through your breath. If held in too long, the gas will eventually escape as an uncontrollable fart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Research is unclear on whether this increases the risk of conditions like diverticulitis or has no significant impact. Studies also show that a high-fiber diet, like one including baked beans and psyllium, leads to fewer but larger farts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For digestive health, the best approach is simple: when you feel the need to pass gas, find a private spot and let it go. Holding it in does more harm than good&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEhPQkDv3JE" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-10/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-27"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brain-Rules-Updated-Expanded-Principles/dp/098326337X?tag=vilofjoy-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;Brain Rules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, molecular biologist John Medina claims that we learn better when there are visual stimuli accompanying an explanation.

Unlike short-term stimulants like caffeine, walnuts support brain health in a more natural and lasting way. Adding them to your diet could enhance focus, learning, and mental performance over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/explainlikeimfivee/p/DGZ5tWYzUwr/" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-33/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249879"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ulnar dimelia, also known as "Mirror Hand Syndrome," is an extremely rare congenital anomaly where the forearm and hand structures are duplicated symmetrically.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This condition is characterized by the absence of the radius bone, which is one of the two main bones in the forearm, and instead, there is a duplication of the ulna, the other forearm bone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a result, individuals with this condition typically have an abnormal number of fingers—usually seven or eight—without a functional thumb. This mirror-like duplication leads to a unique but non-functional hand structure, often requiring surgical intervention to improve functionality. While the exact cause of ulnar dimelia is not fully understood, it is believed to be linked to disruptions in early limb development during fetal growth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Due to its rarity, cases of mirror hand syndrome provide valuable insights into limb formation and genetic regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/explainlikeimfivee/p/DF-4Ix4z6ES/?img_index=1" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-40/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-30"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough," theoretical physicist Albert Einstein said.

Goliath was much larger than the average American bullfrog tadpole, making it a unique case for researchers to study. Normally, tadpoles undergo metamorphosis to become froglets, a process controlled by thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). However, when there is a hormonal imbalance, this transformation can be disrupted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a tadpole lacks the gene that produces thyroxine, it cannot metamorphose into a frog. In some cases, developmental hormones may be turned off or reduced, while growth hormones may be excessively active, leading to abnormal size without proper development. Unfortunately, Goliath died in 2019, and researchers suspect that his extreme size was a result of this hormonal imbalance. They were investigating the underlying causes of his unusual condition to better understand similar cases in amphibians.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;📸 - Earyn McGee/SWRS/The Frog Conservation Project&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/explainlikeimfivee/p/DFvaSGYzkb0/?img_index=1" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-42/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249882"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An armadillo's armor is much more than just tough skin; it is actually a separate bone structure that sits on top of their skeleton. This bony shell acts like a natural armor, protecting the armadillo from predators. The structure is made of bony plates, known as "scutes," that are attached to the armadillo’s body, providing both strength and flexibility to move. This unique feature helps armadillos survive in the wild, allowing them to roll up into a ball for extra protection against threats.

Likely belonging to a juvenile coelurosaur, this specimen offers an exceptional glimpse into the Cretaceous period, showcasing not only bones but also feathers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The preservation of feathers in such detail allows scientists to study their structure and color like never before. Amber preserved delicate features that would have otherwise decayed in traditional fossils, including the fine arrangement of feathers resembling those of modern birds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This discovery provides valuable insights into the evolution of feathers, shedding light on their roles in thermoregulation, display, or flight. Along with the tail, plant debris and a Cretaceous-era ant were also preserved, offering a rare snapshot of the ecosystem from that time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This find is crucial for understanding the morphology and habitat of feathered dinosaurs, bridging the evolutionary gap between dinosaurs and birds. 📸- R.C.

The patient had no comorbidities, and his colonoscopy prep involved drinking a gallon of polyethylene glycol, a powerful laxative used to clean the colon. This prep may have helped the ladybug avoid being broken down by stomach acids and digestive enzymes, allowing it to make the full journey through the digestive system. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doctors think the bug, identified as "Harmonia axyridis", a multicolored Asian ladybug introduced to North America for pest control, entered the man’s body while he was asleep. Though it’s rare for insects to be ingested, it does happen occasionally. How this ladybug survived the entire trip is a mystery, and the case study published in the "AGC Case Reports Journal" doesn’t confirm whether the bug made it out alive.

Studies have found that surgeons who play video games for at least three hours a week work 27% faster and make 37% fewer mistakes compared to those who don’t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is because video games, especially those that require precision and quick reflexes, improve hand-eye coordination, reaction time, and fine motor skills—all of which are essential for surgery. Many modern surgeries, like laparoscopic procedures, require surgeons to control tiny instruments while looking at a screen, similar to playing a game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, gaming improves problem-solving skills, focus, and the ability to make quick decisions, which are crucial during high-pressure operations. While playing video games alone won’t make someone a great surgeon, it can certainly sharpen the skills needed for delicate medical procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/explainlikeimfivee/p/DGONVnuzfzq/" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-36/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249880"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Earth might feel massive to us, but compared to the Sun’s powerful solar flares, it’s tiny. A typical solar flare can extend thousands of kilometers into space, and the largest ones can be more than 10 times the diameter of Earth! To put it in perspective, if Earth were the size of a grape, a massive solar flare would be like a fiery explosion bigger than a basketball. These flares release immense energy—sometimes equivalent to millions of nuclear bombs exploding at once—showing just how small and fragile our planet is in the face of the Sun’s power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/explainlikeimfivee/p/DF0wNvzz_cP/" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-41/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249846"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have discovered a 300-million-year-old fossilized rainforest hidden deep beneath the surface in a coal mine in Illinois, USA. It is the largest forest of its kind ever unearthed and offers an unparalleled glimpse into the ecology of one of the planet’s earliest tropical forests. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paleobiologists from the US National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) in Washington, DC, and the University of Bristol in the UK identified an extraordinary collection of extinct plants, including club mosses that were over a meter thick and reached heights of more than 40 meters. The fossils were located nearly 100 meters below the surface at the Riola and Vermilion Grove mines in Vermilion County, Illinois. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The forest was encased in mud 300 million years ago when a major earthquake or similar catastrophic event caused the entire area to abruptly sink below sea level.

This specimen, preserved in the permafrost near the Badyarikha River, is over 35,000 years old and provides an extraordinary glimpse into this ice-age predator, with intact fur, skin, and paw pads. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The cub, estimated to be just three weeks old at death, offers valuable insights into its anatomy and hunting adaptations. Unlike modern lions, its robust forelimbs and larger jaws suggest reliance on strength and agility to subdue prey. The well-preserved body allows scientists to examine features such as shorter ears and a sturdier neck, pointing to unique evolutionary traits. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DNA analysis of this fossil could unravel critical details about saber-toothed cats’ lineage, which diverged from other felines around 18 million years ago. This discovery highlights the permafrost’s role in preserving ancient life and deepens our understanding of extinct species.

This means that Nepal's time is 5 hours and 45 minutes ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Most countries set their time zones in whole-hour increments, like UTC+5:00 or UTC+6:00, but Nepal is different because it uses a 45-minute offset instead of the usual 30-minute or 60-minute adjustments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This unusual time setting dates back to 1956, when Nepal decided to base its official time on the longitude of Mount Gaurishankar (east of Kathmandu) instead of its capital. This led to the extra 15-minute shift from the more common UTC+5:30, which countries like India and Sri Lanka follow. The decision reflects Nepal’s independence in setting its own time rather than following its neighbors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because of this, Nepal stands out as one of the few places in the world with a 45-minute time zone offset, making it a unique feature in global timekeeping. This difference can sometimes cause confusion when setting clocks, scheduling flights, or adjusting digital devices. However, for Nepal, this small but significant difference symbolizes its sovereignty and national identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/explainlikeimfivee/p/DGLn6xgzW9h/" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-37/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249883"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have discovered a 300-million-year-old fossilized rainforest hidden deep beneath the surface in a coal mine in Illinois, USA.

Studies have shown that when dogs poop, they often align their bodies along a north-south axis, meaning they prefer facing either toward the North or South while avoiding the East-West direction. Scientists believe dogs use this ability to stay oriented in their environment, just like birds and other animals that rely on the Earth's magnetosphere for navigation. This behavior is most noticeable when the Earth's magnetic field is calm and undisturbed. Though we don’t fully understand why dogs do this, it’s likely linked to their evolutionary instincts for survival and spatial awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/explainlikeimfivee/p/DGUzjPkT6kZ/" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-34/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249874"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blushing is something only humans do, and it’s one of the most fascinating and unique reactions of our body. It happens when we feel embarrassed, shy, or even guilty. The reason behind this is tied to our emotions and how our body responds to them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we feel a strong emotion like embarrassment, our brain sends a signal to our body to release adrenaline. Adrenaline makes our blood vessels widen, especially in our face, which causes more blood to rush to the skin. This is why our cheeks turn red when we blush. It’s an automatic response, meaning we can’t control it, no matter how much we might want to!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scientists believe blushing is linked to human social behavior. It’s a way of showing others that we recognize a mistake or feel shy about something. In a way, it helps people trust us more because it signals honesty. Other animals may show emotions in different ways, but blushing is something only humans experience. It’s a reminder of how deeply connected our emotions and physical reactions are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/explainlikeimfivee/p/DGQx5k3TcSA/" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-35/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bored Panda</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 07:33:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBPc2VhbVE0ZlYwQjlaVUlBQzMxUGh6djNndlFDUzZPWXpsWDAwTGd0amlUczFnY3hWcUxmNEtMa0lPX0tZUk94Q2xJYy1nYkg3S1d5cmhZVFdrOXhRc2dUdWwyZjkyc3lSU1BZQ0Q2WWg</guid></item><item><title>US Measles Outbreak Surges Towards 100 Cases - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE9ORTNTN2kyMG11Q3BDQ21JMTViUjA0ZzYyVFl1Nll2cVRONXdpUlZuVFRJSkpPU2p1eDVqR2ZiTklIT0dxaTF2OGxjbUNpd1FhcEUwVXJfRHk1ZFlyWXlUZXFlYlE1cGY4Y01qLS1tbmNmYnU4Y3VNd3Q2ZWdQQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An outbreak of measles in the US is approaching 100 cases as it spreads into more heavily populated areas, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;predominantly affecting&lt;/a&gt; children and adolescents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;First detected in late January as two schoolchildren were hospitalized for the disease in Gaines County, Texas, the highly infectious virus has since crossed state borders into New Mexico and Georgia, leading to fears of missing cases. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A list of current exposure sites in West Texas can be found &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-exposures-central-south-central-texas"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;23 of the 93 known cases&lt;/a&gt; have bee&lt;span&gt;n hospitalized so far. More than 80 percent of cases are individuals under the age of 19, leading to the shutdown of several private schools.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This is the tip of the iceberg," Rekha Lakshmanan &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-escalates-undetected-cases-vaccinations/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;suspects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, telling Amy Maxmen at KFF Health News: "We are going to see more kids infected. We will see more families taking time off from work. More kids in the hospital."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Measles can spread before the emergence of symptoms, which can include fever, cough, runny nose and irritated eyes, white spots in the mouth, and a red flat skin rash about three days after initial symptoms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the worst cases, the highly infectious virus can cause serious health complications including pneumonia, blindness, brain damage, and death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Measles is a highly contagious airborne disease spread by contact with an infected person through coughing and sneezing," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hayscountytx.gov/possible-measles-exposure-in-san-marcos"&gt;&lt;span&gt;warns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Hays County Local Health Authority physician John Turner in a public health alert. "Texas is currently experiencing the largest outbreak of measles in decades."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153204" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153204" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PercentVaccinatedPerStateUSmeaslesMap.jpg" alt="Map showing the percent of the population of each state vaccinated for measles" class="wp-image-153204 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PercentVaccinatedPerStateUSmeaslesMap.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PercentVaccinatedPerStateUSmeaslesMap-560x415.jpg 560w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PercentVaccinatedPerStateUSmeaslesMap-600x445.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153204" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;It takes 95 percent vaccine coverage for community protection. (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The measles virus, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles_virus"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Morbillivirus hominis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, can survive in the air for hours, allowing each infected person to spread it to an average of 18 other individuals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once in a person's airways, the RNA molecule targets their immune cells, duplicating within them and spreading itself through the lymphatic system. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here, it not only suppresses immunity but destroys the body's defenses against infections by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://asm.org/articles/2019/may/measles-and-immune-amnesia"&gt;&lt;span&gt;wiping out the immune system's memory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This 'memory loss' can continue for up to three years, leaving people vulnerable to secondary infections like pneumonia – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;the main cause of death&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in children with measles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Years after recovery, the infection can still trigger a rare but fatal condition in the central nervous system called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subacute_sclerosing_panencephalitis"&gt;&lt;span&gt;subacute sclerosing panencephalitis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is no specific treatment for the disease, but vaccination programs have successfully suppressed the spread of measles for decades, leading to an &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;official elimination of the disease&lt;/a&gt; in the US at the turn of the century. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prior to the vaccine's development,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; some 48,000 hospitalizations and around 500 deaths occurred each year as a direct result of infections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153205" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153205" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MeaslesVaccineSymptomsVsInfection.jpg" alt="Measles Cases Continue to Increase Alarmingly in The US" class="wp-image-153205 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MeaslesVaccineSymptomsVsInfection.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MeaslesVaccineSymptomsVsInfection-642x803.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MeaslesVaccineSymptomsVsInfection-332x415.jpg 332w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MeaslesVaccineSymptomsVsInfection-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MeaslesVaccineSymptomsVsInfection-600x750.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153205" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(NYC health)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health authorities have been warning for years that a decrease in vaccine uptake would lead to greater outbreaks of measles, a reality that is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/measles-cases-soaring-worldwide-as-who-reports-alarming-45-fold-rise-in-europe"&gt;&lt;span&gt;currently unfolding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/global-measles-cases-rise-by-20-as-who-blames-one-key-factor"&gt;&lt;span&gt;around the world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Measles &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/measles-cases-soaring-worldwide-as-who-reports-alarming-45-fold-rise-in-europe"&gt;&lt;span&gt;outbreaks increased&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; by 45 times in Europe between 2022 and 2023.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most of those who have been infected in the current US outbreak are unvaccinated. Gaines County is an area with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/conscientious-exemptions"&gt;&lt;span&gt;one of the lowest vaccine rates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in Texas. Almost &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/texas-measles-outbreak-grows-90-cases-unvaccinated-people/story?id=119041244"&gt;&lt;span&gt;20 percent of parents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of young children have filed for vaccine exemptions in the region.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health officials in Texas are running mobile testing units in schools and pop-up vaccine clinics to attempt to get ahead of the disease, while also facing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://immunizeusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-TX-Vaccine-Bills_2025-02-05.pdf"&gt;&lt;span&gt;increasing health policy obstacles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to widescale vaccination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I told my husband we have to put off trying for a baby again until we can move, and he said I was overreacting.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="V3O4FG6NARBLJK6MMPKWWXNPWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;He was out of town when this happened, and I had only my younger sister with me. First, the ER of the small hospital nearest to us seemed to be in an absolute panic when I was first diagnosed. I thought it was because they were worried about my condition, but now I think they were scared to treat me. They transferred me to a much larger hospital via ambulance. Once I got to the second ER, they gave me some pain meds and then sent me to labor and delivery, where the obstetrician stopped the pain meds “in case the pregnancy was actually viable.” They let me sit for hours while I complained and worried about the pain getting worse and worse.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RWNEJPC5BBD25CECXBGNDYHTVA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;After I’d been there six hours, I convinced a nurse that the pain was so bad I couldn’t take it anymore; she arranged for an ultrasound that showed how bad things were, and I was rushed into surgery. When I was in recovery, I asked what took so long and the OB told me they were deciding what to do. What was there to decide?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2RUNDNUVO5CVZOVY6PAMDVG6IY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;We would still like to try for a baby, but I refuse to do it when I live in a state that treats women this way.

For instance, a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24561114/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24561114/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;2014 study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; indicates that the more muscle we have, the higher our chances are of living longer. A more &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38595265/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38595265/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research&lt;/em&gt; identified a correlation between muscle weakness (by testing grip strength) and earlier all-cause mortality. So, should we all be hitting the gym to live longer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, says personal trainer &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://emmasimarro.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://emmasimarro.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Emma Simarro&lt;/a&gt;. Simarro believes that we all should focus on building muscle and getting strong to increase the likelihood of living independently for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more muscle we have, the longer we live,” says Simarro. “Our muscles are an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.90100.2007#:~:text=Skeletal%20muscle%20has%20recently%20been%20identified%20as%20an%20organ%20that,muscle%20is%20an%20endocrine%20organ" target="_blank" data-url="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.90100.2007#:~:text=Skeletal%20muscle%20has%20recently%20been%20identified%20as%20an%20organ%20that,muscle%20is%20an%20endocrine%20organ" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;endocrine system&lt;/a&gt; in their own right: they affect our immunity, energy levels and sleep because they produce hormones. The more muscle mass you have, the more your survivability increases. Even if you were diagnosed with cancer, if you have more muscle your &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5947445/#:~:text=This%20study%20in%20older%20patients,will%20benefit%20from%20anticancer%20treatment." target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5947445/#:~:text=This%20study%20in%20older%20patients,will%20benefit%20from%20anticancer%20treatment." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;survivability rate goes up&lt;/a&gt; because of how they function—it's amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building muscle takes on even greater importance for women. “It's mandatory I would say; even if you don't like it, women still need to do it,” says Simarro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason is that muscle is important for protecting bones, and women see a decrease in their bone mass from the age of 30, with a huge drop-off after menopause as the hormone estrogen decreases, making women more prone to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/osteoporosis" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/osteoporosis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why Simarro focuses on training women and encouraging them to lift heavier weights. “From the age of 30, we start slowly losing muscle mass too,” says Simarro. “It's part of the natural aging process and there's nothing we can do about that, but we can mitigate the effects of it. I want to be 70 or 80 and still doing cool stuff. It’s not just about adding 20 years to our lives: we want to live longer but live independently for as long as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-start-strength-training"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to start strength training&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, we know it’s important to be doing regular strength training, but if you’ve never picked up a kettlebell before, where should you start?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-J4vdAem39wmnp9jYDb3KcS" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-J4vdAem39wmnp9jYDb3KcS slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Start training with just your bodyweight,” says Simarro. Before you introduce weights to your training, you should make sure you are executing some of the fundamental movement patterns properly. If you don’t have your form nailed down, your risk of injury increases. “Once you feel confident in those movements, you can slowly start introducing weight," says Simarro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simarro encourages adults who are new to strength training to enlist the help of a personal trainer to ensure they’re getting their form right from the start. “If you couldn't swim, you would never jump into a pool without having a lesson,” says Simarro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if a personal trainer is too expensive, you can use your phone to film yourself and check your form that way. Online classes, like Simarro’s &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://buildingbodyconfidence.com/fitnessondemand" target="_blank" data-url="https://buildingbodyconfidence.com/fitnessondemand" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;on-demand strength workouts&lt;/a&gt;, can also be a good way to start if you’re not sure what exercises you should be doing. “It's a more affordable and accessible way to access strength training,” says Simarro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-long-should-you-train-for"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How long should you train for?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ideally&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;three 45-minute full-body strength sessions a week,” says Simarro. “However, I don't ever want people thinking if they don't hit that target there's no point because there is always a point. If you can only manage one strength training session a week, your bones and muscles will still benefit from that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simarro also points out that those three sessions can be shorter, so don't give up entirely if you can only manage 20 minutes or less. You are still moving and you are still going to be developing or maintaining muscle mass—it’ll just take a little longer to see the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-movements-should-you-focus-on"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What movements should you focus on?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are five movement patterns that Simarro recommends you incorporate into your training sessions once you've moved on to using weights, all of which are functional and should strengthen the muscles you use every day already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Squat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hinge&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Push&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pull&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rotation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we strength train, we want to incorporate each of those patterns into every workout ideally. So, I would do one squat, one hinge, a press away from me, such as a press-up, then [an overhead press] for shoulders, a pull, and then some sort of anti-rotation to work for the core,” says Simarro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-person-J4vdAem39wmnp9jYDb3KcS-j5hfgG8tCZdNhaERuu1tQs5STRMjolC8" class="slice-container person-wrapper

Here’s what to know.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DALLAS — Measles cases are spreading across Texas, with new warnings issued in San Antonio, New Braunfels and San Marcos. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of Health and Human Services reports 90 cases in the outbreak so far, with 16 patients hospitalized due to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some public health experts believe the number of actual cases is likely greater.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What you're seeing is the tip of the iceberg," said Dr. Diana Cervantes, Associate Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the University of North Texas Health Science Center.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is "probably the most infectious contagious disease on the planet," said Dr. Suzanne Whitworth,  Division Chief of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Cook Children's in Fort Worth. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know that about 40% of kids under the age of five who get measles are gonna wind up in the hospital, and nobody wants that," Whitworth said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started in &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measels-outbreak-cases-texas-gaines-county-terry-county-latest-update/269-99d838f0-1c2a-4589-8d18-cc288ea696e7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Gaines County on February 5 &lt;/a&gt;with someone who tested positive for measles and traveled to Texas State University, the &lt;a href="/article/news/local/university-texas-san-antonio-utsa-roadrunners-email-community-gaines-county-visitor-infected-contagious-measles-exposure-main-campus-tour/273-658835f6-2323-434c-88c3-743e2e4b3f68" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;University of Texas San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;, the Riverwalk and a Buc-ees over Valentine’s Day and the following weekend. Since then, Dawson, Ector, Lubbock, Lynn, Terry and Yoakum Counties have also reported measles cases. The virus has also crossed over to New Mexico which is reporting 9 cases.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is measles?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control, measles is a highly contagious virus that can be serious. In its definition, the CDC notes, “Anyone who is not protected against measles is at risk,” adding that two doses of the MMR vaccine provide the best protection against measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash with red, flat spots that begins on the face and spreads down to the rest of the body&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever, can spike to greater than 104&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How does it spread?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles spreads through infectious droplets and the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/vaccine-preventable-diseases/vaccine-preventable-disease-conditions/measles-rubeola" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt;. It’s important to note that the measles virus can remain infectious in the air up to two hours after an infected person leaves.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles don’t show up until a week, sometimes two weeks, after exposure. The challenge is that those infected are contagious about four days before any outward signs of the virus appear.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno, Director for Infection Prevention and Control at Children’s Medical Center Plano, shared, “The incubation period is about 8 to 14 days, but it can range from 7 to 21 days."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She adds, “You can have been exposed and infected with the measles and not have symptoms for up to 21 days and usually the person that contracts measles is contagious from 4 days before the onset of the rash until 4 days after the onset of the rash. So for those 8 days. However, the tricky thing here is that before you develop a rash, you can have symptoms that are very non-specific, like influenza-like. with cough, fever, congestion, and conjunctivitis. So you may think you have the flu and, it's measles and you may be spreading to all the vulnerable people without knowing that you have the measles.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What if I suspect I’ve been exposed to measles?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services provides guidance for those who believe they have been exposed to measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay home from work, school and other group settings until after the fourth day of the rash onset&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Isolate, especially if you are unvaccinated against measles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Call your doctor before you show up to get tested, so they can prepare&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unvaccinated kids shall be excluded from schools and childcare settings for at least 21 days from exposure to a measles case, according to the Texas Administrative Code&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get more information on how long kids will be out of school and when they can return to Texas &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/idps-home/school-communicable-disease-chart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;online here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitworth said a vaccinated person "should be fine" if they were on the college campuses or inside the restaurants or Buc-ees while the measles patients was there.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she suggests an unvaccinated or immunocompromised person contact their doctor for guidance..&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If fever, a runny nose, pink eye, or a rash develops within that 21-period but the illness isn't too severe, Whitworth suggests calling a provider before going to a clinic or emergency room in order to keep from exposing a waiting room to the virus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are the risks of measles?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles can cause serious health complications, especially in children younger than 5 years of age. Common complications are ear infections and diarrhea. Serious complications include pneumonia and encephalitis, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s the age group where most hospitalizations and complications have been described. Again, this will be mostly on those less than 5 years of age that have not been vaccinated. So historically, because measles was a disease that we rarely see, most of the adult people are already immune for prior vaccination because of the fact that there was no circulation," Dr. Carreno said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospitalization and complications during pregnancy are also documented risks of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to young children, those most at risk also include pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems, such as from leukemia or HIV infection.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is the recommended vaccine schedule?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, measles was eradicated in 2000 and has been rarely reported since then. The agency stresses that the best protection is the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC recommends all children get two doses of the MMR, or measles-mumps-rubella, vaccine with the first dose at 12 to 15 months of age and the second dose at 4 to 6 years of age. Children can also get the second dose earlier, at least 28 days following the first dose.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For students at post-high school educational institutions without the vaccine, a two-dose MMR vaccine is recommended, separated by at least 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adults who do not have the vaccine, at least one dose of MMR vaccine is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitworth suggests families with babies who are too young to receive the vaccine take extra precautions.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Make sure the parents; vaccines are up to date, make sure the siblings' vaccines are up to date. If grandparents are keeping those kids, make sure the grandparents' vaccines are up to date," she said. "Avoid any contact with people who have cough, runny nose, red eyes, or a rash. Avoid all ill contacts."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitworth reminds families the vaccine has saved countless lives.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is one of the routine immunizations and remember that this is one of the most contagious diseases. If you were exposed, make sure that you isolate yourself and monitor because you may even be incubating and you can pass it on even if you don't have symptoms or if you have not developed the rash. So I think awareness and keeping ourselves informed with good sources is the key at this time," Dr. Carreno said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
    &lt;/div&gt;

(WSBT) — &lt;/span&gt;Bird flu has struck Fish Lake, as hundreds of birds, including a significant number of sandhill cranes, have dropped dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the community is working to dispose of the carcasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sandhill cranes are migrating north.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But unlike other years, they are being met with a new obstacle: bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“The sandhill cranes this year are being affected by avian influenza. We've had several mortalities across the state of Indiana in multiple different counties,” said Eli Fleace, Indiana DNR Avian Health Specialist.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the DNR, nearly 1500 sandhill cranes have died in Indiana so far in Green County, Union County, Jasper County, La Porte County, and Starke County from Bird Flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first time the flu has hit the cranes this hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first time that H5N1 has caused a mortality event in the cranes at this scale. There may have been someone or two cranes that have died in the past from avian influenza, but this year it really hit them,” said Fleace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of sandhill cranes have been migrating through Fish Lake in the past couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But well over 100 made the lake their final resting spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Well, we had a big migration of birds between 2,000 to 4,000 sand cranes that flew in both in two to three weeks ago. And as that transpired, a couple started washing in,” said Sean Leone, Fish Lake resident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leone was saddened to look out to see the lifeless birds but knew they needed to be picked up to avoid foul smells and vultures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DNR doesn't have the capacity to pick up the dead birds, so Leone felt called to step up and help out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And I decided, you know, someone's got to do something about it and pick up these birds. So, I started getting volunteers together and asking people if they'd like to donate bags or gloves or whatever to help, you know, bring you into the community and everybody helps chip in and do their part,” said Leone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leone has picked up around 30 dead birds so far. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fleece with the DNR said the risk to humans for avian influenza is still considered low, but shared tips to Leone on how to dispose of the birds safely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just told him to make sure that he and his volunteers are wearing disposable gloves, masks, they're double bagging these birds, putting them in the trash and then disinfecting any equipment that they use, including trailers, your shovels or forks or anything like that, says Eli Fleace, Indiana DNR Avian Health Specialist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in volunteering with Leone you can contact him at Iwantchangetoday@gmail.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.in.gov/boah/species-information/avianbirds/small-flock-and-exhibition-poultry/sick-andor-dead-poultry-questionnaire/" target="_blank" title="https://www.in.gov/boah/species-information/avianbirds/small-flock-and-exhibition-poultry/sick-andor-dead-poultry-questionnaire/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;The DNR is urging anyone who finds sick or dead birds to report them.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WSBT-TV</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 01:50:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Some Antidepressants Could Speed Decline in Dementia Patients - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPcnZrR3FyMDkxU0MwUU1BRHpnd01XOHdVNjJubXVObFE5NWxDRGV0ZnpSR3ZMTlJSLTcwbkVhS0M5eTZDR1J5T3BKeUJFeDNCeTh2TERfMWhjMHQzWXZmcEZFNDRyMmRBaU9UNmN0a2J4SzIzR3kxVm42ZFd4MGRKR1F5aG1FSmVaTkhiYW1lYzlDMmVn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Dementia is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-isnt-the-only-form-of-dementia-an-expert-explains-the-differences"&gt;typically associated&lt;/a&gt; with severe loss of memory and cognitive function. It's often accompanied by a variety of other psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety, sleep loss, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="153035" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new population-based study led by researchers from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden has found a common first-line class of medications prescribed to dementia patients for depression could be hastening their cognitive decline, while also putting individuals at greater risk of fractures and an earlier death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though other factors can't be conclusively ruled out, the possibility that some antidepressants might worsen an underlying condition may be important for medical specialists treating dementia patients to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/ssris/art-20044825"&gt;Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; (SSRIs) and &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/antidepressants/art-20044970"&gt;serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; (SNRIs) are considered the first choice in antidepressants thanks to having relatively few side effects. Yet &lt;a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3266805/v1"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; has identified an association between the inhibitors and an increased risk of dementia in older adults, compared with psychotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unsurprising that &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.13807"&gt;some classes&lt;/a&gt; of antidepressants risk interfering with processes responsible for our ability to think and recall our past. However, SSRIs have been considered &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-antidepressants-may-have-another-surprising-effect-on-your-brain"&gt;to be largely helpful&lt;/a&gt; in protecting brains from neurodegeneration, even linked to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1107411108"&gt;reducing plaques&lt;/a&gt; thought to play a role in damaging brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reconciling these seemingly contradictory findings in the population has itself failed to reveal a definitive answer, potentially because of the type of data collected and limitations in the way results were gathered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their comprehensive analysis, Karolinska Institute neurobiologist Minjia Mo and colleagues used a nationwide Swedish register of medical data collected from newly diagnosed dementia patients between 2007 and 2018. A total of 18,740 patients were included, with just over 20 percent being recently prescribed at least one antidepressant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of those individual drug prescriptions, just under two-thirds were some form of SSRI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found a clear relationship between that medication and severe dementia, with anything more than a standard daily dose predicting an increase of nearly half a point in dementia assessment scores per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153044" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153044" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/graph_mmse_dementia_score.jpg" alt="graph of cognitive decline and ssris" class="wp-image-153044 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/graph_mmse_dementia_score.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/graph_mmse_dementia_score-612x415.jpg 612w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/graph_mmse_dementia_score-600x407.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153044" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mini–mental state examination scores taken over three years, comparing antidepressant use with non-use in dementia patients. (Mo et al., &lt;em&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the observational nature of the study and its inherent limitations, it's plausible that other factors could be influencing the relationship, making it difficult to draw a clear line between the antidepressant dose and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact patients are already experiencing cognitive decline makes the outcome especially challenging to analyze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However the researchers also found a concerning rise in the risk of fractures that could be associated with higher SSRI doses, which may indicate unwanted neurological interference too, as do their results hinting at an increase in all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study failed to find any such link with SNRIs, suggesting differences in their mechanisms or possibly a limitation in the study itself. Future research could provide clarity on the risks and benefits of each class of antidepressant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note changes to medication must only be undertaken in consultation with a doctor. Physicians and specialists in dementia care take a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antidepressants-could-trigger-some-cases-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome"&gt;variety of risks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antidepressants-are-linked-with-less-risk-of-dying-from-covid-19-study-finds"&gt;potential benefits&lt;/a&gt; into account when prescribing individual patients with a treatment plan and when modifying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tailoring combinations of medication and dosages means considering their overall prognosis, making studies like these essential in striking the right balance in easing the anguish that comes with cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-025-03851-3"&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dozens of NIH study sections — meetings in which panels of expert scientists consider which research projects the agency should support — have been canceled in recent weeks, after the Trump administration barred the NIH from posting any new notices to the Federal Register as part of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/22/trump-administration-orders-health-communications-pause-cdc-hhs-fda/"&gt;a freeze on communications &lt;/a&gt;across health agencies. By law, notices of study section meetings must appear in the Federal Register at least 15 days in advance of assembly. No notice, no meeting. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Monday, NIH employees within the Office of the Director were told that Federal Register notices for study sections run by the agency’s Center for Scientific Review — which reviews most major academic research grants, fellowships, and small business grants — will start being permitted again, according to an email reviewed by STAT. However, it appears that notices of meetings of advisory councils, which provide additional review and make final funding recommendations, will not. &lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts public health officials issued an advisory to health care providers, cautioning that the state is seeing a “possible increase” in the number of children experiencing neurological complications associated with the flu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/influenza-neurologic-complications-advisory-february-14-2025-0/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;clinical advisory dated Feb. 14&lt;/a&gt;, the Department of Public Health said it is investigating reports of children experiencing neurological complications alongside the flu, noting that similar increases are being seen elsewhere across the country. The most common flu-related neurological complication is seizure, followed by encephalopathy or encephalitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At this time, it is not clear why increased cases of neurological complications associated with influenza are being observed this season,” officials wrote to providers. “One possible explanation is that we are experiencing a relatively high rate of influenza, yielding higher than typical number of cases with complications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that flu strain circulating this year offers a higher risk or that the affected population has a higher risk for the complications than before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have suggested that children with pre-existing neurological disorders or those who are unvaccinated against the flu may be at higher risk for neurological complications from influenza, according to the advisory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although children with chronic neurological conditions are particularly vulnerable to influenza complicated by neurologic symptoms, most children with neurologic complications of influenza do not have chronic conditions,” officials said in the advisory. “Hospital length of stay, rate of ICU admission and death are greater in children with neurologic complications of influenza compared with those without these complications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those that survive the severest neurological complications are “likely to have substantial persistent health impacts,” according to the advisory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the apparent increase of the complications, the department is recommending clinicians consider “urgent” neurology and infectious disease consultation for pediatric patients showing new neurological symptoms with a recent flu infection or flu-like illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Symptoms can include new onset seizures, mental status changes, new onset ataxia, catatonia, mutism and severe lethargy,” the state said. “Include testing for influenza in the medical evaluation of these patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care providers are being urged to ensure pediatric patients are vaccinated against the flu. They are also being asked to report to the state if any patients under the age of 21 have new onset neurological symptoms and a positive flu test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The severity of the flu in Massachusetts is &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/influenza-reporting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;currently “very high,”&lt;/a&gt; according to DPH. The state has been seeing a level of flu infections that &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/02/11/the-severity-of-the-flu-in-mass-is-very-high-heres-what-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hasn’t been seen since before COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; for the 2024-2025 flu season. While infections for last week were down slightly from the spike at the beginning of February, infection levels and hospitalizations for the illness remain elevated. So far this season, 191 people have died from the flu in Massachusetts, including six children, according to the state.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON — The findings of a new Texas health report say a 250-square mile area of east Harris County is a cancer cluster. Some residents believe it may be linked to decades-old hazardous waste pits in the San Jacinto River.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The residents hope the report will motivate the EPA to force the landowners to clean the site up.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene Hennigan, who has have lived in the Highlands along the San Jacinto River for decades, has experienced great loss. He says it’s due to the waste pits’ impact on the nearby environment.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My son Jeff, who played and swam in these waters...he fished as a kid and has died from two types of lung cancer,” Hennigan said. His wife also got breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worry from parents like Hennigan and other residents in the area prompted a request to the Texas Department of State Health Services to study cancer cases around the area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/CHI-ESTB/DSHS%2520East%2520Harris%2520County%2520Cancer%2520Assessment%2520-%2520Summary%2520Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;In a summary—the report says leukemia, lung and bronchus, and lymphoma cancers&lt;/a&gt; were statistically significantly greater than expected. Although, the study says it was not intending to look for causes of the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While the findings are not surprising to those living in the shadow of contamination they are a sad vindication for what far too many of us have experienced," Jackie Medcalf with the Texas Health and Environment Alliance said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now the community knows this information does it help with early detection, what is it that can be possibly done to help the communities here?” &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medcalf, whose group requested the study—is hoping to meet with the EPA to hurry the cleanup process at the waste pit sites.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The pressure point right now is to tell the EPA to tell the irresponsible parties to get out here and clean it up,” Harris County Precinct 3 commissioner Tom Ramsey is hoping the state and the EPA will step in. Residents like Hennigan are hoping for progress to be made.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Develop a schedule for completion with milestones, have penalties for not meeting those milestones, and watch them get this done before we lose another hundred lives,” Hennigan said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group who requested the study plans to seek further refined data about cancer cases in this area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KHOU 11 has reached out to the EPA for comment about the findings and we are waiting for a response.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="tgnaNewNode"&gt;What is the San Jacinto River Waste Pits Superfund Site?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The San Jacinto River Waste Pits Superfund site, located in Harris County, Texas (Figure 1), consists of two sets of impoundments, or pits, built in the mid-1960s for disposing solid and liquid pulp and paper mill wastes that are contaminated with dioxins and furans. The northern set of impoundments, about 14 acres in size, are located on the western bank of the San Jacinto River, north of the Interstate 10 (I-10) bridge over the San Jacinto River.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report released Monday does not link the cause of the cancer cluster to the superfund site.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Benefits and a non-existent risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an adjusted odds ratio, the researchers found that vaccination reduced the likelihood of developing long COVID with one or more symptoms by 57 percent, and reduced the likelihood of developing long COVID with two or more symptoms by 73 percent. Vaccination prior to infection was also linked to a 75 percent reduction in risk of developing long COVID that impacted day-to-day functioning. The authors note that the estimates of protection are likely underestimates because the calculations do not account for the fact that vaccination prevented some children from getting infected in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that children should stay up to date with current COVID-19 vaccination recommendations as vaccination not only protects against severe COVID-19 illness but also protects against [long Covid]," the authors conclude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second short report in JAMA Network Open, researchers helped dispel concern that the vaccines could cause sudden cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death in young athletes. This is an unproven claim that was fueled by anti-vaccine advocates amid the pandemic, including the new US Health Secretary and long-time &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-kennedy-election-vaccines-2ccde2df146f57b5e8c26e8494f0a16a"&gt;anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7314a5.htm"&gt;previous analyses&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.063753"&gt;failed to find a link&lt;/a&gt; between COVID-19 vaccines and sudden cardiac deaths, the new study took a broader approach. The study, led by researchers at the University of Washington, looked at whether the number of sudden cardiac arrests (SCA) and sudden cardiac deaths (SCD) among young athletes changed at all during the pandemic (2020–2022) compared with prior years (2017–2019). The researchers drew records from the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research. They also collected medical records and autopsy reports on cases among competitive athletes from the youth, middle school, high school, club, college, or professional levels who experienced sudden cardiac arrest or death at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, there were 387 cases, with no statistically significant difference in the number of cases in the years prior to the pandemic (203) compared with those during the pandemic (184).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This cohort study found no increase in SCA/SCD in young competitive athletes in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that reports asserting otherwise were overestimating the cardiovascular risk of COVID-19 infection, vaccination, and myocarditis," the authors conclude.&lt;/p&gt;

Beans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you prefer garbanzo beans, black beans or kidney beans, these are the perfect little package of fiber-plus-protein. “I love adding &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/food-recipes/cooking/g60215479/types-of-beans/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:different types of beans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;different types of beans&lt;/a&gt; to soups, salads, stews, pasta sauce, casseroles, dips or rice dishes to boost the protein and fiber content,” says Gaw. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/175238/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Half a cup of cooked black beans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Half a cup of cooked black beans&lt;/a&gt; contains around 7 g protein and 8 g fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Brown rice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you're craving a base for stir fries, burritos or protein bowls, skip the white stuff and choose &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a41951427/brown-vs-white-rice/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brown rice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brown rice&lt;/a&gt; instead, suggests Gaw: It's a whole grain that is higher in both protein and fiber than its refined cousin. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/169704/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Half a cup of brown rice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Half a cup of brown rice&lt;/a&gt; has 2.75 g protein and just under 2 g fiber.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Chia seeds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;kajakiki - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, if you asked the average person about chia, they would probably only know them as &lt;a href="https://www.chia.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the source of hair on a gag gift;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the source of hair on a gag gift&lt;/a&gt;. But now, the &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a63785578/are-chia-seeds-really-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:highly nutritious little seeds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;highly nutritious little seeds&lt;/a&gt; are everywhere — as the base of puddings, mixed into smoothies, sprinkled on salads. And for good reason: Not only are they tasty, but just &lt;a href="https://tools.myfooddata.com/nutrition-facts/100052928/wt1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:1 tablespoon of chia seeds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; 1 tablespoon of chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; has around and &lt;br&gt;1.7 g of protein and 3.4 g fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Quinoa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a nutty, chewy flavor that works equally well in soups, stews, salads and bowls, quinoa is an easy way for vegetarians and vegans to get a good dose of protein. “Quinoa is one of the few complete plant proteins, meaning it contains all of the essential protein building blocks that your body needs,” says Militano. “I love using quinoa as a foundation to a breakfast bowl with cinnamon, berries, peanut butter and a drizzle of maple syrup. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/168917/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Just half a cup of quinoa;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Just half a cup of quinoa&lt;/a&gt; will give you 4 g of protein and 2.6 g fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Broccoli&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just beans and grains that double up on protein and fiber. With 2.6 g protein and 2.4 g fiber per &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170379/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cup of chopped broccoli;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cup of chopped broccoli&lt;/a&gt;, the ubiquitous green veggie is a great source of the two important nutrients. Militano suggests adding it to an omelette, which gives you an &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/food-recipes/healthy/g61490064/high-fiber-breakfast-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:extra fiber boost with your breakfast;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;extra fiber boost with your breakfast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Edamame&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;thesomegirl - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who doesn't love popping a chewy soybean out of the pod and into your mouth — the protein-packed beans are as addictive as popcorn, and &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/168411/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a half cup of edamame;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a half cup of edamame&lt;/a&gt; has around 9.2 g protein and 4 g fiber. Roasted edamame is a perfect on-the-go snack that comes in a variety of flavors, says Militano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Oats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most comforting breakfast on a cold winter day is also a great choice for protein and fiber. “Oats are so versatile and are a wonderful source of fiber and plant-based protein. One of my favorite breakfasts is a savory oat bowl with eggs, cheese and veggies,” says Militano. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/172989/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Half a cup of oats contains;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Half a cup of oats contains&lt;/a&gt; 5.5 g protein and 3.8 g fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Sweet potatoes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether baked, roasted or sliced into fries, sweet potatoes are known as one of the best ways to get vitamin A — but they can also help bump up your protein and fiber intake for the day. A &lt;a href="https://www.ces.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NC-HOTM-Sweet-Potatoes-English.pdf?fwd=no" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:half cup of baked sweet potato;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;half cup of baked sweet potato&lt;/a&gt; has 2 g protein and 3 g fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is everywhere these days—the keto and paleo diet trends are still going strong, and you can fill your shopping cart with all kinds of unusual products, including chips made from chicken and protein-infused beer. And while we know protein is a crucial part of your diet, focusing solely on this macronutrient can put you at risk being low in another important nutrient/ If you are focusing on steak, chicken, and other animal-based proteins, you may be missing out on fiber. “Since animal foods don’t contain fiber, both fiber and protein can only be found in plant foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes,” says Sheri Gaw, RDN, owner of &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/sheridietitian.com/__;!!Ivohdkk!h7Rt5E0BhGEg8hpG6qgAOUN0NSLFKsxPilNWX_ikalbzomkto063PUR_qU2w6dnm-dsEgbu8p9_McXtT93in$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sheri the Plant Strong Dietitian;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sheri the Plant Strong Dietitian &lt;/a&gt;in the Bay Area. And getting plenty of fiber is crucial, she adds, because it supports heart health, weight management, gut health, blood sugar control. Getting sufficient fiber also lowers your risk for certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While your fiber and protein needs vary based on your size, physical activity, and age, there are some basic guidelines: &lt;br&gt;“Most active individuals benefit from 20 to 30 grams of protein per meal and 5 to 15 grams per snack,” says Stephanie Militano, RD, a registered sports nutritionist and owner of SM Nutrition in Williamsburg, VA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, nutritionists recommend 10 delicious, versatile foods that give you the double whammy or fiber and protein:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 23:46:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFBuYjd4RkpjWXJLbnR6N1dCSXJzU21aZ0dISVoySFZnM1liRktvR3M2M0U5M29JQjVyU0tTQ1loYi1za2c2bHJVNldQcDB1TTVFOEVfTlNRTkFLWXZkWUdYMDBDQUp5eVJhV1B1c05n</guid></item></channel></rss>
