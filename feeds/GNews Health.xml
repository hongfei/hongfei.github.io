This detailed map, created using cryo-electron microscopy, reveals how sweeteners bind to a key receptor component, TAS1R2, which resembles a Venus flytrap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery could enable the development of new molecules that better regulate or reduce sugar cravings, potentially helping combat obesity and diabetes. Unlike current artificial sweeteners, which were discovered by chance and often fail to curb sugar desire, this structural breakthrough offers a rational path to designing better alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural Breakthrough:&lt;/strong&gt; First high-resolution map (2.8 angstroms) of the human sweet taste receptor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sweet Binding Pocket:&lt;/strong&gt; Identifies how molecules like sucralose and aspartame bind to trigger sweetness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Applications:&lt;/strong&gt; May lead to better sugar substitutes and insights into metabolic health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Zuckerman Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our attraction to sugar has grown to an unhealthy level. The average person in the United States now consumes more than 100 pounds of the sweet stuff every year, up from 18 pounds in 1800.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With new research published May 7, in &lt;em&gt;Cell,&lt;/em&gt; Columbia University scientists have taken a major step toward dealing with this public health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109714"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman eating a sugar cube." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The new work maps the structure of the human sweet taste receptor in unprecedented detail, to a resolution as good as 2.8 angstroms. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, they have mapped the 3-D structure of the human sweet taste receptor, the molecular machine that allows us to taste sweet things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could lead to the discovery of new regulators of the receptor that would significantly alter our attraction to and appetite for sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The leading role that sugar plays in obesity cannot be overlooked,” said study co-first author Juen Zhang, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Charles Zuker, PhD, at Columbia’s Zuckerman Institute and at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The artificial sweeteners that we use today to replace sugar just don’t meaningfully change our desire for sugar. Now that we know what the receptor looks like, we might be able to design something better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sweet receptors on our tongue can detect a large number of different chemicals that taste sweet, from common table sugar (also known as sucrose) to antimicrobial enzymes in chicken eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other receptors—for bitter, sour, or other tastes—our sweet sensors evolved to not be very sensitive. This helps us focus on sugar-rich foods for energy, and drives a need for a lot of sweets to satisfy our sweet tooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determining the structure of the human sweet receptor is key to comprehending how it helps us detect sweet taste, fundamentally advancing our understanding of taste perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 20 years ago, Dr. Zuker and his colleagues uncovered the genes behind the mammalian sweet taste receptor. This landmark work revealed its chemical formula, but until now no one knew its precise shape, much like how knowing a cake’s recipe will not tell you what the pastry will look like when finished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without this knowledge, understanding the molecular basis of sweet detection to rationally design ways to regulate the function of this essential receptor has been a challenge, said Dr. Zuker, in whose laboratory this new work was also carried out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “All the artificial sweeteners that we use today were either discovered by accident or based on known sweet-tasting molecules,” said study co-author Brian Wang, a research assistant in the Zuker lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a result, most artificial sweeteners have drawbacks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new work maps the structure of the human sweet taste receptor in unprecedented detail, to a resolution as good as 2.8 angstroms. In comparison, the smallest atom, hydrogen, is slightly more than 1 angstrom wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took the researchers innovative approaches and about three years to map the human sweet taste receptor’s structure, in large part because it proved difficult to grow this protein on cells in lab dishes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just getting the purified protein we needed to map the structure took more than 150 different preparations over the course of three years,” said study co-first author Zhengyuan Lu, a doctoral student at the Zuker lab. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists then used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to analyze the human sweet taste receptor. This technique fires beams of electrons at molecules that have been frozen in solution, helping researchers capture snapshots of those molecules from different perspectives, from which they can reconstruct their three-dimensional structures at the atomic level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of particular importance, cryo-EM revealed the receptor’s binding pocket: the cavity where sweet things stick and trigger the set of reactions that drive our strong appetite for sweets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Defining the binding pocket of this receptor very accurately is absolutely vital to understanding its function,” said study co-author Anthony Fitzpatrick, PhD, a principal investigator at Columbia’s Zuckerman Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By knowing its exact shape, we can see why sweeteners attach to it, and how to make or find better molecules that activate the receptor or regulate its function,” added Dr. Fitzpatrick, who is also an assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular biophysics at Columbia’s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human sweet taste receptor consists of two main halves. One of these, named TAS1R2, possesses the binding pocket, a component resembling a Venus flytrap. Knowing the structure of this part may also help us understand why people differ in how sensitive they are to sweets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists mapped the receptor’s structure as it bound to two of the most commonly used artificial sweeteners, aspartame and sucralose. These are, respectively, 200 and 600 times sweeter than sucrose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then systematically altered tiny parts of the receptor. This helped shed light on the role each of these parts play in binding onto the sweeteners, said study co-author Ruihuan Yu, a doctoral student at the Zuker lab. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to move our understanding of science forward to be able to help people,” said study co-author Andrew Chang, a research technician at the Fitzpatrick lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the human sweet taste receptor is found mostly on taste buds in the mouth, Dr. Zhang noted it is also scattered throughout the body, where it may play a role in the function of organs such as the pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, the new map of this receptor’s structure might support research investigating our metabolism, as well as in disorders such as diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#19777c6e6a596370377a76756c747b7078377c7d6c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Zuckerman Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://zi.columbia.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Zuckerman Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Zuckerman Communications – Zuckerman Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.04.021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Structure of Human Sweetness&lt;/a&gt;” by Andrew Chang et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Structure of Human Sweetness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, the detection and ultimately the perception of sweetness begin in the oral cavity, where taste receptor cells (TRCs) dedicated to sweet-sensing interact with sugars, artificial sweeteners, and other sweet-tasting chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human sweet TRCs express on their cell surface a sweet receptor that initiates the cascade of signaling events responsible for our strong attraction to sweet stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we describe the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the human sweet receptor bound to two of the most widely used artificial sweeteners—sucralose and aspartame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results reveal the structural basis for sweet detection, provide insights into how a single receptor mediates all our responses to such a wide range of sweet-tasting compounds, and open up unique possibilities for designing a generation of taste modulators informed by the structure of the human receptor.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Wegovy and Ozempic work by triggering the body to produce a hormone called GLP-1 that is released naturally from the intestines after meals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Karen Coe, 59, started taking Mounjaro to manage her type-2 diabetes, but just three days later she started to experience serious side-effects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; In the UK, 82 fatalities have been reported to regulators—again, with no confirmed links. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic and Wegovy contain the active ingredient semaglutide, which mimics glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)— a naturally occurring hormone released in the small intestine when eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The chemical signals to the brain when you are full and slows digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This keeps people feeling fuller for longer and dramatically reduces appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also slows the liver's production of sugar, forcing the body to burn stored fat for energy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since being approved for weight-loss in November 2023, Mounjaro, which contains a GLP-1 drug similar to semaglutide, has already been linked to 209 adverse reactions, one of which was fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For all of these drugs, the second most common complaint was fatigue, followed by headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Less common side-effects include menstruation bleeding, joint pain and abnormal heart rhythms. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Coe was rushed to hospital after experiencing blood clots, cramping and headaches, which she believes to be a side-effect of the skinny jab&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Karen Coe, 59, who was taking Mounjaro to treat her type 2 diabetes, said that being on the weight loss drug felt like 'being ripped open by a knife'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just three days after her first injection, Ms Coe started to experience side-effects.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At first I had a headache and got dizzy,' she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had a few stomach cramps. On Monday it was excruciating. I nearly passed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had to ask my husband to call for an ambulance. I was dizzy and really cold. they did my observation and said it was all okay.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Coe was sent home and told to monitor her symptoms. She spent the next 24 hours in excruciating pain with stomach cramps and passing blood when she went to the toilet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite her symptoms initially clearing up, a week later she was rushed to hospital after experiencing 'massive blood clots'. She was then referred to a colorectal surgeon within the next two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While doctors could not say that the blood clots were caused by the weigh loss drug, it is likely that her initial symptoms were caused by Mounjaro. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Coe is now urging people to consider the potential side-effects of the popular jab—which the NHS lists as nausea, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps—before taking it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It can cause severe reactions and severe side effects. People should really think carefully and don't take it lightly' she warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In response, Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical company that makes Mounjaro, said: 'patients safety is our top priority.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health disorders affect more than 400 million people around the world. Stress disorders such as anxiety and depression are among the leading causes of disability worldwide. Prolonged cortisol elevation is linked to numerous mental health disorders, including depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UC researchers created a lab-on-a-chip system to track a patient’s cortisol levels. It consists of a disposable collection device that a person puts in their mouth which is then inserted into a reader. The reader can transmit results in minutes to a portable analyzer and smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Biomedical Microdevices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mental health care can be an urgent situation. And so these tests will help doctors make timely interventions,” Ahn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients can do the testing themselves and share results with doctors with a web app, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study co-author UC doctoral student Supreeth Setty is working on a related project for his dissertation that examines another hormone (dehydroepiandrosterone) that goes by the acronym DHEA. That hormone helps to counteract the effects of too much cortisol in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that high ratios of cortisol to DHEA are indicators of chronic stress associated with conditions such as depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setty said the tests provide clinicians with objective evidence to supplement traditional screenings such as the patient health questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Point-of-care testing is a practical way to make results available quickly for everyone,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike mental health questionnaires that can be more subjective because they rely on a patient’s candor and self-awareness, the cortisol and DHEA tests are objective and can raise a red flag about a patient’s levels of stress, Setty said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next step would be to collaborate with psychiatrists and conduct clinical trials to see if our platform works as expected,” Setty said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UC doctoral graduate Vinitha Thiyagarajan Upaassana was the lead author of the study with Setty and co-author and UC doctoral student Heeyong Jang. The project was partially funded by UC’s Technology Accelerator Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UC researchers say their technique can be used to diagnose other health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, they examined troponin, a protein that gets released into the bloodstream when patients suffer damage to their hearts from conditions such as a heart attack. The amount of the protein released depends on how much damage the heart sustains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High cardiac troponin levels in combination with symptoms such as chest pain can indicate a heart attack in progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a paper published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Analytical Chemistry&lt;/em&gt;, Jang, Setty and Ahn unveiled an innovative new device for a rapid and effective point-of-care biochemical test that measures troponin from a drop of blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once you survive a heart attack there is an increased probability of having another heart attack,” Jang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can monitor troponin in the blood on a daily basis and hopefully get valuable information. The test provides immediate results, which is important when a patient is in need of immediate care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this depression and neurotech research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a1ccc8c2c9c0c4cd8fccc8cdcdc4d392e1d4c28fc4c5d4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Michael Miller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Michael Miller – University of Cincinnati&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10544-025-00733-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;On-site analysis of cortisol in saliva based on microchannel lateral flow assay on polymer lab-on-a-chip&lt;/a&gt;” by Chong Ahn et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biomedical Microdevices&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On-site analysis of cortisol in saliva based on microchannel lateral flow assay on polymer lab-on-a-chip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unbound cortisol in saliva, detectable through non-invasive sampling, is widely recognized as a validated biomarker for the biochemical evaluation of common mental disorders such as chronic stress, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this work, we report a novel polymer lab-on-a-chip (LOC) for microfluidic lateral flow assay (mLFA) with on-chip dried reagents for the detection of unbound cortisol in saliva using a competitive immunoassay protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new polymer microchannel lateral flow assay on lab-on-a-chip (mLFA-LOC), replicated using injection molding technology, are composed of sequentially connected microchannels for sample loading, detection antibody immobilization, flow delay, sensing spirals for test and control, and a capillary pump at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The competitive immunoassay of cortisol can be autonomously performed through the microchannels after sample loading of the filtered saliva, and the fluorescence signals emitted from the sensing spirals are detected and quantified by a custom-designed, portable fluorescence analyzer developed in this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the evaluation of cortisol assay, artificial saliva samples spiked with unbound cortisol were analyzed using mLFA-LOC and the portable analyzer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The performed competitive assay of unbound cortisol showed a limit of detection (LoD) of 1.8 ng/mL and an inter-chip coefficient of variation (CV) of 4.0%, which covers the clinical range for on-site unbound salivary cortisol analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly developed mLFA-LOC platform certainly works successfully for the rapid on-site sampling and analysis of salivary biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;

The report estimated that this year, 13,360 women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer and about 4,320 women will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, the number of women getting screened has fallen since the mid-2000s. A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2788175" target="_blank"&gt;2022 study &lt;/a&gt;found that 23% of women were behind on their cervical cancer screening in 2019, up from 14% in 2005. Up to half of women diagnosed with cervical cancer in the U.S. weren’t up to date on their screenings, the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/research/acs-research-news/cervical-cancer-leads-cancer-deaths-37-countries.html" target="_blank"&gt;American Cancer Society says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Cervical cancer screening in general is something that saves lives,” said Dr. Jessica Kiley, chief of general obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The new test, called the Teal Wand, detects HPV using a vaginal swab, making it less invasive than a pap smear, in which the gynecologist inserts a speculum and collects samples of cells from the cervix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;HPV, or human papillomavirus, is a sexually transmitted infection and the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/hpv-can-cause-cancer-many-people-dont-realize-rcna79597" target="_blank"&gt;leading cause of cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt;. There’s no treatment for HPV, but most cases clear on their own. Several strains, however, are linked to cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Teal Wand is not the first HPV test that uses a vaginal sample: Last year, the FDA approved a similar swab, also performed by patients themselves, that’s &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/fda-hpv-test-self-collection-health-care-setting" target="_blank"&gt;collected in a doctor’s office&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“What’s different about this new indication is that this sample can be collected at home and not in a medical setting,” said Dr. George Sawaya, a gynecologist at UCSF Health. “You have to logically believe that would increase access if people’s main barrier was getting to a medical setting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A recent report in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830824" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt; found that women in rural areas are 25% more likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer and 42% more likely to die from the disease than women who live in cities, a trend that likely reflects lower access to screenings and care in rural parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Patients will be able to order the test kit after a telehealth appointment with a doctor and then collect the sample themselves at home. For now, the product will have to be prescribed by one of Teal Health’s virtual providers, but the company plans to make it available for other doctors to order as well. The swab is then mailed to a lab for analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Teal Health said if the result is positive, its providers will help arrange for further care. Following a positive test, women may need additional tests in a doctor’s office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Still, experts want more information on the cost of the test, and whether patients will follow up if they need more testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Those are some of the uncertainties around it,” Sawaya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kara Egan, the CEO of Teal Health, did not say how much the test would cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, she said, because cervical cancer screening is endorsed by a government group called the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the company is anticipating the test will be covered by insurance and expects to know definitively in the coming months. In December, the task force endorsed in-office self-swabs in a draft recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Kiley, the gynecologist from Northwestern, said it’s still important that women see a gynecologist regularly.

These findings advocate for early intervention strategies, including maternal lifestyle changes and routine blood pressure screenings in children, even when no current health issues are apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prenatal Risk Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Children born to mothers with at least one cardiometabolic risk factor had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure percentiles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster BP Growth:&lt;/strong&gt; Blood pressure rose more quickly from ages 2 to 18 in children exposed to maternal risk factors during pregnancy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disparities Noted:&lt;/strong&gt; Effects were more pronounced in girls and Black children, suggesting potential social and biological interactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;USC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children born to mothers with obesity, gestational diabetes mellitus or a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy have higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure than children born to mothers without these risk factors, according to a new USC study. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among children whose mothers had at least one risk factor, blood pressure also rose more quickly between ages 2 and 18 compared to their peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109694"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a child." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;At their first blood pressure reading, children born to mothers with any cardiometabolic risk factor ranked in a higher SBP percentile (4.88 points higher, on average) and DBP percentile (1.09 points higher, on average) than their peers born to mothers with no risk factors. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, which suggest that blood pressure interventions could start as early as pregnancy, were just published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the country, heart health is declining, with hypertension affecting more people—and showing up earlier in life. Growing evidence indicates that blood pressure levels may be shaped by early development, even before birth. But most research on maternal and child heart health has looked at risk factors individually, rather than exploring their combined role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from the Keck School of Medicine of USC has examined links and interactions between a mother’s cardiometabolic health during pregnancy and her child’s blood pressure up to age 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included nearly 30 years of data from 12, 480 mother-child pairs across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We still have so much to learn about how we can prevent the development of cardiovascular disease,” said Shohreh Farzan, PhD, associate professor of population and public health sciences at the Keck School of Medicine and the study’s senior author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Finding factors that we can address during pregnancy and childhood—and implementing early interventions—may be key to changing the trajectories of health for future generations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funded by the National Institutes of Health, Farzan and her colleagues found that children born to mothers with at least one cardiometabolic risk factor had a systolic blood pressure (SBP) that averaged 4.88 percentile points higher than children whose mothers had no risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) averaged 1.90 percentile points higher. Children born to mothers with one or more risk factors also had a faster increase in blood pressure between ages 2 and 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings can help shape prevention efforts on both ends of the equation, including lifestyle changes for women of childbearing age and earlier blood pressure screenings for at-risk children, said Zhongzheng (Jason) Niu, PhD, the study’s first author, a Presidential Sustainability Solutions Fellow at USC and assistant professor of epidemiology and environmental health at the University at Buffalo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood pressure percentiles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used data collected between January 1994 and March 2023 through the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program. The data include demographic and health information on 12,480 mother-child pairs from across the country, about half of whom identified as non-white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of the mothers in the study (5,537, or 44.4%) had at least one cardiometabolic risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity was the most common, affecting 3,072 mothers (24.6%), followed by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, which include gestational hypertension, preeclampsia and other conditions (1,693 mothers, or 13.6%) and gestational diabetes mellitus (805 mothers, or 6.5%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For children, researchers used blood pressure readings to calculate SBP and DBP percentiles, which estimate how a child’s blood pressure compares to that of peers who are the same age, sex and height.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then conducted a statistical analysis to examine how maternal risk factors related to blood pressure in their offspring down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They accounted for other variables that could influence the results, including maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, income, number of previous pregnancies and smoking during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elevated blood pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At their first blood pressure reading, children born to mothers with any cardiometabolic risk factor ranked in a higher SBP percentile (4.88 points higher, on average) and DBP percentile (1.09 points higher, on average) than their peers born to mothers with no risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children born to mothers with two risk factors faced even higher blood pressure. For example, when mothers had both obesity and a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, their children had SBP that averaged 7.31 points higher and DBP that averaged 4.04 points higher than children whose mothers had no risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects were more pronounced in female compared to male offspring and in Black children compared to other racial and ethnic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the children in the study, 6,015 had at least two blood pressure readings, which allowed researchers to assess how maternal risks related to changes in a child’s blood pressure over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that SBP (0.5 points/year) and DBP (0.7 points/year) rose more quickly between ages 2 and 18 in children whose mother had at least one risk factor, compared to children whose mother had no risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screening and prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings show that on top of directly benefiting women, better cardiovascular health during the childbearing years can also support health in the next generation, Niu said. A 2025 statement from the American Heart Association highlights strategies for boosting heart health in young adults, including improving social connectedness and reducing substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier blood pressure screenings for children—even those who are healthy by other measures—could also help identify candidates for intervention before problems arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Currently, most clinical guidelines do not suggest blood pressure screenings for children who seem healthy overall,” Niu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But our evidence is clear, showing that even a small blood pressure difference in early life can magnify over a longer period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farzan, Niu and their colleagues are also studying how various combinations of environmental and social factors, such as air pollution and stress, may influence cardiometabolic health in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About this research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Farzan and Niu, the study’s other authors are Carrie V.

Three common maternal cardiometabolic risk factors during pregnancy were examined: prepregnancy obesity, gestational diabetes, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exposure&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maternal cardiometabolic risk factors were retrieved and harmonized from medical records and questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offspring systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) percentiles adjusted for age, sex, and height were calculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 12 480 mother-offspring pairs (mean [SD] maternal age during pregnancy, 29.9 [6.4] years; 856 of 12 303 identifying as Asian [7.0%]; 1908 as Black [15.5%]; 2305 as Hispanic [18.7%]; 6522 as White [52.3%], and 712 as other [5.8%] race and ethnicity), at least 1 maternal cardiometabolic risk factor was present in 5537 (44.4%), with prepregnancy obesity being the most prevalent (3072 [24.6%]), followed by HDP (1693 [13.6%]) and gestational diabetes (805 [6.5%]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offspring born to mothers with any cardiometabolic risk factors had higher SBP (4.88 percentile points; 95% CI, 3.97-5.82 percentile points) and higher DBP (1.90 percentile points; 95% CI, 1.15-2.64 percentile points) at their first blood pressure measurement, after adjusting for potential confounders, compared with their counterparts without any risk factors. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, alone or with either prepregnancy obesity or gestational diabetes, was significantly associated with higher offspring blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These associations were generally more significant among female compared with male offspring and among Black compared with other racial and ethnic groups. Among 6015 offspring who had 2 or more blood pressure measures, maternal cardiometabolic risk factors were associated with an increased rate of blood pressure change from age 2 to 18 years (SBP percentile, 0.5 [95% CI, 0.2-0.8] per year; DBP percentile, 0.7 [95% CI 0.5-1.0] per year).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that protecting pregnant individuals from cardiometabolic risk factors may promote healthier blood pressure in the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 13:46:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9GcER6V09WZFZVSW1WWjhhNzhYY0VqOFJrZEM1STZZTUd1OU1TN0VVYmV5cTgwMDhWOHlxVWVWbkY0YlZDWTluWXBqRVo2NW9kX0poYkw3Qzg3SHFva1JSZUgyOUpsZm9ZWllqR3d4TzZvNkJvU0FBalcyeUlWUQ</guid></item><item><title>使用音乐检测儿童脑震荡-神经科学新闻 | Using Music to Detect Concussion in Kids - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaEFVX3lxTFA4Y3dnS2llc3pFMnM5NG51RGZHaVVvN0NSaE9iN1oyZkV3bDVhOVNBVmV5Y3RBN2NnTi1kQUV1ckZQdFRScEFvRWF1WWdSMlNHeVpRYlpfbkx4X09qNzVSR1Z2UkFzVDlP?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new music therapy-based tool called MuSICCA may transform how healthcare teams assess consciousness in children with severe brain injuries. Developed to address the lack of reliable diagnostic methods for children aged 2 to 18, MuSICCA uses tailored live music performed by a therapist to evoke and record patient responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These responses are measured against a diagnostic scale to evaluate awareness, offering clearer insights into a child’s cognitive state. Initial feedback from professionals and families strongly supports its validity and usefulness in clinical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Musical Assessment Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; MuSICCA uses live, personalized music to help assess consciousness in children with brain injuries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Approval Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; 85% of evaluators strongly agreed it is both valid and suitable for use with children.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supports Care Teams:&lt;/strong&gt; The tool helps therapists identify patient awareness and communicate findings effectively to families and clinicians.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Anglia Ruskin University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music could provide a breakthrough in assessing consciousness levels in children who have suffered significant brain injuries, according to new research published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with disorders of consciousness rely on those caring for them to provide all aspects of their daily living, including hydration, nutrition, washing and dressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently a lack of tools to assess consciousness in children aged between two and 18 and assessing awareness in children is complicated by neurodevelopmental changes that occur as the child ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To tackle this, researchers at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), The Children’s Trust and Temple University have developed the MuSICCA (Music therapy Sensory Instrument for Cognition, Consciousness and Awareness) tool, which involves using musical stimulation to enable the patient to show how conscious they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The music is specially selected for the patient and a qualified music therapist performs this live to the patient, manipulating different aspects of the music depending on how the patient responds. The idea is to give the patient the best chance of showing what they can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The music therapist observes the child’s behaviours and records these observations against a set of scales. MuSICCA then produces a diagnosis of the level of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the study, researchers invited a group of participants including music therapists, family members of children affected by brain injuries, and healthcare professionals to evaluate MuSICCA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the study took part in question and answer sessions following a demonstration of the tool and were asked to rate how much they agreed or disagreed with two statements: On initial review, the MuSICCA appears to be an assessment of consciousness and awareness; and on initial review, the MuSICCA appears to be suitable for use with children and young people. Participants were also asked to comment on the strengths and weaknesses of the MuSICCA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All participants agreed with both statements, with 85% strongly agreeing with each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Dr Jonathan Pool, Senior Research Fellow at Anglia Ruskin University’s Cambridge Institute for Music Therapy Research, said: “Children with disorders of consciousness are often almost completely dependent on others to meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Their therapists, nurses and caregivers must interpret very subtle behaviours to help them understand their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is often great uncertainty when determining this, which makes it so important to find a reliable way of assessing levels of consciousness in these young people. Currently, there are very few ways of doing this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MuSICCA allows the music therapist to conduct a rigorous assessment of the patient’s response to various musical stimuli, giving the therapist a picture of the patient’s level of consciousness and the strengths and weaknesses of their responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The information from MuSICCA is easy to communicate to the rest of the care and medical teams and can support families in understanding what they can do to support their child’s recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study strongly suggests that MuSICCA is a suitable and comprehensive assessment method, highlighting its strengths in providing guidance, involving caregivers, and supporting clinical teams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this music and concussion research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5b313a36323e753d342928222f331b3a292e753a38752e30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jamie Forsyth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aru.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Anglia Ruskin University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Jamie Forsyth – Anglia Ruskin University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1441178" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The development and face validity of the music therapy sensory instrument for cognition, consciousness, and awareness (MuSICCA)&lt;/a&gt;” by Jonathan Pool et al. &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The development and face validity of the music therapy sensory instrument for cognition, consciousness, and awareness (MuSICCA)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severe brain injuries in children and young people can result in disorders of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can pose significant challenges for the brain injury survivor as they may struggle to show awareness; for their family, who want to help their child to recover consciousness; and for the team providing treatment and care for them, who need an assessment that will inform optimal treatment and care planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there is a paucity of fully validated behavioral tools to assess consciousness in 2–18-year-olds. Assessing awareness across this age range is challenging and complex due to neurodevelopmental changes that occur during maturation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study evaluated the face validity of a music-based behavioral assessment for children and young people with disorders of consciousness. This is known as the Music therapy Sensory Instrument for Cognition, Consciousness and Awareness (MuSICCA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study recruited 20 participants to compose a mixed cohort of music therapists, non-music therapy healthcare professionals and family members with lived experience of caring for a child or young person with a disorder of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These participants reviewed the MuSICCA and evaluated its suitability as an assessment of consciousness for use with children and young people. They provided feedback by rating their level of agreement with two statements and they also described the perceived strengths and limitations of the MuSICCA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed substantial agreement among raters that the MuSICCA appears to be an assessment of consciousness and awareness, and that the MuSICCA appears to be suitable for use with children and young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its strengths include being rigorous, comprehensive, providing guidance and opportunity for caregiver involvement, its use of salience in stimulation, and its utility in supporting the wider clinical and care teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that the MuSICCA may be a valuable assessment tool in providing treatment and care for children and young people with disorders of consciousness and their families.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 13:16:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTFA4Y3dnS2llc3pFMnM5NG51RGZHaVVvN0NSaE9iN1oyZkV3bDVhOVNBVmV5Y3RBN2NnTi1kQUV1ckZQdFRScEFvRWF1WWdSMlNHeVpRYlpfbkx4X09qNzVSR1Z2UkFzVDlP</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，血液中的咖啡因可能会影响身体脂肪和糖尿病风险- ScienceAlert | Caffeine in Your Blood Could Affect Body Fat And Diabetes Risk, Study Shows - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxPMFl4Vm5EMU9pZzU0cFRZZkRRTzF3cl9JRUVVbXIyaUw3emduQWZ6a0lmQWtRS1pRY0E4WkhaR1BVOFgtLVhocDNKUHhuSGlmX1JNUlRCWWo3YWJCajFvNDVVYnNiOURILWh6TWxxcFNCbC12dkJwTXd1MVRFWkNLWFRwMzBUaHZCNDhUbmkyM0s5OS1XMW1qTW5qUS1nbC1FRVJ5bUF3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The levels of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="103693" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; in your blood could affect the amount of body fat you carry, a factor that in turn could determine your risk of developing type 2 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="103693" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are the findings of a 2023 study that used genetic markers to establish a more definitive link between  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="160058" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; levels, BMI, and type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="160058" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team, from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, the University of Bristol in the UK, and Imperial College London in the UK, said calorie-free caffeinated drinks could be explored as a potential means of helping reduce body fat levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Genetically predicted higher plasma caffeine concentrations were associated with lower BMI and whole body fat mass," the researchers &lt;a href="https://bmjmedicine.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000335"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in their paper, published in March 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Furthermore, genetically predicted higher plasma caffeine concentrations were associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Approximately half of the effect of caffeine on type 2 diabetes liability was estimated to be mediated through BMI reduction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eqbRU-59e54?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved data from just under 10,000 people collected from existing genetic databases, focusing on variations in or near specific genes known to be associated with the speed at which caffeine is broken down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, those with variations affecting the genes – namely &lt;a href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CYP1A2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CYP1A2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a gene that regulates it, called &lt;a href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=AHR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AHR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – tend to break caffeine down more slowly, allowing it to remain in the blood longer. Yet they also tend to drink less caffeine in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An approach called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_randomization"&gt;Mendelian randomization&lt;/a&gt; was used to determine likely causal relationships between the presence of the variations, illnesses like diabetes, body mass, and lifestyle factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141100" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141100" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ThreeHandsHoldingCoffeeR_U_642.jpg" alt="Three coffees being held by hands" class="size-full wp-image-141100" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ThreeHandsHoldingCoffeeR_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ThreeHandsHoldingCoffeeR_U_642-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ThreeHandsHoldingCoffeeR_U_642-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141100" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Caffeine in your blood may help determine your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. (&lt;a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/coffee-drink-friends-latte-2565441/"&gt;StockSnap/Pixabay&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there was a significant link between caffeine levels, BMI, and type 2 diabetes risk, no relationship emerged between the amount of caffeine in the blood and cardiovascular diseases including atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have linked a moderate and relative increase in caffeine consumption to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/four-cups-of-coffee-a-day-might-be-the-perfect-amount-of-your-heart"&gt;better heart health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408398.2018.1507996"&gt;a lower BMI&lt;/a&gt;, and this research adds more detail to what we already know about the effects that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="103693" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; has on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LoTgfGotaQ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to also keep in mind the impacts of caffeine on the body &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/all-the-ways-caffeine-affects-your-body-in-one-handy-infographic"&gt;aren't all positive&lt;/a&gt;, which means &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-eye-opening-medical-case-reveals-what-can-happen-when-you-overdose-on-caffeine"&gt;care must be taken&lt;/a&gt; when weighing up the benefits of drinking it – but this latest study is an important step in assessing how much caffeine is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Small, short term trials have shown that caffeine intake results in weight and fat mass reduction, but the long term effects of caffeine intake is unknown," the researchers &lt;a href="https://bmjmedicine.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000335"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Considering the extensive intake of caffeine worldwide, even its small metabolic effects could have important health implications."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team thinks the association shown here could be down to the way caffeine increases thermogenesis (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/our-muscles-evolved-a-clever-way-to-keep-us-warm-even-when-theyre-doing-nothing"&gt;heat production&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-before-exercising-does-something-pretty-awesome-to-your-body"&gt;fat oxidation&lt;/a&gt; (turning fat into energy) in the body, which both play an important role in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-expert-reveals-3-ways-you-can-speed-up-your-metabolism"&gt;overall metabolism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_122681" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-122681" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/03/CoffeeBowelCancer-642x260.jpg" alt="Coffee in cup" class="wp-image-122681 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/03/CoffeeBowelCancer-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/03/CoffeeBowelCancer-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/03/CoffeeBowelCancer-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/03/CoffeeBowelCancer.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-122681" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The research adds to what we know about caffeine's effects. (Guido Mieth/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study involved a large sample, Mendelian randomization isn't infallible, and it's still possible that other factors are at play that weren't accounted for. More research will be needed to confirm cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Randomized controlled trials are warranted to assess whether non-caloric caffeine containing beverages might play a role in reducing the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes," &lt;a href="https://bristol.ac.uk/news/2023/march/caffeine-type2-diabetes.html"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; University of Bristol genetic epidemiologist Benjamin Woolf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9978685/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMJ Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in March 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Katherine Wells has been an epidemiologist working to protect the public from disease outbreaks for 25 years. Until January, she had never encountered measles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I mean, we considered measles eradicated in the United States," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, as public health director for Lubbock, Texas, Wells is at the center of a measles outbreak that has infected &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;more than 700 people in Texas alone&lt;/a&gt;, sent more than 90 to the hospital and killed two otherwise healthy children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The outbreak is &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/08/texas-measles-spread-oklahoma-new-mexico/" target="_blank"&gt;the largest since 2000&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infections have surpassed the number of cases that occurred during a 2019 outbreak in New York, previously the largest one, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It's frustrating," Wells said, "because we have the solution, which is a very effective vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Wells strongly believes her best chance to stop the viral infections is to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/14/1244690933/vaccine-expert-worries-child-measles-deaths-are-being-normalized" target="_blank"&gt;boost vaccination&lt;/a&gt; across West Texas, where immunization rates among kindergarteners have dropped in many counties, as they have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;nationally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of her toughest challenges: Anti-vaccine advocates have flooded the region with &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/23/nx-s1-5372760/measles-misinformation-poll" target="_blank"&gt;false claims&lt;/a&gt; about risks from vaccines. "They are moving ten times the speed we are," Wells told Tradeoffs when we caught up with her to talk about her experiences. Those false messages not only undermine the public's confidence in vaccines, she said, they sow distrust in public health more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Countering the misinformation takes money, Wells said, and the federal government — a reliable partner to local health officials in the past — has taken a step back. Wells' city and state abruptly lost federal public health funding in March when the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services cancelled more than $11 billion in grants nationwide. A spokesman for the state of Texas told Tradeoffs there aren't funds available to send to Lubbock, though the state has provided other types of support.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Wells isn't giving up. "We can't let that noise disrupt what we need to do," she said. "We still need to focus on our community. We need to get vaccines in arms, even if that takes having one-on-one conversations with individuals."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Below are highlights from our conversation with Wells, edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the shock of facing a measles outbreak &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Public health always happens at 4:30 on a Friday afternoon. That afternoon my staff told me that we had two cases, two potential cases, of measles in the hospital. And that's not unusual. You always have doctors that see a rash and they want to test for measles. So I didn't think much of it. That next Monday, I'm actually on board for one of our community nonprofits, and I was sitting in that board meeting and the woman next to me said, 'My husband is a trainer of paramedics out in the rural areas and yesterday he told me that there was a lot of measles in Gaines County.' I literally got up out of my seat, walked out and started making some phone calls.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was scary. I'm going, well, am I overreacting or is this really something? But my gut feeling inside said there's something more going on. … If you underreact, then it's so contagious, it's just like exponential growth. So you want to get in as quickly as possible and figure out exactly how many cases there are. What's going on, on the ground? Are there other sick individuals? How can we make sure it stays in that one community and doesn't spread to other communities out in the region?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the ways  federal upheaval has complicated the measles fight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;We're watching the CDC, HHS colleagues being laid off. All of this uncertainty. … I don't know what's going to be cut, what public health's going to look like at the local level.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But we have this team of people coming into work, seven days a week, helping families that are impacted with measles, combating the misinformation about vaccines, working with our providers who are needing to get children tested or adults tested, talking to businesses that might have had a measles exposure.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;That core public health work is continuing. And that's just an amazing workforce that's getting, you know, beat up in the national media, accused of their job not being important. But these people, because of their caring for the community, are continuing to show up every day, day in and day out, and making sure that the work that needs to happen during a measles outbreak happens.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On facing the 'machine' that's churning out vaccine disinformation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It is definitely a challenge. I almost call it a misinformation machine. … It's just hard to keep up with &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/23/nx-s1-5372760/measles-misinformation-poll" target="_blank"&gt;the messaging&lt;/a&gt;. You feel like you combat one bullet point on some kind of false information and then they pivot and find another. … You're watching the Children's Health Defense swoop in and start talking to the parents of the children who have died — giving false hope to a community and peddling cod liver oil and vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Being healthy — or taking these supplements — is not going to prevent your child from getting measles. And we don't know which child is going to have severe complications from measles. We don't know who's going to end up in the hospital and we don't know, unfortunately, which child may die.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On how to help people who are afraid of vaccines  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Trying to get somebody to take an injection when they're not sick, to prevent illness, just causes a lot of fear of the unknown. I've talked to a lot of parents that have said, "Well, we never had measles or polio or mumps in our community. So why, even if the risk for vaccines is so minuscule, why even take that risk if that disease doesn't exist?" We're seeing more physicians in our community willing to speak up on the importance of vaccine, more physicians willing to take the time with their patients to have those conversations.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;I think the one that really touched my heart was a mother with five young children, who had never vaccinated her children before. … She felt comfortable enough to come in and have that conversation with one of our nurses and got all five children vaccinated against measles with the MMR. … So we are getting through to individuals. It's just a slow process. She's just one of many parents that are now coming into the public health department — because we are that trusted messenger — to get the vaccine. … It's uplifting. You're so exhausted. I mean, we have worked three months straight without a day off, and it just gives you that boost of energy again— and some hope.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On cultivating community for the future of public health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It makes me want to double down on my work in public health. … Ten years from now, I hope that the narrative around vaccines is changed and we're back into a place where people can trust science and trust public health, and listen to those messages, and believe in community.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I still have some hope for all of this. There are 2,000 other health department directors out here, in the United States, who do this work day in and day out. And public health really happens on that local level – with individuals who know their community and want to make their community a better place.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan Gorenstein is executive editor and Melanie Evans is a reporter for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://tradeoffs.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tradeoffs&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a nonprofit news organization that reports on health care's toughest choices.

Those with plastic particles were 4.5 times more likely to suffer a heart attack, stroke, or death within roughly 34 months post-surgery compared to individuals whose arteries contained no plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Robert G. DeBease, a Doctor of Traditional Naturopathy and Chiropractic with 27 years of practice, is sounding the alarm and has shared practical solutions to detoxify these harmful particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Microplastics are now being found in the human heart, and the more you have, the higher your risk of a heart attack. They’re not just in your water bottles or food packaging… they’re now turning up in your brain, lungs, gut, testes—and even your blood,” Dr. DeBease, who has over 1.2 million followers on Instagram, wrote in a post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. DeBease, who has dedicated his career to holistic health, emphasizes that while microplastics are pervasive, their impact can be mitigated. He recommends four evidence-based strategies to reduce microplastic accumulation and protect long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi8wFBVV95cUxOMVBxbFRtQXkzU2V0dXhPN2R4bjFCMThocUZxZ3VyVjRiNFU4RnV0UE5kVlBxeUFJbVMzMmxYUGRBMVRRVWh2SXd3cXh0ZEhPbkNpRmd2dEVfZ2h1RWhkTnY1RXc4TC1tNU5uWkVLa0ZCdU9MY0JfUnFfdmpwMm9nN2VvVm5Kd1VKcEdUeldJeW1jR0JRdVYtcVRUOHFacElQY0dtZlBzREV2dkkwOFBiRmwtXzNFX3kzQVFHazBlNWw1QkxKcUpfRFZZdWFjUEFSN0dzN0d3Ri01YlZlOEwwR3NFVGpDdzB6aU5GaHRJNExyZ0U</guid></item><item><title>B族维生素可能阻止青光眼进展-神经科学新闻 | B Vitamins May Halt Glaucoma Progression - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZkFVX3lxTE56dmt3SV9rX0kyV2lDWXdOb3YxdjJKMks2TnhqaU5aTDQ0ZzFfeW9KaGxVVjVQSU1DdXhGVFBzRF84YVhGM2F0NjNrSW9XeUFOWDVJeThDOXJnR1VOb3hNVWJpREtBd9IBa0FVX3lxTE1zeGJQUXpNWkpNTWxDcEhBalc4cDQ1eENBVnV6YlVpQ05zQVRXR29vb0xYSVpxM1hoaVVZTG5jYUVCdDVLVTlhTjBhcmVoT3BfY3VKeVhiQWl6Y2s1c3F2MUppT1hlaE0weWZF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Glaucoma damages the optic nerve and is usually managed by reducing eye pressure, though treatment effects vary. Researchers have long suspected a link with homocysteine, but new findings reveal it is a bystander, not a driver of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, metabolic disruptions affecting the retina’s vitamin use appear key, prompting scientists to test vitamin B6, B9, B12, and choline supplements in animal models. Remarkably, this vitamin mix halted or slowed nerve damage without reducing eye pressure, and a clinical trial is now underway to test its potential in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homocysteine Role Debunked:&lt;/strong&gt; High homocysteine does not drive glaucoma but reflects metabolic changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin Therapy Promising:&lt;/strong&gt; B vitamin and choline supplements halted or slowed optic nerve damage in rodents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Trials Begun:&lt;/strong&gt; A clinical trial is now recruiting patients to test this approach in slowing glaucoma progression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Karolinska Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In glaucoma, the optic nerve is gradually damaged, leading to vision loss and, in the worst cases, blindness. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High pressure in the eye drives the disease, and eye drops, laser treatment or surgery are therefore used to lower the pressure in the eye and thus slow down the disease. Unfortunately, however, the effect varies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109682"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an eye." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In experiments on mice and rats with glaucoma, the researchers gave supplements of the B vitamins B6, B9 and B12, as well as choline. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glaucoma researchers have long theorised that the substance homocysteine is somehow relevant to understanding the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers at Karolinska Institutet have investigated the role of homocysteine in several ways. In the current study, the researchers discovered that when rats with glaucoma were given elevated levels of homocysteine, their disease did not worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that high levels of homocysteine in the blood of people with glaucoma did not correlate with how quickly the disease progressed, and that glaucoma was not more common in people with a genetic susceptibility to forming high levels of homocysteine. Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that homocysteine does not drive the disease but is a consequence of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since homocysteine is a natural part of the body’s metabolism, the researchers wanted to investigate metabolic pathways involving homocysteine in both rodents and humans with glaucoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then saw several abnormalities, the most important of which were metabolic changes linked to the retina’s ability to use certain vitamins. This change meant that metabolism was slowed down locally in the retina – and this played a role in the development of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Our conclusion is that homocysteine is a bystander in the disease process, not a player. Altered homocysteine levels may reveal that the retina has lost its ability to use certain vitamins that are necessary to maintain healthy metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why we wanted to investigate whether supplements of these vitamins could protect the retina,’ says co-lead on the paper James Tribble, researcher and assistant professor at the Department of Clinical Neuroscience at Karolinska Institutet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments on mice and rats with glaucoma, the researchers gave supplements of the B vitamins B6, B9 and B12, as well as choline. This had a positive effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice that had a slower developing glaucoma, the damage to the optic nerve was completely halted. In rats, which had a more aggressive form of the disease with faster progression, the disease was slowed down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these experiments, eye pressure was left untreated, which the researchers highlight as particularly interesting – it suggests that the vitamin mix affects the disease in a different way than lowering eye pressure does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘The results are so promising that we have started a clinical trial, with patients already being recruited at S:t Eriks Eye Hospital in Stockholm,’ says James Tribble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (slower progression) and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (faster progression) are included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about the clinical trial here.

            Getting the shingles vaccine could do more than just prevent a painful red rash — it may also lower the risk of heart disease and stroke, according to a new South Korean study of more than one million people published in the &lt;a href="https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/shingles-vaccine-lowers-the-risk-of-heart-disease-for-up-to-eight-years" target="_blank"&gt;European Heart Journal.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00023j6n1tncd0rs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/data-research/index.html#:~:text=About%201%20in%203%20people,have%20shingles%20more%20than%20once." target="_blank"&gt;highly common&lt;/a&gt; herpes strain, also called varicella-zoster virus (VZV), can cause chickenpox in childhood and later develop into shingles in older or immuno-compromised adults. The shingles vaccine is already considered a top-line defense against the virus, but &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/health/shingles-vaccine-dementia-prevention-wellness"&gt;recent studies&lt;/a&gt; have pointed to other unexpected health benefits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00033j6nwhe2j6s8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An analysis of health outcomes for 1,271,922 people age 50 and older found a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular disease among those who were vaccinated for shingles. The reduced risk was most noticeable up to eight years after vaccination among males, people under 60, and even those with “unhealthy lifestyles,” such as chronic smoking or drinking, according to the May 6 study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00043j6num94p1sl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Since shingles can cause inflammation in blood vessels and lead to blood clots, which in turn raise the risk of heart disease, preventing shingles through vaccination might also help reduce these cardiovascular risks,” explained Hayeon Lee, a coauthor and researcher from the Lee Kyung Hee University College of Medicine in an email. It’s also possible that the nerve damage caused by shingles could disturb the heart’s rhythm, leading to irregular palpitations and even cardiac arrest, per the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00053j6ne1o0v4er@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vaccine may be better at preventing shingles in younger patients and males because of their more robust immune systems, Lee said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00063j6nkbc2werc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If a vaccine helps lower the risk of both infection and serious chronic conditions, it becomes an even more valuable public health tool,” Lee said. “This study supports a broader understanding of vaccination — not just as a shield against infectious diseases, but as part of a more comprehensive approach to maintaining long-term health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00073j6n6v862hzn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More research is needed to determine a direct causal link between vaccination and reduced cardiovascular event risk, but this analysis is the largest and most comprehensive so far, presenting a compelling case for those on the fence about vaccination, said Dr. Sharon Curhan, a physician and epidemiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00083j6nws7v0690@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since this herpes strain can lie dormant in the body for years after exposure before it reactivates into shingles, you don’t need a history of chickenpox to get the vaccine, Curhan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00093j6n5svhtw3p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In fact, more than 99% of adults age 50 years and older worldwide have been exposed to VZV, and many may not have had, or known they had chickenpox at all, according to estimates from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000b3j6n62pr2p9a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Patients from the study used an older variation of the shingles vaccine that is being phased out of most countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000c3j6nspj3km9b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The live zoster vaccine, no longer available in the US &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;as of 2020&lt;/a&gt;, contains a living but weakened form of the virus used to generate an immune response. It’s since been swapped for Shingrix, a two-shot recombinant zoster vaccine containing only part of the virus — which has shown to be more effective.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000d3j6nklet201u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More research is needed to compare the various health benefits of these different vaccine variations, said Dr. Pascal Geldsetzer, an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000e3j6n0busxm50@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The biggest limitation of this type of research is that you’re essentially comparing people who get vaccinated to those who don’t get vaccinated,” Geldsetzer said. “We know that those people who decide to get vaccinated are often very different from those who don’t in their health motivations and behaviors.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000f3j6n7y3j4zx5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers were able to sort for several demographic variables such as age, sex, income level and pre-existing conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol. They also considered the frequency of medical visits and use of specific medications based on national insurance records, Lee said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000g3j6nop1mg1ig@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, some variables, like diet, other vaccinations, and proper adherence to treatments, can always slip through the cracks in non-clinical trials which use large data sets like the one used in this study, Geldsetzer said. For this reason, he hopes future studies can be randomized and use data from a clinical setting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000h3j6nptuep5ys@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, Lee said future research should observe more racially and ethnically diverse populations, as immune responses can vary across different populations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000j3j6nlcctus08@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These findings follow several other studies identifying the possible health benefits of shingles vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000k3j6nzqiuk6bk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In April, Geldsetzer and a team of researchers from Stanford published &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x" target="_blank"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; that found people who received the vaccine had a 20% reduced risk of dementia compared with those who didn’t get it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000l3j6nkmesiz7e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This study took advantage of a “natural experiment” after Wales rolled out its shingles vaccination program in 2013. Due to limited vaccine supply, government officials decided that only Welsh adults born on or after a very specific date would be eligible, so researchers could directly compare the health outcomes of two groups of individuals over time while limiting covariables.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000m3j6nnk6d2kfh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is likely because shingles doesn’t just cause inflammation in the blood vessels, said Geldsetzer. It also inflames nerves throughout the body, which can lead to long-lasting pain disorders and, in the case of dementia, brain tissue damage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Up to 30 per cent of men in the UK are said to be affected by the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies suggest it normally takes men about five-and-a-half minutes to orgasm during sex. But for about one in three, this occurs within three minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists say that both psychological and physical factors can lead to the problem, including stress, depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One 2014 study detailed the benefits of kegels for men dealing with lifelong premature ejaculation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However it is said that a regimen of tensing and relaxing the pelvic floor muscles, known as kegel exercises, has been shown to help extend the length of intimacy by two minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2014 study asked male participants to perform kegel exercises for an hour three times a week for 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, published in the journal Therapeutic Advances in Urology, Italian doctors from the Sapienza Univeristy of Rome included 40 men who had dealt with premature ejaculation for much of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the end of the study, 83 per cent of the patients had gained control of their ejaculatory reflex and were able to ‘last’ about two minutes and forty seconds longer than the average duration at the start of the study—about 39 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

could prevent around half of &lt;a href="/topic/cancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; cases from reaching an advanced stage, new research suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are currently trying to determine the effectiveness of simple blood tests in detecting cancer before symptoms appear, and whether such early detection improves survival rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/topic/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; is currently trialling such tests, including the Galleri test and miONCO-Dx test, with experts predicting a nationwide rollout of a universal cancer screening program within the next decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers writing in the journal BMJ Open say screening people annually – or every two years – could significantly boost early detection and prevent cancers from progressing to stages where treatment is less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts turned to mathematical modelling to see how a multi-cancer blood test would change what happened to a group of 50 to 79-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They used both fast-growing tumours (which remain at stage I for two to four years before progressing);

(PA Wire)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Peter Sasieni, professor of cancer epidemiology at &lt;a href="/topic/queen-mary-university-of-london"&gt;Queen Mary University of London&lt;/a&gt;, who has a lead role on the Galleri trial, told the PA news agency: “I am very excited about the science behind these tests, but we need to ensure that the technological game-changer translates to clinical benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is why we are conducting a huge randomised controlled trial to see whether the prediction made by this modelling is reasonably accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The advances in molecular biology and artificial intelligence means that we are now able to find tiny fragments of many cancers in a small blood sample. That is incredible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to show that using these tests in people without symptoms can help identify cancers earlier when they can be successfully treated, thereby preventing advanced cancer and reducing the numbers dying from cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Sasieni said he hopes that “by 2032, there should be sufficient evidence to say categorically how many lives can be saved by annual screening”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: “That could lead to national rollout being completed within the next 10 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He suggested the NHS should be able to negotiate “a much better price per test” with manufacturers for annual screening rather than every two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NHS might expect an additional 15 million blood tests per year with the technology, which is around a 2.5 per cent increase on current figures, but should not be a problem, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 lfIPRg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/02/20/9/51/iStock-113121982.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/02/20/9/51/iStock-113121982.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=85%2C134%2C0%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/02/20/9/51/iStock-113121982.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=85%2C134%2C0%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Cancer types studied included bladder, breast, cervical, bowel, kidney, liver and bile-duct, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, skin and blood cancers such as leukaemia" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-101588"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Cancer types studied included bladder, breast, cervical, bowel, kidney, liver and bile-duct, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, skin and blood cancers such as leukaemia&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr David Crosby, head of prevention and early detection research at &lt;a href="/topic/cancer-research-uk"&gt;Cancer Research UK&lt;/a&gt;, said: “Multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests are a promising area of cancer research that could help clinicians diagnose cancers earlier, potentially helping more people survive cancer and live longer, better lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is encouraging that the modelling from this research predicts that annual screening with an MCED test could reduce deaths from cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, as with any new clinical innovation, large-scale clinical trials and independent reviews are needed to fully assess the benefits and risks of using MCED tests in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With many researchers and companies active in the cancer early detection space and a range of tests available, we want to see Government and NHS support for a wide range of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That way, we can maximise the chances of finding tests that improve cancer outcomes and make a meaningful difference to patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the &lt;a href="/topic/department-of-health"&gt;Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;

The practice offers in-person visits as well as telemedicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice is accepting new oncology and hematology patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez treats cancer patients and blood cancer patients, but under hematology, also treats patients with noncancerous anemia or low platelets, which can happen as a result of interactions with medications or aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez received both his undergraduate and medical degrees from the University of Kansas. He did his residency and fellowship at the University of Kansas Medical Center. He spent an additional two years at the medical center before moving to western Kansas to work for HaysMed, where he worked for just less than 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hayspost.com/posts/a05ca048-415e-412f-bcea-55ff325a76b9"&gt;Rodriguez was one of two former HaysMed doctors who sued the hospital, arguing the noncompete clauses in their contracts, which would have kept them from practicing within a 110-mile radius of Hays, were too restrictive.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hayspost.com/posts/057d44cb-ad96-4aab-951d-a71a18cbee0a"&gt; The doctors and hospital came to a resolution through meditation, but the terms of that agreement were kept confidential.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="py-8"&gt;&lt;img class="mx-auto w-full sm:w-full md:w-full" src="https://media.eaglewebservices.com/public/2025/5/1746731753831.jpeg" alt="Amanda Volchko, PA"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="text-center italic text-gray-700 text-sm pt-2"&gt;Amanda Volchko, PA&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volchko was born and raised in New Jersey. She trained in Philadelphia before a recruiter hired her to work in Hoxie. Rodriguez met Volchko while working in Hays, and she expressed an interest in working with cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My No. 1 directive at this point is to bring treatment locally," Rodriguez said. "In my time at my previous employment, everyone had to come to our location, come to Hays, come to the University of Kansas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're trying to keep people as close to home as possible. Our primary directive is to get as much of that care done locally as possible, including cancer evaluation, chemotherapy administration, and diagnostic imaging and labs. "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez said getting treatment close to home makes a "huge" difference for cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you can imagine any time someone has to get systemic treatment for a malignancy, it's not the best day of their life," he said. "Even when you do it 100% correctly, it still takes a toll on the person."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bringing care closer to patients means they don't have to drive hours for care. That is physically better for the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It helps emotionally," Rodriguez said, "and it really does help financially. Sometimes funds are limited. These treatments are expensive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients rarely come for treatment alone. Rodriguez said local treatment results in less stress for the family members and friends who are assisting the patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that we come to them is greatly beneficial and so appreciated by everyone I have worked with in these first few weeks," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because there are no cures for the diseases that Rodriguez treats, an oncologist aims to extend life and enhance quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the end, we're trying to buy people more time to live their life, to be with friends, family, and experience things they love," Rodriguez said. "The less time you spend with me, the better. The less time you have to spend traveling, even better than that. We're trying to have our cake and eat it too, where they still get the excellent care they would receive somewhere like the University of Kansas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also wanted patients to know he will be their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whether Amanda [Volchko] sees you or not, I am the one making those final plans. I will be making those plans even if I'm on vacation or if it's in the middle of the night, I will be your person," Rodriguez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he will also work with other physicians as needed, adding that through his experience, he's made many connections with other doctors across the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez, who is a Goodland native, said he and his wife, who is a Larned native, wanted to stay in western Kansas and give back to rural communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My desire had always been to go back and help the people that helped me," he said. "I didn't get to this place alone. I had excellent teachers and a community that shaped me into the person I am today. I have a sincere desire to help them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice's appointments are filling fast. The Oakley clinic is full through July. Rodriguez said he wanted to thank the community for supporting the practice thus far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm really excited to get this project going," Rodriguez said. "It's been a dream of mine since graduating from medical school. It's finally happening, and the support that I have received from the community has been nothing but spectacular.

This applies to adults, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, the elderly, and children aged 11 to 17. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Ahmed, most people only need around 10 micrograms, which is equivalent to 400 units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Vitamin D helps regulate the amount of calcium and phosphate in the body - keeping bones, teeth and muscles healthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Whilst Dr Ahmed agreed that the optimum range is likely higher than the ones usually stated, he said taking too much vitamin D can be really dangerous, especially if you don't get your blood checked regularly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Dr Ahmed agreed with NHS guidelines that recommend a supplement dose of no more than 100 micrograms units a day, he said some people do need a much higher dose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These are patients who have very low vitamin D on their blood tests', he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, the minimum threshold of vitamin D, set out by the institute of medicine, is 20ng/ml. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the UK's threshold for deficiency is much lower, at 12ng/ml, a level that has long been criticised by international health experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The amount you need as a supplement depends on your symptoms, your ethnicity, your skin colour, but also your blood test result', Dr Ahmed cautioned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is why the doctor, who has over 95,500 followers on Instagram, urged anyone who takes vitamin D supplements to get a blood test to see if they are taking too much of the so-called sunshine vitamin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I urge most people taking vitamin D supplements to get their levels checked regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You have to take it carefully and responsibly and not take too much of a high dose.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ahmed is not the first medic to warn against megadoses of vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;NHS surgeon Doctor Karan Rajan previously suggested looking for vitamin D supplements that contain vitamin K2, which helps reduce the risk of calcium being deposited in the blood stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While supplements can help to boost vitamin D levels, experts say adequate sunlight exposure and a healthy diet that includes things like oily fish, red meat and fortified foods, are the best sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 09:36:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>从疫情防范到珍贵的冷冻唾沫， NIH合同终止深度切入- statnews.com | From pandemic preparedness to precious frozen spit, NIH contract terminations cut deep - statnews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPUXhrOWM1aUx0WHIxUFZ4bEdxNDFNU1V0V3k0bG51V2tQZ0w0c0V1cm9QbGt0dC1IdWpvNy1FcWJ5dXhtZ3JlVVNOSjM5M3VKTVBOQkZ6aXgyMXlhZjloMWcxSjQ1RGRVdVdod0ZubDZkVjE5b2c1S3NsTzVMTk5ZYzdpU3Nmc1Z6d1JEckdR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jay Tischfield prides himself on his long track record of cellular custodianship. As the founding director of the Human Genetics Institute of New Jersey at Rutgers University, he maintains one of the largest university-based DNA banks in the world — much of it, on behalf of the U.S. government. Starting about three decades ago, the National Institutes of Health began outsourcing the storage and distribution of samples from several nationwide studies to Tischfield and his network of finely tuned freezers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the millions of samples he oversees are about 23,000 tubes of frozen spit collected from Americans suffering from psychiatric and substance use disorders over 15 months in the early 2010s. Back then, Tischfield’s team extracted the DNA from cells floating in those saliva samples and began to decode it. Scientists have since used that information to track alcohol and drug consumption trends in the U.S. and find genetic connections between substance use and mental health conditions like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The DNA data from the project, called NESARC-III, are housed online in an NIH repository available to researchers all over the world. But the physical specimens — the raw material backups — exist in only one place: at Rutgers with Tischfield. They were supposed to stay there, for a few more years, at least. But as deep cuts to the NIH’s contracting budget start to take effect, the future of this valuable resource is now in doubt. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Late last week, Tischfield received an email from the NIH informing him that his five-year, $676,000 contract for storing the NESARC-III samples was being terminated early. He has not yet received any instructions on what to do with all that precious frozen spit.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“At this time, I have no idea as to the disposition of these valuable samples or whether an appeal is allowed,” he told STAT in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An outbreak of measles—a disease once declared eliminated in the U.S.—has hospitalized &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;91 people&lt;/a&gt; in Texas, killing two unvaccinated school-aged children. It is a horrific disease: In severe cases, a child’s immune system collapses, and they suffer seizures and brain damage from encephalitis or drown as fluid fills their lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And any outbreak of measles is entirely preventable. The first vaccine was introduced 62 years ago, and vaccination saved an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles"&gt;60 million lives&lt;/a&gt; between 2000 and 2023 alone. Measles epidemics once represented a public health crisis, but today the disease represents a different kind of affliction—one that is both psychological and cultural in nature, and one that is surprisingly resistant to intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a recent episode of the &lt;em&gt;Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt;, British author Douglas Murray challenged the world’s most popular podcaster over his penchant for hosting “armchair experts” who promote ideas outside of the mainstream. Specifically, Murray cited Rogan’s interviews with Daryl Cooper, a podcaster who has argued that Winston Churchill was the “real villain” of World War II, and comedian Dave Smith, who appeared on the podcast with Murray, and whose taste for criticizing Israel has never inspired him to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DISEKHxtgl1/"&gt;pay a visit&lt;/a&gt;. Murray faced significant backlash from right-wing influencers on social media, while writers at &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;UnHerd&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Quillette&lt;/em&gt; rallied behind him. Yet despite the lengthy conversation, which spanned hours, some crucial concepts were left unaddressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;        


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main issue that Murray did not raise was that in the ecosystem that Rogan occupies, many podcasters and their listeners &lt;em&gt;do not read&lt;/em&gt;. Murray brought his norms of journalistic rigor into a largely postliterate culture, where information is consumed via aural and visual formats as opposed to the written word. It was a clash of cultures between an author and journalist who primarily lives in the world of printed text, and those who primarily live in the world of conversation and storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


    &lt;div class="custom-image-block"&gt;
        &lt;figure class="content-large mb-6 w-full"&gt;
            &lt;img src="https://thedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rogan.png?w=2048&amp;amp;h=0&amp;amp;crop=1" class="w-full" alt="Illustration by The Dispatch.

(Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
                    &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This postliterate shift isn’t merely occurring in digital media ecosystems—it has penetrated some of the world’s most prestigious educational institutions. &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/11/the-elite-college-students-who-cant-read-books/679945/"&gt;In an article for &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year, Rose Horowitch described students at elite universities who struggle to read an entire book. One first-year student confessed she had never been assigned a complete book throughout high school—only excerpts and articles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to distinguish the difference between a literate and postliterate world. For centuries, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/0198229976?ref_=mr_referred_us_au_au"&gt;women died in childbirth&lt;/a&gt; at relatively steady rates. Only when doctors started sharing knowledge about obstetric techniques in medical journals did mortality rates start to decline. Sharing knowledge via the written word enhances the accuracy of the transmitted information, whereas oral reinterpretations lend themselves to inefficiency and error. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an audio-visual narrative culture—which lacks the precision and permanence of written documentation—combines with amateur methods, our collective ability to discern the truth simply deteriorates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with armchair experts like Daryl Cooper and Dave Smith isn’t what they claim but how they reach those claims. Their conclusions may occasionally align with reality, but they arrive there without the rigor that ensures reliability. When someone forms theories about Churchill or Israel without consulting primary sources or visiting the region, they’re charting territory blindly. Criticism, therefore, should focus on process instead of results: Their flawed methods inevitably produce unreliable findings, even when they occasionally stumble onto correct conclusions by chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to working out what is true in the world, there is a hierarchy of method. If I fear I have cancer in my body, I am perfectly free to visit a psychic if I choose to—but her technique for discovering a malignant growth is going to be less effective than an oncologist’s. This doesn’t mean that the oncologist is always right, or that the psychic is always wrong. What it means is that the tools used by the oncologist—blood tests and radiology—are simply better than sensing, reading tea leaves, or consulting the stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other empirical professions have a hierarchy of methods, too. History scholars examine secondary sources (written accounts of the time period), but also primary sources (manuscripts and contemporaneous eyewitness accounts) of the era they wish to understand. Just as someone who is unable to replace the carburetor of his car cannot call himself a mechanic, anyone who does not consult primary sources in their research cannot call themselves a historian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote class="content-large pull-quote default-py small-my pl-0 border-l-0 border-y border-black/30 border-dashed custom-block"&gt;
    &lt;h2 class="h2 text-black text-center"&gt;
                    “Rigor dampens engagement, and uncertainty saps attention. The marketplace of ideas has been subsumed by a marketplace of emotions, where incentives reward those with the sloppiest procedures.”            &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journalism also has a method. While not all journalism is alike (this opinion column is not the same as an investigative piece), one expects journalists reporting on a conflict or protest or natural disaster to do so from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These empirical professions each employ graduated standards of evidence. Gut intuition, vibes, tea leaves, psychic readings, tarot cards, revelations, and superstition fall below the threshold of acceptable evidence. Just above this threshold sit anecdotes and case studies: “My auntie said she saw a UFO last night.” One level higher are cohort studies, synthesis of secondary sources, and analysis of contemporaneous reports. At the top sit randomized controlled trials, original research using primary sources, and on-the-ground investigative reporting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the mid-20th century, many elite institutions have rejected the philosophical orientation of empiricism in favor of a faddish postmodern view of the world. Postmodernism, alongside romanticist and fundamentalist religious modes of thought, rejects the notion that humans are able to discern what is true through data collection and experimentation. Romanticists believe that the &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/gfile/donald-trump-rousseau-nietzsche-nationalism/"&gt;truth is discerned through feeling&lt;/a&gt;, fundamentalists through revelation—and postmodernists believe that there is no such thing as truth at all. Our new media ecosystem blends all three of these outlooks, rendering empiricism a quaint relic of another age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tucker Carlson speaks of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/tucker-carlson-demon-attack"&gt;being attacked by demons&lt;/a&gt; in his sleep, Candace Owens dismisses the &lt;a href="https://x.com/RobotPolisher/status/1913002527815069909"&gt;moon landing&lt;/a&gt; as “fake and gay,” and Russell Brand sells amulets to his followers to ward off “evil energies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;During and after the pandemic, Bret Weinstein—an evolutionary biologist who was once hounded out of Evergreen State College, and who is now a professional podcaster—claimed mRNA vaccines were “&lt;a href="https://medium.com/rebel-wisdom/on-vaccine-safety-ivermectin-and-the-dark-horse-podcast-an-investigation-f32491d4c970"&gt;unsafe for women&lt;/a&gt;,” &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240108035213/https://tuckercarlson.com/the-tucker-carlson-encounter-bret-weinstein/"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; to Tucker Carlson that “17 million people” had died from COVID vaccines, and pronounced this imaginary death toll “a great tragedy of history.” But every step Weinstein took away from rigor increased his audience and influence. Peer-reviewed research is slow and time-consuming. Sharing lurid stories of vaccine injuries is easy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Bret Weinstein’s conspiracy theories &lt;a href="https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/bret-weinstein-sure-has-a-lot-of"&gt;span multiple domains&lt;/a&gt;. Documented by Chris Kavanagh, of the &lt;a href="https://decoding-the-gurus.captivate.fm/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decoding the Gurus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; podcast, and &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.com/author/jesse-singal/"&gt;Jesse Singal&lt;/a&gt;, independent journalist and &lt;em&gt;Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; contributor, Weinstein has suggested that Israel’s unpreparedness for the October 7 attack was deliberately orchestrated by powerful interests to create division among COVID skeptics; China’s one-child policy was strategically designed to create an army of males to infiltrate the U.S. military; and that his own groundbreaking telomere research was stolen by one of his peers—who went on to win a Nobel Prize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The continuous positive feedback from a growing audience doesn’t just reward methodological shortcuts—it demands them. There is no clearer demonstration of how audience capture drives counter-Enlightenment thinking in digital media than Weinstein’s trajectory. Rigor dampens engagement, and uncertainty saps attention. The marketplace of ideas has been subsumed by a marketplace of emotions, where incentives reward those with the sloppiest procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his 2022 book,&lt;em&gt; Liberalism and Its Discontents&lt;/em&gt;, Francis Fukuyama writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attack on modern natural science and Enlightenment approaches to cognition began on the left, as critical theory exposed the hidden agendas of the elites who promoted them. This approach denied the possibility of true objectivity, and valued instead subjective feelings and emotions as a source of authenticity. Skepticism has now drifted over to the populist right, who see elites using these same scientific cognitive modes not as techniques to marginalize minority communities, but rather to victimize the former mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Fukuyama described is an ideological inversion: The left’s tools of deconstruction are now used by the right. Pandora’s box has been opened, and epistemic nihilism cannot be selectively applied. In 2017, a Canadian political scientist, Matt McManus, &lt;a href="https://quillette.com/2018/05/17/emergence-rise-postmodern-conservatism/"&gt;wrote for &lt;em&gt;Quillette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt; “postmodern conservatives are not substantially different from their leftwing opponents. Both regard identity as the locus of epistemic and moral validity, and both are preoccupied with achieving power since that is their only major concern.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tend to take our modern world for granted—running water, piped-in gas, an electricity grid, internet, superabundant consumer goods, medicines, and life-saving surgeries performed under anesthesia. Citizens in a modern liberal society are like fish in water: They don’t comprehend the luxuriousness of their lifestyles and could not survive without them. We are surrounded by the fruits of liberal capitalism to the point where critics of this system rely on the very tools created by it to condemn it. Yet success has bred complacency, and in the third decade of the 21st century, this complacency is now coming home to roost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;h2 class="h2 text-black text-center"&gt;
                    “Sharing knowledge via the written word enhances the accuracy of the transmitted information, whereas oral reinterpretations lend themselves to inefficiency and error.”             &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States, a country founded on Enlightenment ideals, is at a crossroads: Trade policy is conducted according to vibes, anti-vaccine propaganda is spread by the highest health official of the land, and children now die of a once-eliminated disease.A path forward requires a counter-counter-Enlightenment. This doesn’t require censorship or an appeal to authority, but a return to rigor and the written word. While podcasts and videos are undoubtedly entertaining, their ability to transmit knowledge is time-consuming and inefficient. They are the equivalent of the fireside yarn—what humans did before we emerged from our caves. Text may not be as popular as a three-hour podcast conversation, but it remains the form of knowledge most likely to be accessed by future generations. &lt;em&gt;Principia Mathematica&lt;/em&gt; was not a podcast, and &lt;em&gt;On the Origins of Species&lt;/em&gt; was not a video series. Technologies may continue to create disruption, but we won’t enter a new Dark Age unless we forget the ability to read and write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Psychedelics like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lsd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73096" data-postid="160828" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;LSD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6007659/"&gt;and psilocybin&lt;/a&gt; (the active ingredient in magic mushrooms) are gaining &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/mind-molding-psychedelic-drugs-could-treat-depression-and-other-mental-illnesses-98071"&gt;increasing attention in psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/article/27/12/pyae057/7912598"&gt;Studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; they may offer therapeutic benefits for conditions such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="160828" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, anxiety, obsessive–compulsive disorder, eating disorders and addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/jan/psychedelic-drug-being-tested-treatment-heavy-drinking"&gt;Our research team&lt;/a&gt; is investigating whether &lt;a href="https://adf.org.au/drug-facts/dmt/"&gt;N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT)&lt;/a&gt;, a fast-acting psychedelic, can help people reduce alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol is the most commonly &lt;a href="https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7626/CBP-7626.pdf"&gt;misused substance in the UK&lt;/a&gt;, partly because it is legal, widely available and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4872611/"&gt;deeply ingrained in social culture&lt;/a&gt;. While many people can enjoy alcohol &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3536464/"&gt;in moderation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/127/public-accounts-committee/news/195391/government-not-taking-appalling-harms-from-alcohol-seriously-enough/"&gt;a significant number&lt;/a&gt; struggle to control their drinking. For these people, &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/alcohol-misuse/"&gt;excessive alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt; can lead to serious physical, mental and social consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional treatments don't work for everyone, which is why we're exploring alternatives, such as psychedelics, that might enable people to change their behaviour in a single, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/psychedelic-drugs-can-be-almost-as-life-altering-as-near-death-experiences-189325"&gt;transformative experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DMT is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10122081/"&gt;metabolised rapidly&lt;/a&gt; in the body. When &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10206108/"&gt;administered intravenously&lt;/a&gt;, the effects kick in almost immediately, typically within one to two minutes. However, these effects are short-lived, lasting only ten to 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its brief duration, many users describe the experience as intensely profound. They often report vivid visions, complex patterns and a sensation of entering a different reality. In some cases, the experience leads to a complete shift in how they think, feel and perceive the world. For many, the experience is deeply meaningful and transformative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens in the brain during this time, and how might it influence long-term behaviour, such as reducing alcohol consumption?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neuroplasticity and addiction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychedelicunit.com/"&gt;Our team&lt;/a&gt; is particularly interested in how psychedelics like DMT might help in the context of addiction. One theory is that psychedelics can &lt;a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/42/45/8439"&gt;temporarily enhance neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt;, the brain's ability to form new neural connections. This temporary boost could open a window of flexibility, allowing some people to be more open to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For someone stuck in the cycle of heavy drinking, this enhanced plasticity might help them break old habits and develop healthier behaviour. Essentially, it could offer the brain &lt;a href="https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/POST-PB-0064/POST-PB-0064.pdf"&gt;an opportunity to "rewire"&lt;/a&gt; itself and disrupt the unhealthy patterns that underlie addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yS9FBB19Ws0?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're also focusing on the brain's reward and motivation systems, which &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK424849/#:%7E:text=The%20%E2%80%9Creward%20circuitry%E2%80%9D%20of%20the,%2C%20substance%20seeking%2C%20and%20use."&gt;play a key role&lt;/a&gt; in addiction. These systems influence behaviour associated with pleasure, including eating, sex and drinking alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In people with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633413/"&gt;alcohol use disorder&lt;/a&gt;, these systems become hypersensitive to alcohol-related cues, often at the expense of other rewarding experiences. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11978192/"&gt;Some early research&lt;/a&gt; suggests psychedelics may help "reset" these reward pathways. We're testing this theory to see whether DMT can reduce alcohol consumption by recalibrating the brain's reward system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore these possibilities, we've designed a study with heavy drinkers who are motivated to reduce their alcohol intake. Every participant undergoes a thorough screening to ensure they're fit for the study and all sessions are conducted in a highly controlled, clinical setting with medical professionals and experienced researchers overseeing the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involves three visits to our lab at UCL. On the first and third visits, we use &lt;a href="https://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info/fmribrain"&gt;functional magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; (fMRI) to measure brain activity and observe how different regions of the brain interact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the scans, participants watch emotionally engaging films, which offer a more natural way to study brain responses compared to abstract tasks. This helps us assess how DMT might impact brain function in real-life, emotionally charged situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the second visit, participants are randomly assigned to receive either DMT, a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="160828" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;, or a non-psychedelic drug (&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/article/19/4/pyv102/2910039"&gt;D-cycloserine&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/lisuride"&gt;Lisuride&lt;/a&gt;). These non-psychedelic substances are believed to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763425001320"&gt;promote neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt; without inducing the full psychedelic effects of DMT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK546641/"&gt;study is double-blind&lt;/a&gt; – neither the participants nor the researchers know which substance is being administered. This helps eliminate bias and ensures that the results are as reliable as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we measure changes in brain activity during the drug infusion using &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/electroencephalogram/"&gt;electroencephalography (EEG)&lt;/a&gt;. EEG tracks the brain's electrical signals and could help us predict which participants are most likely to benefit from DMT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants also complete a range of psychological assessments, including questionnaires and tasks that measure memory, attention, mood and decision-making. This data will help us understand how changes in brain function might relate to changes in drinking behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we're hoping to discover&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're still in the process of collecting data, but we're excited to see whether DMT can lead to meaningful reductions in alcohol consumption. As researchers, it's crucial that we stay objective and allow the evidence to guide our conclusions. By keeping the study "blinded" until all results are in, we ensure that our findings are unbiased and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If DMT proves effective in helping people reduce their alcohol consumption, particularly for those who have struggled with other treatments, it could pave the way for a new approach to addiction therapy. Even if the results are inconclusive, they will still provide valuable insights into the potential role of psychedelics in addiction treatment and open up new avenues for future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pKR-jvGlkNg?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to emphasise that this research is taking place in a safe, controlled environment. Psychedelics are potent substances, and their effects can be unpredictable, especially outside of clinical settings. They are not a "magic bullet" and are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/psychedelics-could-make-mental-health-worse-in-people-with-a-personality-disorder-226099"&gt;not suitable for everyone&lt;/a&gt;. The controlled setting allows us to study their effects while minimising risk to participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, we believe psychedelics &lt;a href="https://www.psychedelicunit.com/unity-alcohol"&gt;offer a unique opportunity&lt;/a&gt; to better understand the brain and its capacity for change. By examining how transformative experiences can influence behaviour, we hope to contribute to the development of more effective treatments for addiction and other mental health conditions.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255454/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find push-ups hard, and, if I’m honest, I can’t do more than three push-ups in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Simarro, a personal trainer focused on women’s health and building body confidence through strength training, can easily do more than three push-ups at a time. But, she tells me, she still doesn’t find push-ups easy and that’s for a very important reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I still find push-ups as hard today as I did when I started because you end up doing more reps or you're making it more challenging,” says Simarro. “But unless you’re making it more challenging, your body’s not adapting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is the one thing that women need to understand with strength training—we cannot stand still with it.

Push-up &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simarro agrees with me that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/push-up" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/push-up"&gt;push-ups&lt;/a&gt; are hard work, whatever your ability, but tells me they make her list of favorites because they are so effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re one of the hardest to get right, but push-ups are a fantastic bodyweight exercise and there are loads of ways to regress it if you need to start somewhere easier,” says Simarro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-awfFACSHhc5DFSmYavExEP" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-awfFACSHhc5DFSmYavExEP slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you want to build up to your &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/use-this-expert-trainer-s-foolproof-four-step-plan-to-get-your-first-push-up" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/use-this-expert-trainer-s-foolproof-four-step-plan-to-get-your-first-push-up"&gt;first push-up&lt;/a&gt;, Simarro suggests starting with standing &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/i-tried-doing-wall-push-ups-every-day-for-a-monthheres-what-happened" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/i-tried-doing-wall-push-ups-every-day-for-a-monthheres-what-happened"&gt;wall push-ups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you become comfortable with this &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/modified-push-ups" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/modified-push-ups"&gt;modified push-up&lt;/a&gt;, progress to incline push-ups, placing your hands on a sturdy platform, such as a chair, bench or table. Increase the difficulty by lowering the height of the platform you’re using, until you get to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A final step is to practice eccentric push-ups, where you just lower yourself to the floor slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-dead-bug"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Dead bug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reason I like a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/dead-bug" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/dead-bug"&gt;dead bug&lt;/a&gt; is you can progress them,” says Simarro. “They are suitable for everyone and I think they’re a fantastic place for nearly every woman to start training their core.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just don’t make the mistake of thinking a strong core means a visible six-pack. “A strong core means stability and functionality,” says Simarro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dead bugs work the deep core muscles and you can use your bodyweight to begin with, before progressing to weighted dead bugs when you are ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-squat"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are a lot of misconceptions about weight loss—especially online.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians agree that myths like carbs make you gain weight and you need to track calories and macros can cause more harm than good. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instead, tips like prioritizng a balanced diet and exercise you enjoy can help support healthy, sustainable weight loss in the long term. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In an endless stream of health and wellness content, it can be easy to fall for the promise of quick fixes. From restrictive diets that guarantee rapid weight loss to “fat-burning” supplements backed by influencers, these trends gain viral popularity despite little scientific evidence to back them. Far from harmless, some of these misconceptions may negatively impact your health. We spoke with registered dietitians to debunk the most common myths about weight loss and what you should know instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-myth-1-carbs-make-you-gain-weight"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Myth #1: Carbs Make You Gain Weight &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many diets encourage eliminating carbohydrates, claiming that skipping carbs will help you lose weight fast. But registered dietitians know better. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Carbohydrates are your body’s main source of fuel, particularly your brain. Plus, complex carbs are full of important nutrients like fiber, something many of us already don’t get enough of,” says &lt;a href="https://www.therethinkteam.com/devyn-goodman" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Devyn Goodman, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend consuming 45 to 65% of daily energy intake from carbohydrates, which gives you enough energy to live your best life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Cutting out carbs might lead to short-term changes, but it often triggers cravings, low energy and feeling out of control around food,” explains &lt;a href="https://revvhealth.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Marissa Beck, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research suggests that low-carb diets may reduce body fat in the short term, for up to 6 months, but their benefits diminish over time.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Eliminating carbs may also cause nutritional imbalances–if you’re not eating carbs, you’ll have to replace them with more fat and protein. Eating too much fat and protein from high-fat animal products may increase your risk of developing high cholesterol and insulin resistance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of eliminating carbs, eat balanced meals and snacks that include protein, carbs and fats. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-myth-2-the-faster-you-lose-weight-the-better"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Myth #2: The Faster You Lose Weight, the Better &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We live in a world of instant gratification, so it makes sense that you may want immediate weight loss results and will often go to great lengths to get them. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Rapid weight loss often means losing water and muscle mass, not just fat. It can also slow your metabolism, making it harder to maintain that new weight long-term,” Beck explains. “Many people regain the weight they lost—and sometimes more—because their body is trying to recover from what it perceives as a threat.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The National Institutes of Health (NIH) emphasizes gradual, sustainable behavior changes for effective weight loss, long-term health and prevention of weight cycling, which has been associated with increased risks of heart disease, insulin resistance and other metabolic issues.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To counter these risks, Beck says she focuses on sustainable habits that help people feel better about their bodies, regardless of what the scale says. While sustainable eating behavior changes might not make the weight come off quickly, “you will retain muscle and support a healthier metabolism, better energy levels and long-term weight stability (if your body is meant to change at all),” Beck tells &lt;em&gt;EatingWell.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may think you need to log your food and track your calories or macros (short for the macronutrients: carbohydrates, protein and fat) to lose weight, but this couldn’t be further from the truth. “While food tracking can bring short-term awareness to what you’re eating, it often disconnects people from their natural hunger and fullness cues,” says Beck. “We aren’t meant to eat by numbers forever. Obsessively counting calories or macros can increase anxiety around food and lead to burnout. Success comes from building flexible habits and learning to trust your body again, not from micromanaging what you eat,” she adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Calorie tracking often accompanies cookie-cutter calorie targets that are too low, which can also interfere with your health and weight loss goals. “Your body burns energy differently depending on your metabolism, the food you eat and the amount of physical activity you do. You could eat the same calories as someone else and have completely different outcomes,” says Goodman. A 2020 study found that intuitive eating, which focuses on internal hunger and fullness cues, reduces food-related anxiety and disordered eating compared to rigid tracking, promoting a healthier relationship with food.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of tracking, Goodman recommends being mindful of portion sizes and aiming for balance and variety. “This is more attainable and sustainable for most people,” she explains. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether it’s carbs, fat, dairy or gluten, if a diet promises weight loss by eliminating whole food groups, that’s your cue to run for the hills. “Cutting out foods is one of the quickest ways people get stuck in a cycle of restriction and rebound eating,” says Beck. “Your body is designed to protect you from starvation, and in the long term, this approach might damage your relationship with food and make sustainable weight changes much more challenging to achieve,” she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not only can this practice negatively affect your relationship with food, but it can also cause you to miss out on essential nutrients. “All food groups have a purpose and can align with any health goal,” says &lt;a href="https://dineoncampus.com/cmichdining/meet-your-dietitian" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Brianna Archangeli, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “I tell my clients that balance means eating what you want and adding what you need,” she adds. For example, if you’re craving chocolate, eat a small handful of dark chocolate-covered almonds paired with a sliced apple. The chocolate satisfies the sweet tooth, almonds provide protein and healthy fats, and the apple adds fiber and vitamins.Or maybe you’re in the mood for pasta, but you know your body needs protein and veggies, too. Look no further than our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/267768/chicken-spinach-skillet-pasta-with-lemon-parmesan/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Chicken &amp;amp; Spinach Skillet Pasta with Lemon &amp;amp; Parmesan&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s easy to fixate on the number on the scale as the ultimate measure of health, especially when weight loss is a goal, but this narrow focus can be misleading. “The scale doesn’t show some of the less-noticeable changes that are happening below the surface—those that are not seen outwardly at first,” explains Archangeli. The scale can go in either direction depending on many factors such as fluid shifting, phase of menstrual cycle, changes in muscle mass and bowel movements. These fluctuations can create a false sense of failure, overshadowing meaningful health improvements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “A better goal is to focus on non-scale victories, like feeling stronger or lowering blood pressure,” Achangeli recommends. Maybe you’re sleeping better, perhaps you have more energy, or maybe you’re able to walk longer distances without feeling winded. These non-scale victories are important indicators of health and certainly worth celebrating. “Giving attention to these non-weight-related achievements helps you stay motivated and gives you appreciation for the effort you have put in to enrich your wellbeing,” she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beck encourages her clients to focus on what helps them feel better, not just what changes the scale. “When you build consistent, supportive habits, your weight will settle where it’s meant to without extreme measures,” says Beck. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Processed and convenience foods often get a bad rap, but not all processed foods are created equal. While some ultra-processed foods are higher in added sugars, fat and calories, making them easy to overeat and potentially challenging for weight management goals, other minimally processed foods are nutrient-dense and time-saving options. For instance, canned beans are a great way to increase fiber and protein intake, both of which increase satiety (feelings of fullness) and aid in weight loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research shows you can carefully construct a nutritious meal plan from processed foods, such as whole-grain breads, beans, canned fish and others.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Some of my favorites include frozen fruits and vegetables, canned beans, canned tuna and chicken, precooked rice or lentils and whole grain fortified cereals and crackers,” Archangeli tells &lt;em&gt;EatingWell.&lt;/em&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even ultra-processed foods with more saturated fats and added sugar can occasionally be enjoyed. “All of your favorite foods should be included in your diet in moderation along with other whole, nutrient-dense foods,” says Goodman. “When you cut out your favorite foods, you often feel deprived, making it harder to consume them in moderation.”

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat consistent meals and snacks throughout the day. &lt;/strong&gt;“Going too long without eating can lead to energy crashes and overeating later,” says Beck. Regular eating schedules help regulate appetite, mood and metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize sleep and manage stress. &lt;/strong&gt;Poor sleep and chronic stress disrupt hormones that control hunger and fat storage.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Sometimes improving sleep and stress does more for your health than any diet ever could,” Beck says. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move your body in ways that feel good. &lt;/strong&gt;Consistent, enjoyable movement supports heart health, energy and mood.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Ironically, this is more sustainable when tied to feeling better than earning or burning food.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat protein- and fiber-rich meals you enjoy.&lt;/strong&gt; Meals packed with fiber and protein are more satiating, keeping you full and satisfied for longer. Plus, research shows that a non-restrictive diet high in fiber and protein may promote weight loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are ways to approach weight changes without falling into the all-or-nothing mindset that diet culture promotes. “The way I see it is, instead of forcing your body into a certain size, support it with consistent behaviors, a healthier mindset and genuine self-care,” Beck suggests. To promote a healthy weight and overall health, eat consistently throughout the day, incorporate fiber and protein, find movement you enjoy and make it a habit, prioritize sleep and manage stress.

"Chia seeds are rich in a type of omega-3 fatty acid known as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). The body cannot produce ALA its own, so it must be obtained through food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consuming ALA has been linked to a decreased heart disease risk," a Harvard report says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe chia seeds can boost brainpower?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chia-rich nutrition has positive effects on cognitive abilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scholars.direct/Articles/neurodegenerative-disorders/jnd-2-007.pdf?jid=neurodegenerative-disorders" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;found that chia seed based diet has a positive impact on the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/cognitive-health" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;cognitive health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;in humans. This was proven in particular not only by the two tests with high significance but also by the memory task, which indicates that a dietary intake of Salvia hispanica L can positively impact memory abilities. The study published in the Journal of Neurodegenerative Disorders explored to what extent the intake of chia seeds may have favourable effects on schoolchildren, students or Alzheimer’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With all appropriate scientific caution, it appears to be evident thus far that in an aging society, dealing with the increase of cognitive diseases such as Alzheimer’s or dementia, the daily consumption of Salvia hispanica L is highly recommendable," the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to use chia seeds as a &lt;keyword id="26753907" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="brain-superfood" source="keywords"&gt;brain superfood&lt;/keyword&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always soak them first.

Soaked chia is easier to digest, which means your body can better absorb all those brain-friendly nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mix 2 tablespoons of chia seeds with half a cup of water or almond milk.

&lt;p&gt;Travelers headed to Fiji this summer better pack more than just their swimsuits — they might want to add some serious bug spray. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) just issued a warning for the tropical hotspot as &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/10/us-news/dozens-of-nj-residents-sickened-with-dengue-fever/"&gt;dengue fever cases spike&lt;/a&gt; across the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dengue, a potentially deadly virus spread by mosquitoes, has Fiji’s government &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/25/world-news/suspected-fiji-poisoning-victim-jill-juarez-speaks-out-after-falling-ill-at-five-star-resort/"&gt;on high alert&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“About half the world’s population is now at risk for dengue with an expected 100-400 million infections occurring each year,” the World Health Organization (WHO) wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue"&gt;recent statement,&lt;/a&gt; as countries like Mexico, Canada, and much of the Caribbean and Latin America are also seeing a rise in cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mosquitoes are the ones responsible for spreading this potentially deadly virus. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the agency, dengue fever typically starts with a high fever, headache, severe muscle and joint pain, nausea, vomiting and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Some people may also feel pain behind their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There isn’t a cure for it, and in mild cases, over-the-counter pain medications can relieve some symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In severe cases — known as dengue hemorrhagic fever — symptoms can escalate to bleeding, breathing difficulties and intense abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Central Division alone has logged over 1,000 dengue cases from January to late March, according to the Fiji Government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;In severe cases, dengue hemorrhagic fever can cause bleeding, breathing issues, and severe abdominal pain. Fiji’s Central Division reported over 1,000 cases from January to late March. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AFP via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The March surge “is above the expected [dengue] levels for the same period last year,” it &lt;a href="https://www.fiji.gov.fj/Media-Centre/News/MINISTRY-OF-HEALTH-DECLARES-DENGUE-FEVER-OUTBREAK#:~:text=The%20Central%20Division%20has%20reported,the%20same%20period%20last%20year."&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The World Mosquito Program &lt;a href="https://www.worldmosquitoprogram.org/world-mosquito-day"&gt;dubbed&lt;/a&gt; 2024 the “worst year for dengue on record,” and the numbers aren’t slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the US, the CDC &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/25/health/dengue-fever-cases-rising-in-popular-spring-break-locations-cdc/"&gt;marked dengue&lt;/a&gt; as a level 1 health alert, advising travelers to “practice usual precautions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/25/health/dengue-fever-cases-rising-in-popular-spring-break-locations-cdc/"&gt;Spring and summer travel &lt;/a&gt;coincide with the peak season for dengue in many countries, increasing the risk of both travel-associated and locally acquired cases in the United States,” the CDC wrote in its recent &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/notices/han00523.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fhan%2F2025%2Fhan00523.html"&gt;health advisory.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The World Mosquito Program dubbed 2024 the “worst year for dengue on record,” and the numbers aren’t slowing down. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AFP via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tourists are being urged to protect themselves by using EPA-registered insect repellents, wearing long sleeves and pants, and sleeping in air-conditioned rooms or ones with screened windows.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;And it’s not just Fiji feeling the sting. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC has flagged several other destinations with dengue fever hot spots, including Brazil, Colombia and the Philippines — all of which have &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/26/us-news/texas-reports-first-locally-transmitted-case-of-dengue-fever-this-year/"&gt;reported more dengue cases&lt;/a&gt; among American travelers returning to US soil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With climate change fueling unpredictable weather patterns — including heavier rains and flooding —experts fear that the conditions are prime for mosquitoes to breed and spread the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If we continue to release planet-warming gases into our atmosphere through industrial pollution, landfills, and other forms of pollution, dengue and other vector-borne illnesses will only thrive,” the Fiji Government warned.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eyes may be the window to the soul, but a person's biological age could be reflected in their facial characteristics. Investigators from Mass General Brigham developed a deep learning algorithm called "FaceAge" that uses a photo of a person's face to predict biological age and survival outcomes for patients with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;They found that patients with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, on average, had a higher FaceAge than those without and appeared about five years older than their &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronological+age/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronological age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older FaceAge predictions were associated with worse overall &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/survival+outcomes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;survival outcomes&lt;/a&gt; across multiple cancer types. They also found that FaceAge outperformed clinicians in predicting short-term life expectancies of patients receiving palliative radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their results are published in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet Digital Health&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We can use &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/artificial+intelligence/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (AI) to estimate a person's &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/biological+age/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;biological age&lt;/a&gt; from face pictures, and our study shows that information can be clinically meaningful," said co-senior and corresponding author Hugo Aerts, Ph.D., director of the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) program at Mass General Brigham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This work demonstrates that a photo like a simple selfie contains important information that could help to inform clinical decision-making and care plans for patients and clinicians. How old someone looks compared to their chronological age really matters—individuals with FaceAges that are younger than their chronological ages do significantly better after &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+therapy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer therapy&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;When patients walk into exam rooms, their appearance may give physicians clues about their overall health and vitality. Those intuitive assessments combined with a patient's chronological age, in addition to many other biological measures, may help determine the best course of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, like anyone, physicians may have biases about a person's age that may influence them, fueling a need for more objective, predictive measures to inform care decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that goal in mind, Mass General Brigham investigators leveraged deep learning and facial recognition technologies to train FaceAge. The tool was trained on 58,851 photos of presumed healthy individuals from public datasets. The team tested the algorithm in a cohort of 6,196 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+patients/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; from two centers, using photographs routinely taken at the start of radiotherapy treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results showed that cancer patients appear significantly older than those without cancer, and their FaceAge, on average, was about five years older than their chronological age. In the cancer patient cohort, older FaceAge was associated with worse survival outcomes, especially in individuals who appeared older than 85, even after adjusting for chronological age, sex, and cancer type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimated survival time at the end of life is difficult to pin down but has important treatment implications in cancer care. The team asked 10 clinicians and researchers to predict short-term life expectancy from 100 photos of patients receiving palliative radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;While there was a wide range in their performance, overall, the clinicians' predictions were only slightly better than a coin flip, even after they were given clinical context, such as the patient's chronological age and cancer status. Yet when clinicians were also provided with the patient's FaceAge information, their predictions improved significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed before this technology could be considered for use in a real-world clinical setting. The research team is testing this technology to predict diseases, general health status, and lifespan. Follow-up studies include expanding this work across different hospitals, looking at patients in different stages of cancer, tracking FaceAge estimates over time, and testing its accuracy against plastic surgery and makeup data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This opens the door to a whole new realm of biomarker discovery from photographs, and its potential goes far beyond cancer care or predicting age," said co-senior author Ray Mak, MD, a faculty member in the AIM program at Mass General Brigham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As we increasingly think of different chronic diseases as diseases of aging, it becomes even more important to be able to accurately predict an individual's aging trajectory. I hope we can ultimately use this technology as an early detection system in a variety of applications, within a strong regulatory and ethical framework, to help save lives."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COLUMBUS, Ohio — May is Lyme Disease Awareness Month, a time to spotlight a growing health concern around tick bites.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alisha Staley's son had the whole world ahead of him when he was diagnosed with chronic Lyme disease years after being bit by a tick.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's been about five and a half years of debilitating symptoms," Staley said. "He's 20 now. This all started when he was 15. If you ask him now, he'd say he still feels like he's 15 because his life stopped at 15."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With thousands of dollars spent on medical testing and treatment, the 20-year-old still battles cognitive and physical pain daily.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"He couldn't experience anything like a normal teen experienced. No high school — he was homeschooled. He can't work, he can't go to college. It is very heartbreaking as a mom," she added.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As thousands are diagnosed each year, health experts suggest the disease is hard to detect. Often times, people are not aware they've been bitten by a tick since sometimes, the typical bullseye rash is not present.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There's ticks that are in nymph form, and they are teeny, teeny tiny like the size of a freckle or a speck of dirt," Staley said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OhioHealth Physician Group family doctor Christopher Johnson spoke about the disease.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The hallmark symptoms are fatigue and headache, body aches, lymph nodes that are swollen. That's also what makes Lyme disease hard is those are kind of generalized symptoms we have when we don't feel well," he said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ohio Department of Health reports an average of 262 Ohioans get Lyme disease from ticks every year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If left untreated, complications can arise.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"He was unable to eat actual food for a year and a half and was getting all his nutrition through medical-grade drinks," Staley said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you suspect you've been bitten by a tick or notice a rash, doctors recommend seeking medical attention immediately.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Staley, she is encouraging people advocate for your health and seek answers.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Be diligent when you are outdoors, so even when you think, 'I wasn't bitten by a tick,' be sure," Staley said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As her son continues to battle the symptoms, Alisha remains optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm still hopeful that there will be a day he is able to go out and accomplish his dreams," she added.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways to reduce the risk of getting bit by a tick:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear long pants and tuck them into your socks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use bug spray.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are hiking, stick to the mowed areas and be aware of tall grass, brush and trees.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

Analyzing two large health databases, scientists found that patients on NRTIs had a 6% to 13% annual decrease in Alzheimer’s risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other HIV drugs, NRTIs block inflammasomes, immune system components implicated in Alzheimer’s development. The researchers now call for clinical trials to test NRTIs — and a new, safer drug called K9 — to determine their potential in preventing Alzheimer’s as cases continue to rise globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; NRTIs were linked to a 6–13% annual reduction in Alzheimer’s risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Only NRTIs, not other HIV drugs, showed this protective association.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers call for clinical trials to test NRTIs and the new drug K9 for Alzheimer’s prevention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Virginia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UVA Health scientists are calling for clinical trials testing the potential of HIV drugs called NRTIs to prevent Alzheimer’s disease after discovering that patients taking the drugs are substantially less likely to develop the memory-robbing condition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers, led by UVA’s Jayakrishna Ambati, MD, previously identified a possible mechanism by which the drugs could prevent Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109678"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows pills." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;NRTIs, or nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, are used to prevent the HIV virus from replicating inside the body. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That promising finding prompted them to analyze two of the nation’s largest health insurance databases to evaluate Alzheimer’s risk among patients prescribed the medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one, the risk of developing Alzheimer’s decreased 6% every year the patients were taking the drugs. In the other, the annual decrease was 13%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s estimated that over 10 million people around the world develop Alzheimer’s disease annually,” said Ambati, founding director of UVA’s Center for Advanced Vision Science and the DuPont Guerry III Professor in the University of Virginia School of Medicine’s Department of Ophthalmology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that taking these drugs could prevent approximately 1 million new cases of Alzheimer’s disease&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;every year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventing Alzheimer’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NRTIs, or nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, are used to prevent the HIV virus from replicating inside the body. But Ambati and his team previously determined that the drugs can also prevent the activation of inflammasomes, important agents of our immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These proteins have been implicated in the development of Alzheimer’s disease, so Ambati and his colleagues wanted to see if patients taking the inflammasome-blocking drugs were less likely to develop Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do that, they reviewed 24 years of patient data contained in the U.S. Veterans Health Administration Database – made up heavily of men – and 14 years of data in the MarketScan database of commercially insured patients, which offers a broader representation of the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They looked for patients who were at least 50 years old and were taking medications for either HIV or hepatitis B, another disease treated with NRTIs. They excluded patients with a previous Alzheimer’s diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, the researchers identified more than 270,000 patients who met the study criteria and then analyzed how many went on to develop Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after adjusting for factors that might cloud the results, such as whether patients had pre-existing medical conditions, the researchers determined that the reduction in Alzheimer’s risk among patients on NRTIs was “significant and substantial,” they report in a new scientific paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that patients taking other types of HIV medications did not show the same reduction in Alzheimer’s risk as those on NRTIs. Based on that, they say that NRTIs warrant clinical testing to determine their ability to ward off Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If successful, the benefits could be tremendous, as Alzheimer’s rates are climbing dramatically. Nearly 7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s today, but that number is expected to climb to 13 million by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, the estimated annual cost of care for Alzheimer’s and other dementias could rise from $360 billion to almost $1 trillion, the Alzheimer’s Association reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have also developed a new inflammasome-blocking drug called K9, which is a safer and more effective version of NRTIs,” Ambati said. “This drug is already in clinical trials for other diseases, and we plan to also test K9 in Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings Published&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have published their findings in Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team consisted of Joseph Magagnoli, Meenakshi Ambati, Tammy Cummings, Joseph Nguyen, Claire C.

                &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an appearance on NewsNation on April 30, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4i7kGh63jo"&gt;was asked&lt;/a&gt; about his responsibility to encourage vaccination against preventable diseases such as the measles. Kennedy said that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) should focus on alternative treatment options for measles, claiming that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine “contains a lot of aborted fetus debris” and “DNA particles.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are populations in our country—like the Mennonites in Texas—who are most afflicted, and they have religious objections to the vaccination because the MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris and DNA particles,” Kennedy said. “So, they don’t want to take it. So, we ought to be able to take care of those populations when they get sick, and that’s one of the things that CDC has not done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no “fetus debris” or “DNA particles” in the MMR vaccine. The rubella vaccine—which along with the measles and mumps vaccines makes up the MMR shot—was initially developed using a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cell-line"&gt;cell line&lt;/a&gt;, cultured cells that reproduce indefinitely, taken from a single aborted fetus in 1962, but those fetal cells are not in the finished vaccine product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;        


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why researchers used fetal cells requires some background on vaccine development. Researchers develop vaccines by injecting viruses into living cells, adapting them to provoke a more effective response from the human immune system. But to do this safely, they need host cells that are free of other viruses or contaminants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first half of the 20th century, finding suitable cells that could safely host viruses over long enough periods of time for them to adapt posed challenges. Unlike today, “there was good reason for vaccine hesitancy back then, because there weren’t very safe vaccines,” Dr. S. Jay Olshansky, an epidemiology and biostatistics professor at the University of Illinois–Chicago, told &lt;strong&gt;The Dispatch Fact Check&lt;/strong&gt;. “Having a completely pure, safe medium for growing viral vaccines was critical.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, live cells taken from humans were &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10724055/#:~:text=Certain%20cells%20derived%20from%20fetal%20tissue%20survive%20and%20proliferate%20in%20culture%20more%20readily%20than%20adult%20cells%20and%20can%20support%20large%20amounts%20of%20viral%20production%20for%20making%20many%20vaccines"&gt;not considered&lt;/a&gt; suitable for vaccine development because of inefficient growth and survival rates, and mass vaccine production would require ample amounts harvested from living donors. Additionally, there were &lt;a href="https://historyofvaccines.org/vaccines-101/how-are-vaccines-made/human-cell-strains-vaccine-development#:~:text=In%20the%20late%201960s%2C%20there%20was%20concern%20in%20the%20country%20that%20a%20vaccine%20developed%20using%20human%20cells%20could%20be%20contaminated%20with%20other%20pathogens%2C%20though%20this%20concern%20was%20not%20supported%20by%20documented%20evidence."&gt;contamination concerns&lt;/a&gt; with human cells, which, though not supported by scientific research, were considered more likely to carry pathogens susceptible to humans. So, scientists turned to what they thought was the next best thing available—cells taken from monkey kidneys. “Those animals were adult animals that had been exposed to viruses during the course of their lives, and those kidney cells often contain those viruses,” Olshansky said. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5689800/#:~:text=However%2C%20it%20was,%5B15%5D."&gt;These viruses&lt;/a&gt;, some of which were lethal or linked to cancer, could be passed down through the vaccine to its recipients and sometimes even vaccine workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1961, Dr. Leonard Hayflick of the Wistar Institute, a biomedical research nonprofit based in Philadelphia, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0014482761901926?via%3Dihub"&gt;discovered that&lt;/a&gt; human cells were not eternal but subdivided on average about 50 times over their lifespan before dying—a cutoff known today as the “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hayflick-limit"&gt;Hayflick limit&lt;/a&gt;.” From that discovery, Hayflick saw the potential to reshape vaccine development. “He believed that if you had a pure cell line, uncontaminated by viruses from the outside world—which would come from a fetus, for example—no exposure to the outside world … that might be the perfect medium to grow safe vaccines,” Olshanksy, who worked closely with Hayflick and is currently writing a book about him, explained. “And he was right.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If cells subdivided a set amount of times, Hayflick wondered, could the subdivision process be paused by freezing the cells, allowing for the proliferation of the cells over long periods of time? To experiment, Hayflick took a sample of cells taken from lung tissue of a fetus electively aborted in Stockholm, Sweden—unrelated to any ongoing scientific research—in 1962. He discovered that “the duration of life of the cells was extended by the amount of time that they were frozen,” Olshansky explained. After the cells thawed out, they continued replicating and indeed remembered how many times they had subdivided before being frozen. “You could actually stop the process of cell division and it will renew itself, remembering how many cell divisions had already occurred. That was the key finding,” Olshanky said, “the ability of the cells to know how many times they replicated before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers today, a year from now, and 50 years from now could use cells from the same cell line, providing a safe and standard environmental host for viral vaccines to grow in. And that’s precisely what happened with the fetal cell line Hayflick &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0014482765902119?via%3Dihub"&gt;experimented with&lt;/a&gt;, named WI-38. That cell line provided a sterile environment for viral vaccines to develop safely, without fear of contamination. While the cell line from that fetus is no longer used to manufacture new vaccines, it is still used today in vaccine testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the MMR vaccine, the WI-38 cell line was used to develop vaccines for poliomyelitis, varicella (chicken pox), herpes zoster, adenovirus, rabies, and Hepatitis A. In 2017, Hayflick and Olshansky co-authored &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5689800/"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; in which they estimated that about 4.5 billion cases of those diseases have been averted globally with a vaccine developed using the WI-38 cell line or a derivative from it, saving about 10.3 million lives. “Nearly everyone born in the developed world since 1962 received at least one vaccine manufactured with the WI-38 cell strain,” Hayflick and Olshansky wrote, “along with a growing proportion of the population in developing nations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although WI-38 is today retired from vaccine development, other fetal-based cell lines are still used to create new vaccines. &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.com/article/is-the-pro-life-movement-on-a-collision/"&gt;COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; produced by Moderna, Pfizer, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, and AstraZeneca, were developed using a cell line taken from a different fetus aborted in the 1970s. A &lt;a href="https://eppc.org/news/statement-from-pro-life-catholic-scholars-on-the-moral-acceptability-of-receiving-covid-19-vaccines/"&gt;March 2021 statement&lt;/a&gt; from a group of pro-life Catholic scholars, stated, “While there is a technical causal linkage between each of the current vaccines and prior abortions of human persons, we are all agreed, that connection does not mean that vaccine use contributes to the evil of abortion or shows disrespect for the remains of unborn human beings.” It added, “As a matter of scientific fact, no fetal ‘body parts’ are present in these immortal cell lines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has made other misleading claims about the MMR vaccine in recent media appearances. In &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/rfk-jr-says-people-should-get-the-measles-vaccine/"&gt;an April 8 interview&lt;/a&gt; with CBS News, Kennedy publicly recommended that the public receive the MMR vaccine, but tempered his endorsement by falsely claiming in the same interview that “the vaccine wanes very quickly” and that many potential health risks are unknown “because they’re not safety tested.” MMR vaccines have undergone rigorous safety testing, and those who have received two doses of the shot have &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636"&gt;lifetime protection&lt;/a&gt; from the viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;The immunization director at North Dakota Health and Human Services says the current measles outbreak is the first the disease has appeared in the state fourteen years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These were the first cases that we've had reported since our last case which was in 2011."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of today, Molly Howell says there are nine confirmed cases of measles, all in unvaccinated individuals from Williams County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howell says some of the individuals attended schools in Williston while they were infectious. Currently 180 students are isolating for 21 days in an attempt to stop the spread. She says students who did not have at least one dose of measles vaccine were asked to isolate. Howell says measles is extremely infectious, and that 9 out of 10 exposed unvaccinated individuals will develop symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howell says vaccination clinics are underway in Williston this evening and tomorrow. She also says HHS has revised immunization recommendations for anyone living in or traveling to Williams County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Usually people don't get the MMR vaccine until they're 12 months old. We are recommending that in Williams County, infants receive the MMR vaccine as early as six months of age. And then also, usually the second dose is given at 4 to 6 years of age before kids go to kindergarten - we are recommending that kids get that dose early as well, so they can receive it if it's been at least 28 days since their first MMR dose."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howell says state health officials have been preparing for potential outbreaks by conducting tabletop exercises with schools, local public health departments and at Health and Human Services. She says fact sheets are ready to go with talking points, the state lab is ready for testing and a dashboard is also ready to keep the public informed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howell says MMR vaccines are widely available, so anyone interested is encouraged to speak with their health care providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccinated individuals - so if you have one dose of MMR, it's 93 percent effective, and with two doses, it's 97 percent effective - so it's a really good, effective vaccine. Most North Dakotans are vaccinated, so we don't want them panicking about the situation."&lt;/p&gt;

The woman had undergone pioneering gene treatments for a rare degenerative disease, and researchers hoped studying her brain would provide them with invaluable data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ashtyn Fellenz died at age 24 on December 5, 2024. As a child, she was diagnosed with Canavan Disease, a &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/angelman-syndrome-symptoms-colin-farrell-son-cause-b2736546.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rare genetic disorder;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;rare genetic disorder&lt;/a&gt; that causes the degeneration of the coating that protects nerves and a loss of white matter in the brain, &lt;a href="https://www.fox6now.com/news/donated-brain-thrown-out-childrens-wisconsin-profoundly-sorry" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to Fox 6;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to Fox 6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Typically, children suffering from the disease progressively lose the ability to move their muscles and effectively become locked in to their own bodies. Without treatment, most children with the disease die before the age of 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2003, when she was three years old, Fellenz underwent experimental surgery that saw a functional gene injected into her brain, with the hopes that it would displace the defective one. While it didn't cure her disease, it did buy her a decade's worth of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr Paola Leone, a professor of Cell Biology at Rowan University, requested that Fellenz's brain be preserved after her death, hoping that it could provide priceless data about both the disease and the body's response to her experimental treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children's Hospital of Wisconsin's Milwaukee campus. The hospital accidentally discarded the brain of Ashtyn Fellenz, a 24-year-old woman who died from Canavan Diease. The brain was meant to be donated for scientific research that could have helped scientists better understand the illness and pioneering genetic treatments that woman had received when she was a child. (Google Maps)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While 16 other children also received similar treatment, the circumstances of her death made her brain especially ideal for preservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to Leone, most Canavan patients die in their homes, and their brain tissues degrade by the time they can be properly autopsied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fellenz, however, died at Children's Hospital Wisconsin, where doctors could work quickly to save her brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The scenario was perfect," Leone told Fox 6. "She was in the hospital. The dry ice was there, ready to go."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Donating the brain was always the plan following her death, according to her parents, Scott and Arlo Fellenz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It was no question that we had to do that,” Scott said. “It was a big part of her legacy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unfortunately, the secrets of Fellenz's brain will never be uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When she died on December 5, officials at Children's Wisconsin decided that a previous donation consent form signed by her parents was out of date and that they would need to fill out another before the brain could be shipped to Living BioBank at the Children's Hospital in Dayton, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite Leone providing Children's Wisconsin with the consent form, a month passed and the sample still hadn’t been sent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On January 13, more than a month after Fellenz's death, Dr Lauren Parsons, Director of Pathology at Children's Wisconsin, wrote an email to Leone thanking her for her "patience" and noting that "holidays and some leadership transitions" had kept the staff tied up, according to Fox 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Two more months passed without the brain being sent, Leone said, adding that many of her emails questioning the hold up were left unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Scott Fellenz told the broadcaster that Parsons "literally ghosted [Leone] for two months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In March, Arlo Fellenz called the hospital demanding answers. Her call was returned from the hospital's "grief services" workers, who wanted to set up a meeting. She waved off the meeting and demanded they tell her what they needed to say over the phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The hospital then told the family they had accidentally “disposed” of Fellenz's brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"They tossed out her brain. How can you do that with a brain?" Arlo said during an interview with Fox 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Half of Fellenz's brain did eventually get shipped to Ohio, but Leone was most interested in the information that the other half — the half that had not received the experimental injection — could reveal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fellenz's father said it felt like he had lost his daughter again. For Leone, the loss also represents a loss of potential knowledge that could have helped people suffering from gene conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"This would have just led, just paved the way for any other application of gene therapy into the brain to let us know if gene therapy can persist," she told the broadcaster. "It’s a loss of information that would have been precious and cited for the years to come, for the centuries to come, because this is the one and only specimen, not just for Canavan, for any other gene therapy,"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A spokesperson for Children's Wisconsin said they were “profoundly sorry” for the error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"We were honored to support Ashtyn’s family’s wish for her legacy to help others. As we communicated to the family when this error was discovered, and reiterate now, our team is profoundly sorry this happened, and we continue to take steps to reinforce our protocols to help ensure this does not occur again,” they said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The availability of human tissue to support life-changing and lifesaving medical research is critical to offering hope to families. We take seriously our work to support research through proper tissue collection, storage and usage. We are deeply grateful for Ashtyn’s life and for her family’s advocacy and care, and again offer our most sincere regret and apology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When questioned further by Fox 6, the hospital said they have a “comprehensive process” to manage donated tissue, aspects of which were “not followed,” leading to the error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Fellenz family have now hired an attorney to represent them, and would use any money to help with Canavan research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 20:20:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOamszdmI2ZGlZWmNvTUtpMU8tQUJOZXlXQ0RacURqTXFfb0paY0ozc2RyMXZnYmx6WllRbWRkUzE3MFRWSjVjSHl2OGRWLUVmdXhuWFVxMlQ1QWZYLUFyOHVoaUZ3SHBnVEhiMFhhdHRjZDUxQmRZQkZrODcwa0RiOGFB</guid></item><item><title>安大略县确诊麻疹病例- 13wham.com | Measles case confirmed in Ontario County - 13wham.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE9semtlVlA2ZHdtc3QtUzl5eHhjdjlVRTZqV3Vmb296QjgtQ054b0twUXp2dUVpOVFyTnh4eUljcUV0LS13MHp0WmwxaHVfVHpjTjd5Zng5VzlTcmFlNDVmZmRKaEluenRmYUhua2tjNE5UVjF5bFVnRjN3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="index-module_byline__Pmfw index-module_storyBylineContainer__uFq5" id="js-Story-Byline-undefined"&gt;&lt;div class="index-module_bylineTextContainer__MIqD"&gt;&lt;p class="index-module_storyBylineText__yH2g"&gt;by WHAM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="index-module_storyDatelineText__wPM6"&gt;Thu, May 8th 2025 at 3:55 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="index-module_storyDatelineText__wPM6"&gt;&lt;span class="index-module_updatedText__YSrj"&gt;Updated &lt;/span&gt;Thu, May 8th 2025 at 3:57 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>13wham.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 19:55:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE9semtlVlA2ZHdtc3QtUzl5eHhjdjlVRTZqV3Vmb296QjgtQ054b0twUXp2dUVpOVFyTnh4eUljcUV0LS13MHp0WmwxaHVfVHpjTjd5Zng5VzlTcmFlNDVmZmRKaEluenRmYUhua2tjNE5UVjF5bFVnRjN3</guid></item><item><title>大脑信号如何塑造其保护性废物处理网络-神经科学新闻 | How Brain Signals Shape Its Protective Waste Disposal Network - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTFB6Q2w2TzVpd2UyaFFNWEdyZ2o2YVMzT21GU1BmME5WRU9POXNiMHYyQXFlOUxZM3NsdzhxVWN1Z0Joem5aYmpBbjFiQXg1Y00xZlZpZzR6QWFpRGphZ1RxenBOU0ZNTmFDS0VQbg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;The brain’s meningeal lymphatic system plays a key role in clearing waste and transporting immune cells, but until now, how it develops was unclear. Using zebrafish and advanced imaging, researchers revealed that neural activity regulates this system by influencing specialized glial cells that release Vegfc, a key growth factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These glial cells, along with fibroblasts that help process Vegfc, guide the formation and precise placement of lymphatic vessels, ensuring they remain confined to the meninges. This neural-glia-fibroblast interaction prevents harmful immune invasion into brain tissue, showcasing the brain’s ability to coordinate its own microenvironment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Activity Drives Development:&lt;/strong&gt; Increased neural activity boosts brain meningeal lymphatic development through Vegfc-expressing glial cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glia-Fibroblast Cooperation:&lt;/strong&gt; Vegfc must be processed by fibroblasts to guide lymphatic vessel growth precisely at the brain surface.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective Barrier:&lt;/strong&gt; This regulatory axis ensures lymphatic vessels do not invade the brain parenchyma, preventing immune disruptions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Chinese Academy of Science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over the past decade, intensive studies have shown that the brain’s meningeal lymphatic system acts as the brain’s “waste disposal network,” maintaining homeostasis by clearing metabolic waste and transporting immune cells. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the mechanism underlying its developmental regulation remains unknown. How does this intricate system form, and which cells or signals govern its specific spatial arrangement in the meninges?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109667"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study shows that the brain acts as a coordinator of its microenvironment, and reveals a novel neural-glia-fibroblast-lymphatic regulatory axis. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; and led by Dr. Du Jiulin’s lab at the Institute of Neuroscience, Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has uncovered the core regulatory mechanism of brain meningeal lymphatic system development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking advantage of in vivo long-term imaging in zebrafish, in combination with genetic manipulations and neural activity studies, researchers found that increasing neural activity—for example, visual stimulation—significantly enhances the development of mural lymphatic endothelial cells (muLECs) in the leptomeninges, while inhibiting neural activity—for example, visual deprivation—leads to a significant reduction in the muLEC number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing on Vegfc, a key factor necessary for lymphatic system development, researchers identified a specific glial subpopulation—slc6a11b+ RAs—that expresses Vegfc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cells extend fibers to the brain surface, making them the main source of Vegfc in the brain. Deletion of slc6a11b+ RAs impaired muLEC development, while upregulating these cells’ Vegfc signaling enhanced muLEC development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, researchers found that the activity of slc6a11b+ RAs and their Vegfc expression levels are positively regulated by neural activity. They found that the precursor Vegfc (pro-Vegfc) secreted by slc6a11b+ RAs requires the cooperation of ccbe1+ fibroblasts to be converted into its mature form (mVegfc).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cross-tissue collaboration precisely restricted the distribution of mVegfc to the brain-meningeal interface, ensuring that lymphatic endothelial cells were confined to the brain surface, preventing their invasion into the brain parenchyma, which could cause immune disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study shows that the brain acts as a coordinator of its microenvironment, and reveals a novel neural-glia-fibroblast-lymphatic regulatory axis. This provides a new framework for understanding how the brain adapts its lymphatic network based on functional needs, and explains why the brain’s meningeal lymphatic system remains confined to the meninges, avoiding invasion of the brain parenchyma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, intervening in this regulatory network may offer new perspectives on the role of the meningeal lymphatic system in neurological diseases and developing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.cas.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Liu Jia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.cas.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chinese Academy of Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Liu Jia – Chinese Academy of Science&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.04.008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neural-activity-regulated and glia-mediated control of brain lymphatic development&lt;/a&gt;” by Du Jiulin et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural-activity-regulated and glia-mediated control of brain lymphatic development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nervous system regulates peripheral immune responses under physiological and pathological conditions, but the brain’s impact on immune system development remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meningeal mural lymphatic endothelial cells (muLECs), embedded in the leptomeninges, form an immune niche surrounding the brain that contributes to brain immunosurveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we report that the brain controls the development of muLECs via a specialized glial subpopulation, &lt;em&gt;slc6a11b+&lt;/em&gt; radial astrocytes (RAs), a process modulated by neural activity in zebrafish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;slc6a11b+&lt;/em&gt; RAs, with processes extending to the meninges, govern muLEC formation by expressing vascular endothelial growth factor C (&lt;em&gt;vegfc&lt;/em&gt;). Moreover, neural activity regulates muLEC development, and this regulation requires Vegfc in &lt;em&gt;slc6a11b+&lt;/em&gt; RAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, &lt;em&gt;slc6a11b+&lt;/em&gt; RAs cooperate with calcium-binding EGF domain 1 (&lt;em&gt;ccbe1&lt;/em&gt;)+ fibroblasts to restrict muLEC growth on the brain surface via controlling mature Vegfc distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, our study uncovers a glia-mediated and neural-activity-regulated control of brain lymphatic development and highlights the importance of inter-tissue cellular cooperation in development.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 19:50:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTFB6Q2w2TzVpd2UyaFFNWEdyZ2o2YVMzT21GU1BmME5WRU9POXNiMHYyQXFlOUxZM3NsdzhxVWN1Z0Joem5aYmpBbjFiQXg1Y00xZlZpZzR6QWFpRGphZ1RxenBOU0ZNTmFDS0VQbg</guid></item><item><title>猫禽流感病例激增引发对人类溢出的担忧- CIDRAP | Spike in avian flu cases in cats triggers worry about human spillover - CIDRAP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxNOTRUSGdEVGRzbkVkNF9FczE3RkRkT0JVWUlkSlFlRl9wa1NrbEVOM0RXNUYtdkduRklDaHhaZFFvaWVjYUkyX2haRkZwR0JNYjhHbFVrRFF2TXlVWUd5N1g5SnpwbnRKckd3emdyVWFSLV9VWFR3NldnNko4dzBsa2dpWVlLcEw3SjJDZDV0NHM2SjNlbDMzbVYzY3pFak5scWhaNU5rNTFOeUd1eXhvcHFXSHhxQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Maryland scientists are calling for increased surveillance of avian flu in domestic cats after a global &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ofid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ofid/ofaf261/8123920"&gt;&lt;span&gt;review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 20 years of published data reveals a dramatic uptick in feline infections—and the number of ways cats are being infected—after the emergence of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in other mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored," the researchers wrote yesterday in &lt;em&gt;Open Forum Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt;. "Domestic cats are susceptible to AIV [avian influenza virus] infection and provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover to humans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team conducted a systematic review of scientific literature from 2004 to 2024 to track the epidemiology and global distribution of AIV in cats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;'New and unknown transmission routes' &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review identified 48 articles that detailed 607 AIV infections in 12 feline species (ranging from pet cats to tigers), 302 of them resulting in death, in 18 countries. Half of the cases were from Asia, followed by Europe (25%) and North America (16.7%). H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b infections were reported in Finland, France, Poland, the United States, Italy, Peru, and South Korea in five species (135 domestic cats, 2 bobcats, and 1 lynx, caracal, and lion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observed a drastic flux in the number of AIV infections among domestic cats in 2023 and 2024, commensurate with the emergence of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We observed a drastic flux in the number of AIV infections among domestic cats in 2023 and 2024, commensurate with the emergence of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b," which was consistent with the emergence and increased transmission of the clade in birds and mammals, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoos, animal shelters, farms and private rural land were the most common settings of infections in cats. In total, 62.6% of the cases involved domestic cats, and 71.3% of the 423 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed cases were fatal. Most infections were confirmed or suspected to result from bird-to-cat transmission, most often from eating dead pigeons, chickens, or other birds but also from contaminated raw chicken feed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Interestingly, cases of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b recently reported by the Colorado Health Department included two indoor-only domestic cats with no known exposure to infected animals," the authors wrote. "This observation raises concerns regarding new and unknown transmission routes of AIV to domestic cats."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;High death rate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 92.3% of feline cases were identified as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), and 7.7% were low-pathogenic avian flu. Among the PCR-positive infections, HPAI made up 99.7% of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the 98% of the PCR-confirmed feline infections identified as HPAI H5N1, 33.8% were clade 2.3.4.4b, and 96.4% were domestic cats. Of these cats, the case-fatality rate was 52.8% for H5N1, and 89.6% were clade 2.3.4.4b.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the studies that described symptoms, respiratory and neurologic illness were most common and often led to death. Blindness and chorioretinitis (inflammation of the choroid and retina of the eye) were also recently reported in two infected domestic cats that contracted the virus from drinking raw colostrum and milk containing high viral loads from dairy cattle infected with the clade 2.3.4.4b virus. Subclinical feline infections have also been reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This clinical observation suggests that exposure route and dose of AIV might impact disease presentation and severity," the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Infections expected to rise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The avian flu outbreaks that started in February 2024 in dairy cattle are worrisome because most infections in mammals have been in carnivores or omnivores, they said: "The transmission to herbivores is interesting, as avian influenza is often foodborne in mammalian hosts, and tends to result from a new host eating an infected host."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infection of ruminants rules out the predation or scavenging route of transmission in this case and suggests that other routes of transmission are occurring, in addition to cattle-to-cattle transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The infection of ruminants rules out the predation or scavenging route of transmission in this case and suggests that other routes of transmission are occurring, in addition to cattle-to-cattle transmission," they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avian flu has infected 950 people worldwide and killed half of them. From April 2022 (when cumulative data on US human cases started being collected) and January 2025, the country has recorded 66 human infections and 1 death, the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The virus has evolved, and the way that it jumps between species—from birds to cats, and now between cows and cats, cats and humans—is very concerning," lead and senior author Kristen Coleman, PhD, said in a University of Maryland &lt;a href="https://sph.umd.edu/news/bird-flu-study-points-risk-another-pandemic"&gt;&lt;span&gt;press release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "As summer approaches, we are anticipating cases on farms and in the wild to rise again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of particular concern, she said, is the potential for the virus to enter animal shelters, which could cause large outbreaks potentially involving people, similar to or worse than what happened in New York City in 2016 with a different avian flu strain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cases likely an underestimate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;No cases of human-to-human transmission of avian flu have been reported, but the investigators worry that as the virus spreads and evolves, it could become transmissible through the air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We estimate that this phenomenon is underreported in the scientific literature and argue that increased surveillance among domestic cats is urgently needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our future research will involve studies to determine the prevalence of HPAI and other influenza viruses in high-risk cat populations such as dairy barn cats," coauthor and doctoral student Ian Gill Bemis said in the release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of new and unknown transmission routes is worrisome, because cats are not monitored for avian flu, and when testing is performed, it is usually done after death, the authors said. Also, infected cats often experience encephalitis (brain swelling) and other severe symptoms that are often misdiagnosed as rabies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We estimate that this phenomenon is underreported in the scientific literature and argue that increased surveillance among domestic cats is urgently needed," they concluded.&lt;span&gt; "As feline-to-human transmission of AIV has been documented, and potential airborne and fomite-mediated transmission implicated, farm and free-roaming cat owners, veterinarians, zoo keepers, and animal shelter volunteers may have a heightened risk of AIV infection during epizootics among birds and mammals."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state Department of Health said that three patients, who are residents of Orange County, are less than 5 years of age and who recently traveled internationally all have tested positive. The DOH is monitoring the cases in coordination with the Orange County Health Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ontario County public health officials also confirmed a measles case from a resident who they say had been exposed outside the United States and tested positive in late March. They have since recovered. The county says that resident isolated at home until they were no longer contagious and no additional exposures or cases have been identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cases bring the total number of cases in New York this year to eight. Health officials in early April began advising New Yorkers traveling out of the country or to areas experiencing an outbreak to be fully immunized against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have confirmed more than 930 &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-mmr-vaccine-texas-rfk-ff8e744b19ead87698d7217de02814ee" target="_blank"&gt;measles cases&lt;/a&gt; so far this year, more than triple the amount seen in all of 2024, with the majority of cases in Texas and other parts of the Southwest. Officials are also monitoring outbreaks in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"All New Yorkers are urged to protect themselves by making sure they're up to date on their measles, mumps and rubella vaccines along with other important, lifesaving immunizations and be aware of health advisories when traveling with unvaccinated individuals, especially young children," the DOH said in a release Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some lucky people have rare genetic mutations that enable them to feel well-rested after just four hours of sleep, while the rest of us need around eight hours to function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers have identified one of these mutations, named SIK3-N783Y, in a human super-sleeper. The team then studied the mutation in genetically modified mice and found that the mice carrying this mutation also got less shut-eye, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly identified mutation is one of several that researchers have linked to shorter sleep patterns. Scientists hope that by understanding the genetics of natural short sleepers, who seem to thrive on less sleep, they can develop better treatments for sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our bodies continue to work when we go to bed," detoxifying themselves and repairing damage, study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bms.ucsf.edu/people/ying-hui-fu-phd" target="_blank" data-url="https://bms.ucsf.edu/people/ying-hui-fu-phd" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ying-Hui Fu&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist and geneticist at the University of California, San Francisco, told &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_1216547298855022909&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-025-01402-7&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fsleep%2Frare-genetic-mutation-lets-some-people-thrive-on-just-4-hours-of-shut-eye" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01402-7" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-025-01402-7&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fsleep%2Frare-genetic-mutation-lets-some-people-thrive-on-just-4-hours-of-shut-eye" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

They found that mice with the mutation slept around 31 minutes less than those without it, and 54 minutes less following a period of sleep deprivation, which the researchers induced by gently handling the mice, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice normally sleep for around &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2022/06/29/teenage-mice-deprived-of-sleep-are-less-outgoing-as-adults/" target="_blank" data-url="https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2022/06/29/teenage-mice-deprived-of-sleep-are-less-outgoing-as-adults/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;12 hours per day&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, much longer than humans, so this new mutation-linked sleep reduction of up to 54 minutes is less than is seen in human subjects with naturally short sleep patterns. The researchers noted that this could be due to mice usually experiencing more fragmented sleep than humans, or the result of their mouse strain being inbred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers still have much to learn about the genetics of natural short sleepers and their nighttime superpower. The new findings highlight that Sik3 is a promising therapeutic target for researchers to explore as they attempt to improve sleep efficiency and satisfaction, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 id="science-of-sleep-quiz-how-much-do-you-know-about-sleep-and-dreams-3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/health/sleep/science-of-sleep-quiz-how-much-do-you-know-about-sleep-and-dreams" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/sleep/science-of-sleep-quiz-how-much-do-you-know-about-sleep-and-dreams"&gt;Science of sleep quiz&lt;/a&gt;: How much do you know about sleep and dreams?&lt;/h2&gt;

	A man was allegedly bitten by a raccoon in a
Market Basket parking lot in Portsmouth, New Hampshire on Tuesday.

				&lt;p&gt;A raccoon attacked a man in a Market Basket parking lot in Portsmouth, New Hampshire on Tuesday, officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portsmouth Police received a report from a third party that a young male was attacked by a raccoon in the vicinity of Market Basket, Sergeant Jordan Wells told Boston.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the scene, the raccoon and the alleged victim were not present when police arrived. However, roughly an hour later, police said they got a call from the man, who was receiving medical care. He is currently in stable condition, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the incident, police were not able to locate the raccoon, according to authorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is “no definitive information” confirming that the raccoon was rabid, Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not uncommon to see raccoons in the daytime during the spring, according to Wells. Just earlier this week, police were notified about a potentially rabid raccoon near Hannaford’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This time of year is when you have all the female raccoons that will be out there in the day foraging for food sometimes,” he said. “They can be extremely aggressive.”&lt;/p&gt;

Deep sleep is when the trash collector rolls through the body and collects trash. If you don’t hit that deep sleep window, trash accumulates in your body. People think if you go to bed at 2 and wake up at 11 that you somehow make up for lost sleep. You don’t. The sleep patterns are different, that’s why being on time—and consistent—is so important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to ask you about my classic combo of three drinks and a cigarette.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah. I think those things are going to make you less happy, less robust, less emotionally vibrant, and dull your senses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you ever drink at any point in your life?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not really. I have in years past, just tried it a little bit, but really no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And no cigarettes I presume?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mmhmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sipped one once and thought it was crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you remember what flavor it was?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t. But it’s clearly an acquired taste. It’s not like it hits the tongue and you’re like, “Damn, this is beautiful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you a caffeine guy at all?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do a little bit of matcha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I also have tattoos, and when I was researching you I found something about how tattoos can increase the risk of skin cancer.

Now, they’re getting them removed as fast as they can.

I got this years ago before I started this endeavor. Large tattoos increase your risk of skin cancer and lymphoma by 137% and 173%, if they’re larger than the palm of your hand. Tattoos generally, about a 33% increase. But, that was a study with 2,600 Danish twins, and only 16 or so were discordant behaviors. It’s a relatively small study, so it’s suggestive, not conclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But yeah, tattoos with bad inks create cancer risk. There are safe inks to use. If you’re going to get a tattoo, just do it smaller than 2x2 and get a safe ink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want you to guess how old I am based on looking at me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ooh, brutal!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;24?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m 29.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You look great.
