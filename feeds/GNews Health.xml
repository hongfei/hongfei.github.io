&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📊 &lt;strong&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/strong&gt; completed the largest whole-body imaging project, scanning 100,000 volunteers over 15 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🧠 The project provides an unprecedented dataset for advancing disease research, diagnostics, and treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💡 Researchers are leveraging the data to develop AI models for early disease detection and understanding organ aging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔬 Over 1,300 scientific papers have been published, showcasing the transformative impact of this &lt;strong&gt;comprehensive dataset&lt;/strong&gt; on medical science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Biobank has achieved a monumental breakthrough in medical imaging, completing the world’s largest whole-body imaging project. This endeavor, stretching over 15 years, saw the participation of 100,000 volunteers, who contributed immensely to advancing disease research and diagnostics. By scanning brains, hearts, abdomens, blood vessels, bones, and joints, UK Biobank has provided researchers with an unprecedented dataset. This accomplishment is not just about numbers; it represents a significant leap forward in understanding human health, influencing prevention methods, and enhancing treatment options worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Detailed Look Inside the Human Body&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen years ago, a cohort of 100,000 dedicated volunteers embarked on an ambitious journey with the UK Biobank, contributing to what would become the largest imaging project of its kind. Among them, Alison, a member of the Participant Advisory Group, emphasized the importance of this initiative, stating her motivation was to &lt;i&gt;“create a healthier future for all of us to enjoy.”&lt;/i&gt; These volunteers provided critical data, including lifestyle information and blood samples, which paved the way for groundbreaking research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project, backed by a substantial £60 million investment, involved extensive imaging sessions. Each volunteer underwent five-hour imaging appointments, where researchers collected 12,000 Magnetic Resonance (MR) images of vital organs such as the brain, heart, and abdomen. Additionally, ultrasounds of carotid arteries and comprehensive body scans were conducted, measuring bone density and body fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="3dJWyw35s9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/were-redefining-urban-mobility-envos-utility-personal-transporter-unleashed-as-the-future-of-compact-electric-vehicles/"&gt;“We’re Redefining Urban Mobility”: Envo’s Utility Personal Transporter Unleashed as the Future of Compact Electric Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imaging data has equipped scientists with the tools to explore diseases in unprecedented detail. According to Professor Louise Thomas, &lt;i&gt;“researchers can measure the size, shape, and composition of nearly every organ and tissue in the body in seconds, rather than hours per person.”&lt;/i&gt; This capability marks a significant advancement in the realm of medical research, offering insights previously unattainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Bright Future for Disease Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Biobank’s imaging data is already catalyzing significant discoveries in disease research. Scientists are leveraging this vast dataset to develop advanced AI models, such as one for a healthy heart, which aims to detect diseases early. Notably, researchers are beginning to grasp the concept that our organs might age biologically at a different rate than we do. This understanding is reshaping how we perceive age-related diseases and their onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kFAML4AF8u"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/were-about-to-break-the-ocean-speed-limit-revolutionary-kite-powered-sailboat-closes-in-on-historic-world-record/"&gt;“We’re About to Break the Ocean Speed Limit”: Revolutionary Kite-Powered Sailboat Closes In on Historic World Record&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the remarkable findings from this dataset is the intricate connection between the heart and brain. Such revelations are possible due to the immense scale of data being integrated into machine learning platforms, allowing for disease prediction years before symptoms manifest. Professor Paul Matthews highlighted the potential of this data, remarking on a study that used brain imaging from 20,000 participants to develop an AI tool capable of predicting the onset of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. &lt;i&gt;“The beauty of UK Biobank is the breadth of the data collected… the imaging scans add another layer of exquisite detail,”&lt;/i&gt; he noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unprecedented Scale and Impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Biobank’s imaging project is remarkable not just for its scale but also for its profound impact on the scientific community. Described as more than ten times larger than any prior studies, this project offers researchers the ability to discern disease patterns previously invisible. By providing a panoramic view of the human body, the data allows for a holistic understanding of how various aspects of our lives, from lifestyle choices to genetic predispositions, influence our health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="m7mJIol9S7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/i-built-it-to-break-the-rules-mit-students-pocket-sized-3d-printer-creates-complex-objects-in-just-seconds/"&gt;“I Built It to Break the Rules”: MIT Student’s Pocket-Sized 3D Printer Creates Complex Objects in Just Seconds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over 1,300 peer-reviewed scientific papers already published based on this data, the UK Biobank has set a new standard for medical research. The rapid analysis of heart scans in under a second is just one example of the technological advancements made possible by this dataset. The ability to see inside the human body &lt;i&gt;“in ways that were previously impossible”&lt;/i&gt; opens new avenues for research, enabling scientists to make connections that can lead to new diagnostics and therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Role of Volunteers and Continuous Advancements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central to the success of the UK Biobank’s imaging project is the role played by its volunteers. These individuals, driven by a desire to contribute to a healthier future, have collectively enabled a dataset of immense value to be compiled. Their commitment has not only enhanced our understanding of disease progression but also provided a foundation for future breakthroughs in medical science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the dataset continues to grow, so too does its potential to transform healthcare. The integration of lifestyle and health data with imaging results creates a comprehensive picture that can inform personalized medicine approaches. The ongoing contributions from these volunteers ensure that the UK Biobank remains a pivotal resource in the quest to unravel the complexities of human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Biobank’s imaging project signifies a monumental stride in medical research, offering insights that promise to revolutionize disease prevention and treatment. As we continue to explore the depths of this dataset, one must wonder: how will these insights shape the future of global healthcare, and what new frontiers will we uncover next?&lt;/p&gt;

Some popular peanut butter brands even boast about their protein content on their labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FRPPVH4ONZGMRFUXDN3N44GRKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11022925/#s0006" target="_blank"&gt;in a report&lt;/a&gt; published in a top sports nutrition journal last year, exercise and sports nutrition scientists cautioned that peanut butter isn’t as high in protein as many people think. The report noted that peanut butter is an “energy dense” food: Ounce for ounce, it has a lot more dietary fat and calories compared with eggs, Greek yogurt, lean meats, chicken breast, beans, fish and other high-protein foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RHASUYW6CJAMPKFTSOMWTRJTYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Peanut butter is certainly nutritious. It contains &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/14/high-fiber-meal-plan/" target="_blank"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, vitamins, minerals and heart-healthy unsaturated fats. But it contains at least twice as many grams of fat as protein. You should consider it a great source of fat, rather than a great source of protein, said Jose Antonio, an author of the report and a professor of health and human performance at Nova Southeastern University in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VME3BIY6YFC25IYWPNMQEPYGDM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If you read the nutrition label on any jar of peanut butter, you will see that it’s mostly fat,” said Antonio, who is also the chief executive of the International Society of Sports Nutrition. “The fat is good for you.

Otherwise, the authors warned, they may be setting themselves up for “unintentional weight gain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TC334XRZABHF3CC7P3T2KLA4HQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Peanut butter is a healthy food, but calories still matter,” Antonio said. “If you want to gain weight, eat a bunch of peanut butter.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;After about age 40, our brains begin to lose a step or two.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Each year, our reaction time slows by a few thousandths of a second. We're also less able to recall items on a shopping list.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those changes can be signs of a disease, like Alzheimer's. But usually, they're not.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Both of those things, memory and processing speed, change with age in a normal group of people," says &lt;a href="https://www.tgen.org/faculty-profiles/matt-huentelman/" target="_blank"&gt;Matt Huentelman&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at TGen, the Translational Genomics Research Institute, in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Huentelman should know. He helps run &lt;a href="https://mindcrowd.org/" target="_blank"&gt;MindCrowd&lt;/a&gt;, a free online cognitive test that has been taken by more than 700,000 adults.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;About a thousand of those people had test scores indicating that their brain was "exceptional," meaning they performed like a person 30 years younger on tests of memory and processing speed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Genetics played a role, of course. But Huentelman and a team of researchers have been focusing on other differences.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"We want to study these exceptional performers because we think they can tell us what the rest of us should be doing," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Early results suggest that sleep and maintaining cardiovascular health are a good start. Other &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;measures&lt;/a&gt; include avoiding smoking, limiting alcohol and getting plenty of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huentelman was one of several dozen researchers who met in Miami this summer to discuss healthy brain aging. The event was hosted by the &lt;a href="https://mcknightbrain.org/" target="_blank"&gt;McKnight Brain Research Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, which funds studies on age-related cognitive decline and memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To preserve cognitive function in later life, "we're going to have to understand [brain] aging at a mechanistic level," says &lt;a href="https://mcknightbrain.org/the-mcknight-brain-research-foundation-announces-alice-luo-clayton-phd-as-chief-executive-officer/" target="_blank"&gt;Alice Luo Clayton&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist who is the group's chief executive officer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Another speaker was &lt;a href="https://mbi-umiami.org/lab-member/christian-agudelo-md/" target="_blank"&gt;Christian Agudelo&lt;/a&gt;, a sleep neurologist at the University of Miami's Evelyn F. McKnight Brain Institute.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think the value of sleep and sleep deprivation became true to me when I had kids," Agudelo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those kids are 4 and 6 now, so Agudelo is getting more sleep. But his own experience is consistent with his &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12250" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on the relationship between sleep and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"The better you sleep, the better your brain health is going to be both structurally and functionally," Agudelo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind: Better sleep isn't just about getting more sleep.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The key is getting high-quality sleep, which allows the brain to cycle through all the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526132/" target="_blank"&gt;sleep stages&lt;/a&gt;, Agudelo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers can measure how well a person is sleeping by monitoring their brain wave patterns. But people usually know when they've had a good night's rest, Agudelo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You go to sleep, you wake up and you feel like that experience was worthwhile," he says. "You feel refreshed."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Ensuring high-quality sleep is tricky. But people can improve the odds with certain behaviors, Agudelo says&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Waking up at the same time every single day and aligning our sleep rhythms with the rhythm of the sun" can lead to better sleep, he says. So can "being active, both socially and physically."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those behaviors increase "sleep pressure," the body's natural desire to sleep the longer we are awake, Agudelo says. When that pressure is high, he says, "we can fall asleep more easily and deeply."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Brain aging is also influenced by vascular risk factors, like blood pressure, cholesterol levels and diabetes, says &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/medical-center/team/639/charles-decarli---neurology---dementia---alzheimer-s-disease-sacramento/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles DeCarli&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist who co-directs the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the University of California, Davis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People know that these risk factors usually contribute to medical conditions like heart attack or stroke, DeCarli says. But &lt;a href="https://diversevcid.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on thousands of people 65 and older has found that these risk factors can also impact the brain directly — even if they don't cause a heart attack or other cardiovascular problems.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The size of the brain, the shape of the brain, the tissue integrity of the brain looks older in people who have these risk factors than in people who do not have them," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So DeCarli and a team of researchers are studying whether it's possible to protect the brain by aggressively treating conditions that affect the circulatory system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The question is, if you have these diseases and they are well controlled, will you have a younger-looking brain?" he says. "And the answer seems to be yes."&lt;/p&gt;

The factors include not smoking, a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/03/health/mediterranean-diet-shopping-list-printable-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nutritious diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nutritious diet&lt;/a&gt;, regular exercise, a healthy weight, optimal blood pressure, controlled blood sugar and well-managed cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers reviewed 483 studies on the impacts of maximizing Life’s Simple 7 on the health of many different body systems over the course of people’s lives in a meta-analysis published Wednesday in the &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.038566" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of the American Heart Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining ideal levels of at least three of Life’s Simple 7 metrics was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, even if someone had a genetic predisposition, according to the data. And better scores across all of the factors showed benefits in many body systems beyond cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A few years ago, we learned that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/10/health/heart-dementia-risk-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart health and brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart health and brain health&lt;/a&gt; are very closely tied. Through this review, we found that almost every organ system and bodily function also benefits from maintaining the healthy lifestyle behaviors of Life’s Simple 7,” said lead study author Dr. Liliana Aguayo, a research assistant professor at the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing and the Global Diabetes Research Center at Emory University in Atlanta, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were pleasantly surprised to find that Life’s Simple 7 at optimal levels touched every aspect of health, from head to toe. It goes well beyond just cardiovascular health to encompass whole-body health,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Eating plant-based foods can help heart health, said Dr. Nour Makarem of Columbia University. - FG Trade/E+/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It doesn’t take much to see the benefit&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted a systemic review of studies that followed a gold standard approach, said Dr. Nour Makarem, assistant professor of epidemiology and co-leader of the Chronic Disease Unit at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health in New York City. Makarem was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant findings of the research is that a little change makes a big difference when it comes to lifestyle and health, Aguayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study assessed adherence to Life’s Simple 7 using a scale from 0 to 14 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each improvement by 1 point was associated with an 11% decrease in dementia risk, a 6% decreased risk of eye disease, a 23% decreased risk of fatty liver disease, and an 11% decreased risk of chronic kidney disease, Aguayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This means that small changes, for example, moving from obesity to overweight, adding any physical activity even if below recommended levels counted as progress,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the studies showed an adherence to Life’s Simple 7 was associated with maintaining brain and lung function, vision and hearing, and teeth and muscle strength over the course of aging, according to the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The essential 8 steps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies included in the meta-analysis used Life’s Simple 7 to evaluate lifestyle behaviors, but the AHA has since updated the metrics to Life’s Essential 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines are more comprehensive, such as including avoiding secondhand smoke, vaping and nicotine products in the not smoking factor and pointing people to the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/25/health/mediterranean-diet-cancer-prevention-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/27/health/best-diets-heart-aha-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DASH diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt; under the healthy eating metric, Makarem said. DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension; high blood pressure is a major contributor to heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the update added an eighth metric that recognizes the role of sleep in long-term health, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good sleep means seven to nine hours a night for most adults, 10 to 16 hours for children ages 5 and younger, 9 to 12 hours for kids ages 6 to 12, and 8 to 10 hours for adolescents ages 13 to 18, according to the AHA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study confirms that adopting a healthy lifestyle is important to achieve optimal health as well as managing the conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease –– weight, blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar, Aguayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Even adding a little bit of exercise can help. - Oleg Breslavtsev/Moment RF/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Small changes make a big difference&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyday lifestyle choices have a big impact on overall health, and it’s worth it to take steps toward better cardiovascular health, Aguayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key message is that it is never too early or too late to make small, feasible changes,” she said in an email. “Small improvements in diet, physical activity, smoking, or managing risk factors (weight, blood pressure, cholesterol and sugar) can have meaningful benefits, not just for heart health, but for all the body, from head to toe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a heart-healthy diet, Makarem recommends focusing on plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains and consuming lean proteins such as fish. She also recommended limiting processed foods, sodium and sugar-sweetened beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults should engage in 150 minutes of moderate physical activity — like walking, dancing or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/home/the-best-garden-tools?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gardening;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;gardening&lt;/a&gt; — or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity a week, Makarem added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even considering how impactful small changes can be, ideal cardiovascular health is very rare –– with less than 4% of people worldwide meeting the criteria, Aguayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We must do more to support young people, especially women, by making it easier, more affordable, and achievable for all to improve their cardiovascular health,” she added. “Cardiovascular disease is still the number one killer of women.

You’ve probably seen erythritol listed on sodas, protein bars, and even toothpaste. It’s everywhere. Almost zero calories, no sugar spikes, and perfect for keto diets. Sounds like a win, but maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from the &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Colorado Boulder&lt;/a&gt; has cracked open a side of erythritol that few expected. It’s not about weight gain or tooth decay. It’s about what this &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/artificial-sweeteners-erythritol-directly-linked-to-heart-attacks-and-strokes/"&gt;sweetener&lt;/a&gt; does to your brain’s blood vessels that may elevate the risk of a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study adds to the evidence suggesting that non-nutritive sweeteners that have generally been purported to be safe, may not come without negative health consequences,” said Professor Christopher DeSouza, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-artificial-sweeteners"&gt;Understanding artificial sweeteners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners like erythritol have become go-to sugar substitutes for people looking to cut calories or manage blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/erythritol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Erythritol&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, is a sugar alcohol found naturally in some fruits but is typically produced in bulk from corn or wheat starch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It tastes sweet like sugar but has almost zero calories and doesn’t spike blood glucose, making it popular among those with diabetes or on keto diets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike some other sugar alcohols, erythritol usually causes fewer digestive issues because your body absorbs most of it before it reaches the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s not without controversy. Some recent studies, including this one, have raised concerns about potential links between high erythritol levels and cardiovascular issues like heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sweetener-changes-brain-cells"&gt;Sweetener changes brain cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers did not yet test this in people. They went straight to the cells that line your brain’s blood vessels. These cells regulate blood flow, keep inflammation in check, and help prevent clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cells were exposed to erythritol for just three hours. The amount used was equal to what you would get from one sugar-free drink. That was all it took to cause noticeable changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cells got stressed. They flooded with free radicals, also called reactive oxygen species or ROS. These unstable molecules damage proteins, DNA, and cell membranes. In response, antioxidant defenses went up, but not enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was like the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/artificial-sweetener-erythritol-sugar-substitute-linked-to-blood-clots-heart-disease/"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; knew they were under attack and tried, unsuccessfully, to defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-vessels-started-misbehaving"&gt;Blood vessels started misbehaving&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same short exposure changed how the cells produced nitric oxide, a molecule that helps blood vessels relax. Less nitric oxide means tighter vessels. That’s bad news when your brain needs steady blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total amount of the enzyme that makes nitric oxide didn’t change much, but its function tanked. It stopped doing its job well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol messed with the enzyme’s activation at two specific sites. One turned down, one cranked up. The result was about 20 percent less nitric oxide production. This sets the stage for constricted &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/nutritionists-reveal-the-surprising-health-benefits-of-maple-syrup-including-less-belly-fat/"&gt;vessels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sweetener-makes-brain-vessels-tighten"&gt;Sweetener makes brain vessels tighten&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same cells started pumping out more &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23139-endothelin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;endothelin-1&lt;/a&gt;, a protein that tells blood vessels to tighten up. Compared to normal cells, the erythritol-exposed ones had a 30 percent increase in ET-1. They also had more of its precursor, Big ET-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a double whammy. First, blood vessels lose their ability to widen. Then, they get signals to squeeze even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Big picture, if your vessels are more constricted and your ability to break down blood clots is lowered, your risk of stroke goes up,” said first author Auburn Berry. “Our research demonstrates not only that, but how erythritol has the potential to increase stroke risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clots-don-t-stand-a-chance"&gt;Clots don’t stand a chance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood clots are tricky. You want your body to stop bleeding when you get a cut. But you also want it to break down unnecessary clots inside vessels. One of the body’s tools for that is tissue-type plasminogen activator, or t-PA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers added thrombin, which mimics a clotting &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-sweetener-can-destroy-some-of-the-most-dangerous-bacteria/"&gt;signal&lt;/a&gt;. Normally, that should have made the cells release more t-PA. In untreated cells, that’s exactly what happened. A nice 25 percent boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In erythritol-treated cells? Nothing. The response was completely muted. Clots form and cells don’t react. That’s the formula for a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study tracked over 4,000 people in the U.S. and Europe. The research team found that those with high blood levels of erythritol had more strokes and heart attacks within three years. This happened across both sexes and regardless of other health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Colorado team didn’t just observe changes. They showed exactly how the sweetener weakens brain vessel cells in ways that match the stroke patterns found in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sweeteners-may-harm-blood-vessels"&gt;Sweeteners may harm blood vessels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeSouza and his team exposed real human brain vessel cells to a typical drink-size dose of erythritol. Many people consume several such servings a day. And unlike some substances, erythritol crosses into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study wasn’t designed to track long-term effects, but it does raise a concern. What happens when those cells face erythritol not just for three hours, but every day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the epidemiological study that inspired our work, and now our cellular findings, we believe it would be prudent for people to monitor their consumption of non-nutrient-sweeteners such as this one,” said DeSouza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 09:26:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE53dzc4LXUwSmlGalJMa0Z0MnE2LUU1aFJCZEIyUXJfMklUQnQ0NWF5bFBlVUdEMDJsTlMxaHdacjhDYjI2VjZYdlFYVDdNZk84TmpxN3VjT3EyRkJsaUhxLVRVY05BZjEySGVsQkxESmZKa1hoQTdneTUwRmp0RUU</guid></item><item><title>对120万儿童的研究发现常用疫苗添加剂没有风险- ScienceAlert | Study of 1.2 Million Children Finds No Risk From Common Vaccine Additive - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxOZmk3V3FrWjJldG15bHlPdUNSSHNZX0dVZVl1YVhJSE95R2dDZWdieDZCaU1aOTRmckJMdkUtX1VQUVpLMjRJLVdaRzNYa00xMEN2R051Z0JBVm10T3BFWC1MWkM4OVUwTm4yVDVRTnpwaDVBTGVJcmhMQ01VZjZ0bnpja0gtc0pYSUxWb2gwdXcxNnZrOVdSRi1CeU9PVUUyd3Jj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A massive, 24-year-long study of more than 1.2 million children provides reassurance to parents around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has found &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; compelling evidence that childhood vaccines lead to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="167987" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;, asthma, or dozens of other chronic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Denmark examined the safety of a specific vaccine ingredient – aluminum salts – which, despite &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.663280"&gt;frequent debunking&lt;/a&gt;, remains a common talking point among vaccine skeptics. &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum"&gt;Clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; have tested their safety extensively, and they've been used in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/basics/explaining-how-vaccines-work.html"&gt;non-live vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for more than 70 years to boost the immune system's response to lower doses of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/is-there-thimerosal-in-vaccines-and-is-it-safe-heres-what-the-science-says?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Is There Thimerosal in Vaccines, And Is It Safe? Here's What The Science Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the salts contain aluminum ions, their chemical properties are quite different to those of pure aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really important for parents to understand that we are not injecting metal into children," epidemiologist and senior author Anders Hviid from Statens Serum Institute in Denmark &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/study-finds-no-link-aluminum-vaccines-autism-asthma-rcna218682"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; NBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study addresses many of these concerns and provides clear and robust evidence for the safety of childhood vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1997 through 2020, Hviid and colleagues tracked the health outcomes of more than 1.2 million Danish children using a nationwide registry containing details on childhood vaccinations, diagnoses, and potential biases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the children were born at a time when fewer vaccines with aluminum salts were recommended. Others grew up when more were recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, a kid's exposure to vaccine-related aluminum salts before age 2 was not significantly related to any of 50 chronic disorders, including 36 autoimmune, 9 allergic, and 5 neurodevelopmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of dose-dependent relationship between aluminum salts and a child's ongoing health strongly suggests the ingredient is safe for use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167990" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167990" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/images_annals2500997ff2_figure_2_early_childhood_vaccination_with_aluminum_adsorbed_vaccines_in-642x468.jpg" alt="Early Childhood Vaccines" class="size-medium wp-image-167990" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/images_annals2500997ff2_figure_2_early_childhood_vaccination_with_aluminum_adsorbed_vaccines_in-642x468.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/images_annals2500997ff2_figure_2_early_childhood_vaccination_with_aluminum_adsorbed_vaccines_in-569x415.jpg 569w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/images_annals2500997ff2_figure_2_early_childhood_vaccination_with_aluminum_adsorbed_vaccines_in-768x560.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/images_annals2500997ff2_figure_2_early_childhood_vaccination_with_aluminum_adsorbed_vaccines_in-600x437.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/images_annals2500997ff2_figure_2_early_childhood_vaccination_with_aluminum_adsorbed_vaccines_in.jpg 870w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167990" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Early childhood vaccination with aluminum-adsorbed vaccines in Denmark from 1997 through 2020.

Whether we realize it or not, the typical adult &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum"&gt;ingests&lt;/a&gt; about 7 to 9 milligrams of aluminum a day in various forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By some estimates, if infants receive all the vaccines they need in the first six months of life, that would amount to about 4.4 mg of aluminum. In that same time frame, breast-fed infants ingest about 7 mg of aluminum, and formula-fed infants ingest about 38 milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When aluminum adjuvants in vaccines are injected into muscle, they enter the bloodstream and are then &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/04/scicheck-posts-raise-unfounded-concerns-about-aluminum-in-vaccines/"&gt;processed&lt;/a&gt; by the kidneys and expelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2017.09.003"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 85 infants, aluminum concentrations in the blood and hair did not increase after receiving a vaccine. This suggests that aluminum concentrations in the body don't accumulate or reach toxic levels after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="167987" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/groups/global-advisory-committee-on-vaccine-safety/topics/adjuvants"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that the level of aluminum after vaccination "never exceeds safe US regulatory thresholds… even for low birth-weight infants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, there is strong evidence to suggest aluminum adjuvants are safe for use in childhood vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, each year, about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-immunization/fast-facts/index.html"&gt;four million deaths&lt;/a&gt; are avoided because of these immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood vaccinations don't threaten children's lives, they save them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The result? Poor focus, memory glitches, and emotional fatigue. I’ve developed five daily habits — used with patients and in my own life — that help restore clarity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen more frazzled, forgetful, foggy patients this year than ever before. Not because they’re sick. Not because they’re old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But because their brains are overstimulated and undernourished in ways we still don’t fully understand. “I forget words mid-sentence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My brain feels like a browser with 78 tabs open.” “Even when I rest, &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/tiny-signs-chronic-fatigue-system"&gt;I feel tired&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These aren’t rare comments. I hear them every day — like the mother of three who told me she forgot her ATM PIN at checkout, or the tech worker who confessed he hasn’t read a full email in months.  From executives. From teachers. From teenagers. This is a clinical reality, not just a vibe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;As a doctor, I’ve come to believe we’re living through a silent cognitive crisis, and that's why everyone's brains feel so broken right now. &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-07/why-everyones-brain-feels-so-broken-right-now.png" alt="woman who's brain feels broken" title="why everyone's brain feels so broken right now" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;CrizzyStudio / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not dementia. Not quite depression. Something subtler — and more pervasive. A kind of neural exhaustion from too many inputs, too few boundaries, and no clear &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/simple-steps-help-you-hit-reset-button-your-life-only-15-minutes"&gt;way to reset&lt;/a&gt;. The science is beginning to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;We’re starting to understand how constant stimulation physically reshapes the brain. We were never built for this.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what I see in the clinic every week: A lawyer tells me he’s making more mistakes in briefs than ever before. A college student describes &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/people-who-suddenly-lose-interest-everyone-around-them-often-have-these-reasons"&gt;losing interest in everything&lt;/a&gt;, even her favorite books. A nurse forgets common medication names during shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of them is sick. All of them are overwhelmed. And it’s not just mental. It’s physical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their nervous systems are stuck in a mild but constant state of fight-or-flight. Their pulse is up. Their sleep is down. And their minds can’t seem to slow down, even when their bodies try. We weren’t built for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/people-maintain-discipline-say-no-without-feeling-guilty-have-these-strengths"&gt;People Who Maintain The Discipline To Say No Without Feeling Guilty Have These 5 Strengths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your brain doesn't work in modern life. In medical terms, here’s what we think is happening: Brain scans now reveal that chronic overstimulation — including scrolling, alerts, newsfeeds, and multitasking — shrinks the prefrontal cortex, heightens stress pathways, and overwhelms the brain with noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortisol overdrive:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/subtle-ways-stress-completely-messes-up-your-life"&gt;Chronic stress&lt;/a&gt;, even mild, keeps the stress hormone cortisol elevated, leading to memory impairment and mood instability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Default Mode Network disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain’s Default Mode Network (DMN) — active during rest and introspection — supports creativity, memory, and self-awareness. But constant task-switching and alerts suppress DMN activity, preventing the brain from entering deeper states of reflection and consolidation. Harvard and UC studies suggest this disruption may reduce creative insight and cognitive resilience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine dysregulation:&lt;/strong&gt; Constant hits of novelty (social media, texts, headlines) mess with our motivation system. What used to feel rewarding — a walk, a conversation — feels dull by comparison.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/productive-people-avoid-these-things-like-plague"&gt;The Top 1% Of Productive People Avoid These 8 Things Like The Plague&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result: A pervasive sense that we’re always behind, always distracted, and never really resting. Here are the five strategies I recommend most often. Not supplements. Not brain games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Here are five simple, evidence-backed tools that help reset the brain and make it feel less broken:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Start your day with a light, not a screen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunlight (or a 10,000 lux lamp) within 30 minutes of waking boosts alertness, mood, and circadian rhythm regulation. Scrolling does the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Protect at least one “deep work” block&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even 45 minutes a day of uninterrupted focus, with no pings or multitasking, can &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-laser-focused-people-do-stay-on-task-finish-stuff"&gt;rebuild attention networks&lt;/a&gt; over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Reclaim boredom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let yourself do nothing — no phone, no podcast, no input — for 5–10 minutes a day. This reactivates the Default Mode Network (DMN), the brain’s system for creativity, memory, and self-reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DMN becomes active when you’re not focused on external tasks — during rest, daydreaming, or mind-wandering. Doing nothing — especially without digital stimulation — helps engage this network, supporting:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creativity&lt;/strong&gt; (idea generation, divergent thinking)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autobiographical memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future planning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem-solving&lt;/strong&gt; rooted in personal experience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/health-wellness/everyday-habits-can-damage-your-brain-according-research"&gt;11 Everyday Habits That Can Damage Your Brain, According To Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Use your eyes to calm the mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lateral eye movement — like looking side to side while walking outdoors or deliberately scanning the horizon — activates the parasympathetic system and reduces stress. Even 5 minutes of this, especially in nature, can lower heart rate and improve focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Schedule a daily digital reset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose a fixed time (even 20 minutes) when all devices go off. Treat it like a prescription. This single boundary can lower anxiety and help your brain transition from reaction to reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One patient — a 39-year-old software project manager — implemented all five of these habits over a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Day 4, her headaches stopped. By Day 6, she told me her memory had “snapped back.” By Day 7, she had read a book cover to cover for the first time in two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t magic. It’s neurology. A week of &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/plant-habits-now-enjoy-good-life-years-to-come"&gt;intentional habits&lt;/a&gt; can change how your brain feels and functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;If your brain feels broken lately, it’s not a personal failure — it’s a system failure. &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are living in a world designed to fracture our attention and monetize our exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you can push back.

          &lt;p&gt;A sweeping analysis of health data from more than 1.2 million children in Denmark born over a 24-year period found no link between the small amounts of aluminum in vaccines and a wide range of health conditions—including asthma, allergies, eczema, autism, and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finding, &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997"&gt;published in the Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, firmly squashes a persistent anti-vaccine talking point that can give vaccine-hesitant parents pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small amounts of aluminum salts have been added to vaccines for decades as adjuvants, that is, components of the vaccine that help drum up protective immune responses against a target germ. Aluminum adjuvants can be found in a variety of vaccines, including those against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, &lt;em&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/em&gt; type b (Hib), and hepatitis A and B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of use worldwide and no clear link to harms, concern about aluminum and cumulative exposures continually resurfaces—largely thanks to anti-vaccine advocates who fearmonger about the element. A leader of such voices is Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the current US health secretary and an ardent anti-vaccine advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/p6LJXPOv4SM?t=3885"&gt;a June 2024 interview with podcaster Joe Rogan&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy falsely claimed that aluminum is "extremely neurotoxic" and "give[s] you allergies." The podcast has racked up nearly 2 million views on YouTube. Likewise, Children's Health Defense, the rabid anti-vaccine organization &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/robert-f-kennedy-jr-announces-the-launch-of-childrens-health-defense-300710874.html"&gt;Kennedy created in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, has also made &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/search/?search=aluminum"&gt;wild claims about the safety of aluminum adjuvants&lt;/a&gt;. That includes linking it to &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/high-aluminum-found-autism-brain-tissue/"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;, despite that &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/wp-content/uploads/catg.d/p4026.pdf"&gt;many high-quality scientific studies&lt;/a&gt; have found &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2908388/"&gt;no link&lt;/a&gt; between any vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While anti-vaccine advocates like Kennedy routinely dismiss and attack the plethora of studies that do not support their dangerous claims, the new study should reassure any hesitant parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clear data, unclear future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the study, lead author Niklas Worm Andersson, of the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, and colleagues tapped into Denmark's national registry to analyze medical records of over 1.2 million children born in the country between 1997 and 2018. During that time, new vaccines were introduced and recommendations shifted, creating variation in how many aluminum-containing vaccines children received.&lt;/p&gt;

But new research from Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University suggests this long-standing advice may be outdated — and unnecessarily costly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="O47LVBCYVNBDZIZGAPBXXQFJ54"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/cmr.00031-25" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;study published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, OHSU scientists argue that adults who completed their childhood vaccinations may not need tetanus or diphtheria boosters nearly as often as previously thought. Their findings suggest protection lasts far longer for most healthy adults — at least 30 years, and possibly for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SRHNCEKEWZC6JC7PXTOKXFOG54"&gt;“Why keep vaccinating adults every 10 years?

But Slifka said this guidance hasn’t kept pace with mounting evidence that immunity to these diseases — now rare in the U.S. thanks to widespread childhood vaccination — doesn’t require such frequent upkeep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ASLTSYTDFZGRLMBO3424BK6B7E"&gt;“Tetanus and diphtheria are among our most successful vaccines,” he said. “Their effectiveness has virtually eliminated these diseases in countries with high childhood vaccination coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TUONDJ2BZNFNHPSGTKAHHRMOEM"&gt;Tetanus, a severe bacterial disease caused by spores commonly found in soil, manure or dust, now occurs in the U.S. at a rate of less than one case per 10 million people annually.

His findings suggest that for adults who received the standard five-dose childhood vaccine series, immunity often lasts for life — making routine boosters largely unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:VFGBCU7HQRBXJE7QU65XVOPECQ" data-fusion-component="VFGBCU7HQRBXJE7QU65XVOPECQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:VFGBCU7HQRBXJE7QU65XVOPECQ" data-fusion-component="VFGBCU7HQRBXJE7QU65XVOPECQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VUC5ZPJWE5F2RC3UH2MZYDOBGU"&gt;Based on the evidence, the researchers propose a simpler, age-based schedule: a booster at age 30 and another at 60. They say that would eliminate the confusion and burden of trying to recall the date of one’s last shot every decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UBBCDABNSNDS5KLXJTNCDTPLDQ"&gt;Slifka said “this idea isn’t a radical change,” as similar policies exist abroad. The United Kingdom, for example, doesn’t recommend routine adult boosters and has maintained low rates of both diseases, even during a 2022 influx of more than 70 diphtheria cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="X7HRTR64UFHVFHAKUGYPQ7WZQY"&gt;The World Health Organization dropped its recommendation for routine adult boosters in 2017, advising them only in specific circumstances such as pregnancy, travel, or wound care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YXBKNZR7OFGPROTROSIIYEJOGQ"&gt;Meanwhile, more than 18 million Americans receive these boosters annually, costing over $1 billion. The researchers say a 30-year schedule could cut vaccination costs by two-thirds, saving around $280 million each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Z6BHZSGDDFHGRNXU7STUBR57FM"&gt;Slifka said eliminating unnecessary boosters — while continuing vaccinations for pregnant women, people with wounds and those with uncertain vaccine history — could free up resources for other public health priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MUZ57AU4YZFFRJCILXMYT2HDBQ"&gt;“If we could use some of these funds that we save and use it to deal with vaccine hesitancy and vaccine education, then I think we could really put that money to good use,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5RNOZUYBLZGJTDA3TWO5NWBIZI"&gt;Slifka said that while the study suggests boosters may not be needed as often, it should not be seen as a reason to overlook the importance of childhood vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5GTW3OYJ55H3BHXPDS6WQBEV2M"&gt;“Vaccines work, and they work for a long time,” he said. “By maintaining strong, consistent childhood vaccination programs, we’re able to reduce or eliminate these booster vaccinations for adults.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BKSRW2T5OFDHBJYHC7XJCB2QKU"&gt;Changes to official guidelines would require review by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the group responsible for setting vaccine policy in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OY5KBOME3JHXNMCCDACSSK4ZBE"&gt;Slifka hopes this new evidence sparks a fresh look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QMFPSIIFIRFWZMUB7RZHSFKOGM"&gt;“The wheels of science turn slowly,” he said. “But we think it’s time to bring this back up for discussion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20" data-gaid="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--center skimlinks"&gt;If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.&lt;span&gt; By using this site, you consent to our &lt;a href="https://www.advancelocal.com/advancelocalUserAgreement/user-agreement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;User Agreement&lt;/a&gt; and agree that your clicks, interactions, and personal information may be collected, recorded, and/or stored by us and social media and other third-party partners in accordance with our &lt;a href="https://www.advancelocal.com/advancelocalUserAgreement/privacy-policy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Privacy Policy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>OregonLive.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 21:43:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>PHMDC在药物过量服用增加后发布公共卫生警报- Channel 3000 | PHMDC issues public health alert after increase in drug overdoses - Channel 3000</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4gFBVV95cUxOelB2cVNMS0dINmNnWThXZ3ZnY1otcE1VaW1kNjBKakk2MDVVc0xZTDNZZTQzaDYwZmhrR3czcElWd0k1UUJ2QTR0VEwwUGs3ZFlUbGY3R1MyNWZITWVVc3BuVjZGU1FYLTBTUnBKM2RKeEFfcDdBWFZlaHlLMmM2UG1nd0ZCLUppUGZaVXp6NnM0UmNqRF81WHJ0NXE2d3pNQUhxR1F1UHR0QW9fNVRoUXJlb0VrNHFwaEYtcDlscHdpRm54MFduTXV6aU5OT1Bjbnl1UTUyTjI1RVVVTDVack5n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;MADISON, Wis. -- Public Health Madison &amp;amp; Dane County issued a public health alert on Tuesday due to an increase in drug overdoses in Dane County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHMDC reported the alert is based on data from hospitals and EMS providers. Within 24 hours, July 13 to July 14, there were five confirmed overdose response calls from EMS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unknown what is driving this spike. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Drug use during the summer months can also increase the risk of heat-related illnesses, like heat stroke and dehydration." "This is because certain types of drugs raise core body temperature and interfere with the body’s ability to regulate temperature,” said Public Health Supervisor Julia Olson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or someone you know is using drugs, PHMDC gave the following tips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=misAs9xKO8s" target="_blank"&gt;Know the signs of an overdose:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pale, sweaty or clammy skin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lips/fingertips turn blue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slow or irregular breathing: gasping, gurgling, or snoring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficult or unable to wake&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always call 911 if you think someone is overdosing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t use street drugs alone; call Never Use Alone at 800-484-3731&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Check in with your friends/family who use drugs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Test all drugs for fentanyl before using&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carry Narcan® (naloxone) and be prepared to use multiple doses when needed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get safer use supplies, like fentanyl test strips and Narcan®, from the Syringe Services Program at Public Health Madison &amp;amp; Dane County: 2705 E. Washington Ave. or 2300 S. Park St. in Madison&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact the Behavioral Health Resource Center of Dane County for treatment and recovery resources: (608) 267-2244&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Share this alert with others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;​COPYRIGHT 2025 BY CHANNEL 3000.

Scientists found that older musicians showed more efficient brain connectivity and better performance than non-musicians of the same age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that musical training builds cognitive reserve, preserving brain networks and reducing the need for age-related compensatory mechanisms. The findings support the idea that positive lifestyle choices like learning music can mitigate age-related cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Older musicians outperformed peers on speech-in-noise tasks, with more youthful brain connectivity patterns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Functional MRI showed that musical training preserved the integrity of auditory and motor brain networks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The study supports the “Hold-Back Upregulation” hypothesis: cognitive reserve maintains brain efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-term musical training may mitigate the age-related decline in speech perception by enhancing cognitive reserve, according to a study published July 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology &lt;/em&gt;by Claude Alain from the Baycrest Academy for Research and Education, Canada, and Yi Du from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal aging is typically associated with declines in sensory and cognitive functions. These age-related changes in perception and cognition are often accompanied by increased neural activity and functional connectivity – the statistical dependence of activity between different brain regions – in widely distributed neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111656"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older man playing piano and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;As predicted, the results revealed reduced age-related declines in speech-in-noise performance among older musicians compared to older non-musicians.  Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recruitment of neural activity and strengthening of functional connectivity are thought to reflect a compensatory strategy employed by older adults to maintain optimal cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive lifestyle choices, such as musical training, higher levels of education, and bilingualism, contribute to cognitive and brain reserve, which represents the accumulation of cognitive and neural resources before the onset of age-related brain changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive Reserve Theory suggests that this reserve accrued through experience and training can help mitigate the impact of age-related brain decline, leading to better-than-expected cognitive performance. Yet how cumulative reserves influenced by positive lifestyle factors affect neural activity in older populations remains controversial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this question, the researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity in 25 older musicians, 25 older non-musicians, and 24 young non-musicians who were asked to identify syllables masked by noise sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused their analysis on neural responses within the auditory dorsal stream, which includes auditory, inferior parietal, dorsal frontal motor, and frontal motor areas, supporting sound-to-action mapping and sensorimotor integration during speech processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As predicted, the results revealed reduced age-related declines in speech-in-noise performance among older musicians compared to older non-musicians. During speech-in-noise perception, the older non-musicians showed the typical age-related compensatory increase in functional connectivity in auditory dorsal streams bilaterally (i.e., in both hemispheres of the brain).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, older musicians exhibited a connectivity pattern in bilateral auditory dorsal streams that resembled young non-musicians, with connectivity strength in the right dorsal stream correlating with speech-in-noise perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, older musicians exhibited more youth-like spatial pattern of functional connectivity during the task, whereas older non-musicians consistently showed a spatial pattern that deviated from young non-musicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings support the “Hold-Back Upregulation” hypothesis, which posits that cognitive reserve from musical training promotes a more youthful functional connectivity pattern, leading to superior behavioral outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond merely compensating for age-related declines, cognitive reserve may work by maintaining the integrity and functional architecture of neural networks, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of aging on cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But due to the study design, it was not possible to determine cause-and-effect relationships between musical training and performance in the perception task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, future studies should further test the “Hold-Back Upregulation” hypothesis using different cognitive tasks, such as memory and attention tasks, and investigate other sources of reserve, such as physical exercise and bilingualism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, these findings may inform interventions aimed at preserving cognitive function and improving communication outcomes in aging populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lei Zhang adds, “A positive lifestyle helps older adults cope better with cognitive ageing, and it is never too late to take up, and stick with, a rewarding hobby such as learning an instrument.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Yi Du adds, “Just like a well-tuned instrument doesn’t need to be played louder to be heard, the brains of older musicians stay finely tuned thanks to years of training. Our study shows that this musical experience builds cognitive reserve, helping their brains avoid the usual age-related overexertion when trying to understand speech in noisy places.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by STI 2030—Major Project (2021ZD0201500, https://service.most.gov.cn/) to YD, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (RGPIN-2021-02721, https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp) to CA, and Canadian Institute for Health Research (PJT 183614, https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/193.html) to CA.

Cognitive reserve accrued from positive life choices like long-term musical training can provide additional neural resources to help cope with the effect of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the relationship between cognitive reserve and upregulated neural activity in older adults remains poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a speech-in-noise task and assessed whether cognitive reserve accumulated from long-term musical training bolsters or holds back age-related increase in neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older musicians exhibited less upregulation of task-induced functional connectivity than older non-musicians in auditory dorsal regions, which predicted better behavioral performance in older musicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, older musicians demonstrated more youth-like spatial patterns of functional connectivity, as compared to older non-musicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings show that cognitive reserve accrued through long-term music training holds back age-related neural recruitment during speech-in-noise perception and enlighten the intricate interplay between cognitive reserve and age-related upregulated activity during cognitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 19:48:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5NM2Z1Rm9YanF4TTU2Q2lJWnJteXl3cmdoamFSRlJyVGw5UzNoUnNSYXoxd1EzdDVPZE80anRnQ1RsQmlyMFl0dWtfcE5UTEZOWm9QRGROa1FVWXVNUUZmRG1hUWprX3JWdmpNUUtYZER4c0E</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.的牙齿怎么了？ - Slate Magazine | What’s Going On With RFK Jr.’s Teeth? - Slate Magazine</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxNZjFRbXhwWUxsbWt3SHZQeWlJSW1SdDlpbHhhRFYwZXI3dkVIRE9URzdFNm05YzBLcnZBYmZzbU5IWDcxdlBDX3pvcDEwTEpIa1NCdlNVbHlxdEdTTUhjcktHX0FURURXbjdVcGNpWmRGdE4wSHhpUkdWdVkzck9NYUxwOXFNQkswSXRnUjQzUTM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4t27hd00691dktf9c9yw1w@published"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the United States secretary of health and human services, has some strong opinions about teeth. Specifically, he seems to kind of hate fluoride, a mineral that, when added to the public drinking water in small amounts, can prevent dental decay. Despite what Kennedy claims, there are &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/01/fluoride-childrens-iq-study-pregnancy-science.html"&gt;no proven negative side effects&lt;/a&gt; of doing this. So far this year, Utah and Florida have banned fluoride in their drinking water, and a &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/05/16/fluoride-bans-states-florida-utah/83667361007/"&gt;slew of other states&lt;/a&gt; are considering doing the same. Without fluoride in the water, “you’re going to see probably slightly more cavities,” RFK Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/06/27/rfk-jr-fluoride-more-cavities-balance/84382999007/"&gt;recently admitted&lt;/a&gt; on Fox News.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpk001j3b775jw5nlhe@published"&gt;That cavalier attitude about a rise in cavities has upset a lot of dentists. Cavities aren’t trivial—they can result in a lot of pain. “Dental decay is a &lt;em&gt;disease&lt;/em&gt;,” Barry Taylor, executive director of Oregon Dental Association, told me. “Essentially, he’s saying: There will be more disease.” The American Dental Association “is very concerned for people of all ages and socioeconomic status” in communities stopping water fluoridation, a spokesperson wrote in an email. “People who suffer from untreated dental disease miss millions of school and work hours,” they added. So far, RFK Jr. is not looking great for America’s teeth.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpk001k3b77vzuh0y04@published"&gt;When Slate saw the above not-so-flattering image in a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/insurers-wont-say-if-theyll-pay-for-childhood-vaccines-dropped-from-recommended-schedule/"&gt;recent Wired article&lt;/a&gt;, we had to wonder, &lt;a href="https://www.threads.com/@nicmonsees/post/DLnVWcwzJdA/what-is-even-happening-here-with-rfk-jrs-teeth-and-gums"&gt;as others&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/1lppwoz/what_the_hell_is_happening_in_rfk_jrs_mouth/"&gt;did&lt;/a&gt;, if Kennedy is not great for his &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; teeth. His mouth looks a little … grimy. Is it possible the man is against not just fluoride but also toothbrushes and floss? I called up a few dentists to see what they might make of his incisors. (Here, I’ll state the requisite caveat: It’s impossible to diagnose from a single photo and without a full dental workup.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpl001l3b772tc71rb3@published"&gt;There’s a lot to unpack. “The first thought is, he needs to brush his teeth,” Taylor said. “It may just be a picture that was taken after lunch, and he has a piece of Windsor clam or something in there, I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="128" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpl001m3b77kaq4e30p@published"&gt;Other dentists were less sure about the wad of yellowish stuff stuck between his left front tooth and the tooth next to it. When I showed the picture to my own dentist, he thought it looked most like calculus—hardened plaque—though, he said, that usually forms across multiple teeth. Arosha Weerakoon, a professor in dentistry at the University of Queensland, in Australia, suggested that it could be something called Valplast, a type of flexible denture—perhaps that front tooth of his is fake. Though the consensus was that most if not all of RFK Jr.’s teeth look as if they are probably real, which is “pretty big for that age,” my dentist noted. (Kennedy is 71 years old, and most people have replaced at least a few teeth by then.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="141" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpl001n3b77tf2lmlcv@published"&gt;He got high marks for his gums too. There’s some darkening at the point where tooth meets gum, which indicates recession. But that happens naturally with aging, Weerakoon said, and at a glance, the extent of RFK Jr.’s recession appears to be in line with what you might expect at 71. Notably, his gums aren’t puffy, which would indicate gum disease. (Another controversial figure who likely &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have gum disease: Elon Musk. &lt;a href="https://dentalwiseturkey.com/elon-musk-teeth/"&gt;That puffy part by his front tooth&lt;/a&gt;? “It’s severely inflamed,” Weerakoon said. A slight touch to that area while speaking or eating, and “that’d be bleeding everywhere.”) Gum disease is &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21482-gum-periodontal-disease"&gt;most often caused by the buildup of plaque&lt;/a&gt;, which consists of bacteria that can infect the gums. Oral hygiene—especially brushing and flossing—is important to prevent gum disease. So Kennedy’s nice gums suggest that he may, generally, be a flosser.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpm001o3b77ysdxu7lv@published"&gt;There’s also the matter of the white strip on his top gum. Taylor suggested that it could be medical tape used to cover a surgical site. Weerakoon asked her dentist friends about it, and they came to a different conclusion: “It’s a Zyn.” That’s also what my own dentist thought. A friend and extracurricular Zyn expert whom I checked with concurred that it looks identical to the nicotine pouch that people push into their gums. It aligns, too, with public speculation back in January that RFK Jr. &lt;a href="https://people.com/rfk-jr-speculation-nicotine-pouch-confirmation-hearing-8783718"&gt;popped a Zyn&lt;/a&gt; during a confirmation hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpm001p3b77v01xq99j@published"&gt;Taken together, while the average person might recoil from this pic, it’s not damning of Kennedy’s dental hygiene. “If I was at a cocktail party, I’d be thinking, ‘decent teeth,’ ” said Taylor. “Just from that one picture, it appears that he has had good dental care in his life.” But what about the discoloring? Weerakoon notes that the slight difference between the two left teeth is likely due to a knock on the left tooth, which could have killed the tooth’s nerve. (I have the misfortune of an identical discoloring on the same exact tooth due to a slip on a rock.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="144" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpm001q3b77ax38ympe@published"&gt;The rest of the yellowing is a sign not of bad hygiene but of natural teeth “within a range of normal for that age,” Taylor said. All teeth yellow with time, and no amount of brushing and mouthwash can fix that—you’d have to have veneers or get bleach treatments, common choices for many Americans, particularly those in the &lt;a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2004/07/what-nice-teeth-the-democrats-have.html"&gt;public eye&lt;/a&gt;. Veneers are &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/why-does-everyone-in-hollywood-have-veneers-now"&gt;a norm in Hollywood now&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s even &lt;a href="https://www.hiltonheadcosmeticdentist.com/president-trump-wear-porcelain-veneers/"&gt;speculation&lt;/a&gt; that Donald Trump’s too-perfect teeth &lt;a href="https://www.bhdentists.com/blog/donald-trumps-smile-care-secrets/"&gt;are actually veneers&lt;/a&gt;. The interesting truth is that teeth don’t have to necessarily &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; good to be in good condition—in fact, natural teeth will almost certainly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; look “good” (i.e., white, spot-free, straight). So here I might throw RFK Jr. a bone: He’s not feeling any sort of pressure for his teeth to perfectly look the part. You could even say he’s helping to redefine dental beauty standards.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpm001r3b77c3a0zl5d@published"&gt;The fact that RFK Jr.’s teeth are largely in dentist-approved shape, though, is really the point. Although the fluoridation of public water that he opposes can benefit everyone, it’s consistently found to be most beneficial to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2834515"&gt;people with low incomes or who live in rural areas&lt;/a&gt;. There are other ways to get fluoride: toothpaste with fluoride or a professional fluoride treatment at your dentist’s office. And there are other important steps to keep your teeth in good shape and fight cavities: eating a healthy diet, brushing and flossing, regularly visiting the dentist. But all of these options require a certain level of access to resources, money, time, and health education.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="65" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpn001s3b77i61q9mp2@published"&gt;“RFK can afford any dentist anytime he wants to,” said Weerakoon. “So he can afford to go without water fluoridation.” For those who aren’t as fortunate, fluoridation is a great, inexpensive option to reduce cavities among all populations; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has given the process the distinction of being “&lt;a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/pcd/2015/04/23/community-water-fluoridation-one-of-the-10-greatest-public-health-achievements-of-the-20th-century/"&gt;one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpn001t3b77mnp979qy@published"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2834515"&gt;recent study projected&lt;/a&gt; that complete fluoridation removal from drinking water in the U.S. would lead to an increase of roughly 25.4 million cases of decayed teeth in children and cost approximately $9.8 billion over five years in health care expenses. Low-income communities will be hardest hit. Dental disease isn’t just a cavity here and there. It can cause millions of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/school-health-conditions/chronic/oral-health.html"&gt;missed school days&lt;/a&gt; among children; cost someone a job or create significant quality-of-life challenges due to social stigma; and, some research suggests, even result in complications such as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/dental/art-20047475#:~:text=Some%20research%20suggests%20that%20heart,birth%20and%20low%20birth%20weight"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpn001u3b774t6aqse1@published"&gt;Kids, who cannot go out and buy fluoride toothpaste for themselves, will be particularly harmed by RFK Jr.’s anti-fluoride crusade. Weerakoon saw firsthand what could become more common in the States when working at a &lt;a href="https://www.health.qld.gov.au/public-health/industry-environment/environment-land-water/water/fluoridation"&gt;school in Queensland&lt;/a&gt; where many children were not drinking fluoridated water. She had a 4-year-old patient with so many holes in his teeth that he had to have all them removed. And yet, tooth decay &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/oral-health"&gt;is largely preventable&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re protecting those who are most vulnerable,” Weerakoon said, “that don’t have an opportunity to help &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;themselves.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;For generations, chicken soup has been &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002067.htm"&gt;a go-to remedy&lt;/a&gt; for people feeling under the weather. It holds a cherished place in many cultures as a comforting treatment for colds and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="167855" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is there any real science behind the idea that soup can help us recover from respiratory infections?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside colleagues, I conducted a &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/13/2247"&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; to explore this question, which examined the scientific evidence on the role of soup in managing acute respiratory tract infections, such as the common cold,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="167855" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="167855" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of more than 10,000 records, we identified four high-quality studies involving 342 participants. These studies tested a variety of soups, including &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/does-chicken-soup-really-help-when-youre-sick-a-nutrition-specialist-explains-whats-behind-the-beloved-comfort-food-213847"&gt;traditional chicken broth&lt;/a&gt;, barley soup, and herbal vegetable blends. While still early-stage, the evidence was promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chicken-soup-has-been-a-remedy-for-thousands-of-years-but-why?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Chicken Soup Has Been a Remedy For Thousands of Years… But Why?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9391229/"&gt;One study found&lt;/a&gt; that people who ate soup recovered up to 2.5 days faster than those who didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms such as nasal congestion, sore throat and fatigue were milder. Some participants also showed reduced levels of &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/ageing-isnt-the-same-everywhere-why-inflammation-may-be-a-lifestyle-problem-260322"&gt;inflammation-related&lt;/a&gt; markers: substances in the blood that rise when the immune system is fighting an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, levels of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4176007/"&gt;IL-6&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha"&gt;TNF-α&lt;/a&gt; – two proteins that help trigger inflammation – were lower in those who consumed soup. This suggests that soup may help calm an overactive immune response, potentially making symptoms less severe and recovery more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, none of the studies examined how consuming soup influenced everyday outcomes of acute respiratory tract infections, such as whether people took fewer days off work or were less likely to end up in hospital. That's a major gap in the evidence, and one that future research needs to address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/can-chicken-soup-really-cure-body-and-soul-52357"&gt;are several reasons soup&lt;/a&gt; may help. It's warm, hydrating and &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/is-soup-healthy"&gt;typically nutrient-rich&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ingredients like garlic, onion, ginger and leafy greens have &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4267963/"&gt;anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7402177/"&gt;antimicrobial&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8389214/"&gt;immune-supportive&lt;/a&gt; properties. The warmth can also help loosen mucus, soothe sore throats and promote overall comfort during illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167894" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167894" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/soup_when_sick_642.jpg" alt="woman eating soup" class="wp-image-167894 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/soup_when_sick_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/soup_when_sick_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167894" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ancient wisdom sometimes persists for good reason. (GoodLifeStudio/Getty Images Signature/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Not just nourishment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also a strong cultural and behavioral aspect to food-based self-care: when people use food not just for nourishment, but as an intentional part of managing illness and promoting recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many households, food becomes medicine not only because of its ingredients, but because it symbolizes care, routine and reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My previous research found that &lt;a href="https://www.dovepress.com/parent-use-of-complementary-medicine-remedies-and-services-for-the-man-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-JMDH"&gt;parents, in particular&lt;/a&gt; often &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1744388120301900?via%3Dihub"&gt;turn to traditional remedies&lt;/a&gt;, like soup, as a first line of defense when illness strikes, often well before seeking professional medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reflects &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229917309056?via%3Dihub"&gt;a growing interest in home remedies&lt;/a&gt; and the importance of culturally familiar treatments: remedies that feel safe, trusted and emotionally resonant because they're part of a person's upbringing or community norms. These kinds of treatments can increase confidence and comfort when self-managing illness at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food-based self-care may become increasingly important as pressure on healthcare systems continues to grow. With rising concerns about &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance"&gt;antimicrobial resistance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/33/11/738"&gt;overstretched services&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.576229/full"&gt;lingering trauma from global pandemics&lt;/a&gt;, simple, evidence-informed home treatments can play a crucial role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They help people manage mild illness, reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and avoid placing additional strain on GPs or &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/dec/31/big-rise-in-people-going-to-ae-in-england-for-minor-ailments-data-shows"&gt;emergency departments for minor ailments&lt;/a&gt; that can be safely treated at home. Even a simple phone &lt;a href="https://www.gponline.com/simple-phone-message-common-cold-cuts-gp-appointment-waits-21/article/1581517"&gt;message about the common cold&lt;/a&gt; – "Most common colds get better in a few days and don't need treatment from your GP" – has been shown to reduce appointment demand by 21 percent, highlighting how low-cost, home-based care could ease pressure across the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Local Government Association (LGA) &lt;a href="https://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/22.32%20-%20Self%20Care%20Publication_02.1_1WEB.pdf"&gt;reports that&lt;/a&gt; GPs handle approximately 57 million cases of minor conditions such as coughs and colds annually, costing the NHS over £2 billion a year. &lt;a href="https://www.local.gov.uk/topics/social-care-health-and-integration/role-councils-promoting-self-care"&gt;It argues that&lt;/a&gt; educating people about &lt;a href="https://www.pagb.co.uk/content/uploads/2024/01/PAGB-Self-Care-Survey-2023.pdf"&gt;effective self-care&lt;/a&gt; could help save GPs an hour a day on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Soup fits the bill&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So chicken soup is easy to prepare, affordable, safe for most people and widely recognized as a comforting, familiar home remedy for minor illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, our review highlighted a clear need for more research. Future studies could examine standardized soup recipes and investigate whether particular combinations of nutrients or herbs work best: does chicken soup have the same effect as barley broth or vegetable potage? Is there a difference if it's homemade versus canned?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as importantly, future research needs to measure meaningful outcomes: how quickly people return to work or school, how well they sleep during illness, how they rate their comfort and energy levels, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soup isn't a replacement for medicine. But alongside rest, fluids and paracetamol, it might offer a simple way to ease symptoms and help people feel better.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260960/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Okra's health benefits definitely make it worth the effort.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brazilian researchers discovered that okra, a fuzzy green pod often overlooked in supermarkets, may help reduce body fat, improve blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and even protect vital organs like the liver f rom obesity-related damage &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this animal trial, researchers worked with newborn rats, dividing them into two initial groups based on litter size to simulate different feeding conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first group included only three pups per mother - allowing them to have more access to milk and gain weight more rapidly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other group followed a standard litter size of eight pups, creating more competition for milk and slower early growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At three weeks old, all rats were weaned and placed on one of two diets: a standard rodent diet or the same diet supplemented with 1.5 percent okra. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The form of the okra, whether fresh, powdered, or otherwise, was not specified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rats remained on their assigned diets until adulthood at 100 days old. Researchers tracked body weight, food and water intake, blood sugar, fat accumulation, and muscle mass every two days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also measured insulin sensitivity in both the body and brain, and analyzed inflammation markers in the hypothalamus, the brain region that regulates appetite and energy balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By adulthood, rats from small litters on a standard diet showed greater food consumption, higher blood sugar, and increased fat mass compared to the others, highlighting the metabolic risks tied to early-life overnutrition and the potential mitigating effects of okra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While human trials are still needed, scientists believe introducing okra early in life could offer protective health effects over time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rats that were overfed early in life showed clear signs of metabolic dysfunction, including insulin resistance, a key driver of Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, those same rats who were later placed on an okra-supplemented diet had lower blood sugar and cholesterol levels compared to those that didn’t receive okra, despite identical early-life overfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The small-litter rats on the okra diet also experienced slightly increased fat mass but showed gains in muscle mass, better glucose tolerance, and improved blood sugar control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Strikingly, their brains also exhibited reduced inflammation and responded to insulin administered directly into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was something not observed in the overfed rats on a standard diet, suggesting improved central insulin sensitivity, which plays a role in regulating hunger and energy balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, rats from standard-sized litters, whether on an okra diet or not, showed no significant differences in weight, blood sugar, fat accumulation, or brain inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This led researchers to conclude that okra's benefits may be most effective in those already at risk of obesity-related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While human trials have not yet been conducted, the researchers believe that compounds in okra, such as catechins, quercetin, and other phenolic antioxidants, may help counteract the long-term effects of early-life overnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They noted that consuming excess calories during critical developmental windows, whether in animals or humans, can lead to lasting damage to the liver, heart, and brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Introducing antioxidant-rich foods like okra, they suggest, could be a simple and affordable strategy to reduce metabolic disease risk later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The fruit can be eaten raw in salads or salsa as well as cooked or roasted along other fruits and vegetables into various dishes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the scientists believe that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of okra can help fight against the damage caused by obesity, improve blood sugar levels and heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, previous research has shown that eating okras can also reduce the risk of developing colon cancer and improves bone health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Krasuna noted: 'Fiber also helps with blood sugar control. It works by slowing down the absorption of sugar and carbs. Okra is a great high-fiber food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'One-half cup of cooked okra provides more than 2 grams of fiber - nearly 10 percent of what adults need in a day.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, one-half cup of cooked okra also provides 32 micrograms of Vitamin K (essential for blood clotting and bone health), 14 milligrams of Vitamin C (supports the immune system and enhances iron absorption) as well as 37 micrograms of folate ( a crucial B vitamin essential for cell growth and division). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fruit can be eaten raw in salads or salsa as well as cooked or roasted along other fruits and vegetables into various dishes. The study was published in Brain Research earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 18:24:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxNeXJQd3hrWF9uZUd3WEUxb1N3WDFJYl9PZG9wRS13M205MkVjQmpBSE9Pdzl4cmV2dVNpVVFLZDNEMy1HTXJ0c0ppSm53OHVoN3dpbDZHaEFUcU9uNnJXdHBzd3hwbzNlRU40N0JBaFFnb2lFWjRySDBabnFKZmVnRlBOcG1YblJEVW92b292N01hRmk1em9iMWt2M0xTbEEwdVHSAacBQVVfeXFMTlJVX2J4VkNDVlRJWktsdGd1TFZXWGtDaG1BZ2NCd3owa19BVDZXMnlFbUhXb2g0YXYxWHJQOW9Ec3RLNm9sazUwdjZFS0lObUVlbEVocnJxZFlUcWFTUVVWOF85aHJuVkhrWWFOVTJQOG5kVHIxUXc2WmpROXJENWJjdFEtSFF5bExLSW9VWE9IVzdHdHpsekVwNFh0cC1vZ0RWbkNJQmM</guid></item><item><title>想随着年龄的增长提高你的大脑吗？音乐可能是答案- Medical Xpress | Want to boost your brain as you age?

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term musical training may mitigate the age-related decline in speech perception by enhancing cognitive reserve, according to a study published in &lt;i&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/i&gt; by Claude Alain from the Baycrest Academy for Research and Education, Canada, and Yi Du from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;
     
     
     &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7587637799"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
     
&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Normal aging is typically associated with declines in sensory and cognitive functions. These age-related changes in perception and cognition are often accompanied by increased neural activity and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/functional+connectivity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;functional connectivity&lt;/a&gt;—the statistical dependence of activity between different brain regions—in widely distributed neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recruitment of neural activity and strengthening of functional connectivity are thought to reflect a compensatory strategy employed by &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt; to maintain optimal cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positive lifestyle choices, such as musical training, higher levels of education, and bilingualism, contribute to cognitive and brain reserve, which represents the accumulation of cognitive and neural resources before the onset of age-related brain changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive Reserve Theory suggests that this reserve accrued through experience and training can help mitigate the impact of age-related brain decline, leading to better-than-expected cognitive performance. Yet how cumulative reserves influenced by positive lifestyle factors affect &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neural+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neural activity&lt;/a&gt; in older populations remains controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate this question, the researchers used &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/functional+magnetic+resonance/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;functional magnetic resonance&lt;/a&gt; imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity in 25 older musicians, 25 older non-musicians, and 24 young non-musicians who were asked to identify syllables masked by noise sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The researchers focused their analysis on neural responses within the auditory dorsal stream, which includes auditory, inferior parietal, dorsal frontal motor, and frontal motor areas, supporting sound-to-action mapping and sensorimotor integration during speech processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As predicted, the results revealed reduced age-related declines in speech-in-noise performance among older musicians compared to older non-musicians. During speech-in-noise perception, the older non-musicians showed the typical age-related compensatory increase in functional connectivity in auditory dorsal streams bilaterally (i.e., in both hemispheres of the brain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, older musicians exhibited a connectivity pattern in bilateral auditory dorsal streams that resembled young non-musicians, with connectivity strength in the right dorsal stream correlating with speech-in-noise perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, older musicians exhibited a more youth-like spatial pattern of functional connectivity during the task, whereas older non-musicians consistently showed a spatial pattern that deviated from young non-musicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings support the "Hold-Back Upregulation" hypothesis, which posits that cognitive reserve from musical training promotes a more youthful functional connectivity pattern, leading to superior behavioral outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond merely compensating for age-related declines, cognitive reserve may work by maintaining the integrity and functional architecture of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neural+networks/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neural networks&lt;/a&gt;, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of aging on cognitive performance. But due to the study design, it was not possible to determine cause-and-effect relationships between &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/musical+training/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;musical training&lt;/a&gt; and performance in the perception task.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;According to the authors, future studies should further test the "Hold-Back Upregulation" hypothesis using different cognitive tasks, such as memory and attention tasks, and investigate other sources of reserve, such as physical exercise and bilingualism. Eventually, these findings may inform interventions aimed at preserving cognitive function and improving communication outcomes in aging populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lei Zhang adds, "A positive lifestyle helps older adults cope better with cognitive aging, and it is never too late to take up, and stick with, a rewarding hobby such as learning an instrument."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Yi Du adds, "Just like a well-tuned instrument doesn't need to be played louder to be heard, the brains of older musicians stay finely tuned thanks to years of training. Our study shows that this musical experience builds &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+reserve/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive reserve&lt;/a&gt;, helping their brains avoid the usual age-related overexertion when trying to understand speech in noisy places."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life may unfold as a continuous stream, but our memories tell a different story. We do not recall the past as one long, unbroken text. Instead, we remember it as a series of meaningful events, like how sentences are structured with grammar and punctuation. Like any narrative, this organization gives our experiences shape and coherence, helping us make sense of what and when things happen.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The brain must devote a lot of space to this herculean task, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong! It turns out that a tiny but mighty region pulls far more than its weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a paper &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(25)00360-5" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Neuron&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/locus+coeruleus/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;locus coeruleus&lt;/a&gt;, acts like a "&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/memory/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; reset button" during meaningful changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our key question was: as an experience unfolds, how does the brain 'know' when one meaningful memory has ended and the next should begin?" said UCLA psychology professor and first author David Clewett. "Research has shown that remaining in a stable context, such as the same room, binds sequential experiences together in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By contrast, experiencing a shift in context, or event boundary, drives memories apart to represent distinct events. In this way, context acts as the grammar of human memory. What we found is that the locus coeruleus is most active at event boundaries when memories become separated. Thus, this small region at the core of the brain's arousal system may serve to punctuate our thoughts and memories."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clewett and co-authors Ringo Huang at UCLA and Lila Davachi at Columbia recruited 32 volunteers who looked at pictures of neutral objects while inside an MRI scanner. To manipulate whether the surrounding context was stable or changing, simple tones were played in either the right or left ear.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Eight pure tones were repeated in the same ear to create a sense of a coherent event, then the tone switched to the other ear and changed in pitch to elicit perception of an event boundary. This repeat-switch pattern continued throughout the remainder of the sequence, creating the perception of four different auditory events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then tested how these tone switches influenced memory. They reasoned that time provides a window into how events are formed: when people successfully reconstruct the order of a sequence, it suggests these items are linked within a single memory. In contrast, it is harder to remember the precise sequence of events when they have been stored in separate, distinct memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they predicted, locus coeruleus activation at event boundaries predicted later memory separation, as shown by worse ability to remember the order of item pairs that spanned boundaries. The researchers also cross-checked their measurements of locus coeruleus activation against eye pupil dilation measurements taken at the same time, because pupils are known to dilate slightly both as new events occur and when the locus coeruleus is active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These measurements confirmed that observations during the fMRI were indeed capturing activation in this small brain area. Functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow while a person is inside the scanner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of this neural and memory reset signal were far-reaching. Stronger locus coeruleus activation at boundaries between events predicted larger changes in activation patterns within the hippocampus, a brain region that tracks contextual details like place and time and is central to the formation of new memories.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"Part of the job of the hippocampus is to map the structure of our experiences, so it has an index of the beginning, middle and ends of events. We found that the locus coeruleus may provide the critical 'start' signal to the hippocampus, as if saying, 'Hey, we're in a new event now,'" said Davachi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Prior work had shown that bursts of locus coeruleus activity help reconfigure brain networks to direct attention to new and important experiences. Our findings suggest that this updating signal is even more widespread, also reaching memory-related regions that carry representations of ongoing events."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined how brief bursts of locus coeruleus activation are influenced by background levels of locus coeruleus activity. This matters because locus coeruleus neurons operate in two distinct modes: a burst-like mode that flags significant events and forms new memories, and a background mode that regulates general alertness and stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The locus coeruleus is like the brain's internal alarm system," Clewett said. "But under chronic stress, this system becomes overactive. The result is like living with a fire alarm that never stops ringing, making it difficult to notice when a real fire breaks out."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the dynamic interplay between these firing patterns has been studied in the context of decision-making, perception and learning, its relevance for how we perceive and remember events has, thus far, been unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the authors set out to test whether bursts of locus coeruleus activation at event boundaries, the neural signals that segment memories, might be weakened or lost under conditions of chronic stress. This question posed a challenge, as fMRI alone cannot measure absolute levels of stress or locus coeruleus activation. To address this, they used an imaging method that indirectly measures neuromelanin, a pigmented neurochemical that accumulates in the locus coeruleus with repeated activation over time.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;As predicted, participants with a higher neuromelanin-related signal, thought to indicate &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic stress&lt;/a&gt;, showed weaker pupil dilation responses to event boundaries. Stronger low-frequency fluctuations in locus coeruleus activation, a proxy for background levels of activity, also predicted weaker spikes in locus coeruleus activation and pupil responses to boundaries during the task. Together, these findings suggest that chronic hyperarousal may blunt one's sensitivity to change, disrupting the cues that anchor and organize new episodes in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identification of the locus coeruleus as the gateway or conductor for memory formation may lead to better ways to treat PTSD and other memory-related disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, where the locus coeruleus is unusually hyperactive. There are potential ways to quiet an overactive locus coeruleus, whether pharmacologically or through slow-paced breathing or even hand-squeezed stress balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But good long-term solutions require further research and will take time to discover and bring to market. Perceiving events in the "right" way is directly linked to better memory, suggesting that improving locus coeruleus function is an effective target for either protecting or recovering memory function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Conducting basic science and clinical research is critical for opening new doors for treating debilitating disorders," Clewett said. "Recent legislative actions threaten this future, not only for scientific research but for breakthroughs that can improve the lives of patients and their families. It is perhaps ironic that at a time when legislation promises 'big and beautiful change,' it turns out one of the brain's smallest players may have the biggest impact on how we understand and remember our lives."&lt;/p&gt;

She picked her teeth constantly, a nervous habit, and in the absence of dental floss broke off the sharp silver teeth &lt;br&gt;of her comb and shoved the metal between her teeth. She refused to bathe. I found myself cataloguing all this, the many ways in which Alzheimer’s disease has ravaged her brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watching a parent transform into a toddler-like dependent who throws tantrums and can’t be left alone for more than five minutes is heartbreaking. But Heather Sandison, N.D., author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reversing-Alzheimers-Toolkit-Improve-Cognition/dp/0063339080?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10055.a.65207455%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Reversing Alzheimer’s;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Reversing Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;says it can also be highly motivating.

Plus, because women live longer, they have a 48% chance of developing dementia in their lifetimes compared with a 35% chance for men. It’s a safe bet that anyone who lives long enough will suffer from some form of memory loss. To prepare for this possibility, my husband and I have set up care plans (and set aside funds) so our adult children won’t have to make tough decisions on their own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;this simple act may protect your brain from dementia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Power of the Pen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I was a little girl, I’ve been putting pen to paper to track my thoughts and feelings, set goals and make sense of the world. Apparently I’m in good company. Joan Didion famously said, “We tell ourselves stories in order to live.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond providing clarity and the opportunity for self-reflection, science suggests that writing by hand has brain-protective benefits. A &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1219945/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:January 2024 study published in Frontiers in;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;January 2024 study published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1219945/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Psychology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Psychology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported that it activated more areas of the brain than typing and led to low-frequency synchronous brain waves in the back of the head (the visual cortex) via the sensory processing areas and all the way up to the top of the head (the motor cortex). “Such brain waves in exactly those parts of the brain are beneficial for learning and memory,” says study author &lt;a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/audrey.meer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Audrey van der Meer, Ph.D., M.Sc;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Audrey van der Meer, Ph.D., M.Sc&lt;/a&gt;., a professor of neuropsychology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another study, published in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5926989/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Journals of Gerontology in 2016;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journals of Gerontology &lt;/em&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, reported that &lt;strong&gt;journal writing reduced the odds of all-cause dementia by more than 50%&lt;/strong&gt;. Additionally, the use of more complex language in the writing predicted a 25% reduction in risk of Alzheimer’s. “You use your body and senses to a larger extent when writing by hand versus typing, and the letters you draw on paper need to be precisely formed, which requires hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills,” says van der Meer. “All that is great stimulation for the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So as I watch my mom sink into the abyss of dementia, I’ve naturally turned to writing as a lifeline. On a recent family vacation, I wrote about what we ate, what we did and who we saw, hoping to capture details my future brain might struggle to recall. It struck me that I was in essence creating revivable memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, my catalogs of daily activities evolved into handwritten letters addressed to a “future me” —something tangible for my adult children to use as an “Instruction Manual for Mom” should I ever begin losing my mind. Each letter in the series acknowledges a harsh truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, you are in the throes of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;dementia. I imagine it’s a special kind of hell to be locked &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;inside a brain that can’t follow &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;simple instructions, one that &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;can’t make sense of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;anything happening in the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;moment. It’s natural to be scared, to act in ways that are &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;counter to who you are, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;and that’s why you need skilled &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;around-the-clock help. Your children may tell you &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;you’re &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;not a burden. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trust me, they are lying.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others address specific aspects of the disease:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I know you don’t think &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;you stink, but you do. I know the water may feel like pins and needles on your thinning skin, but you need to wash yourself with soap and water. Even if it’s just a sponge bath. You also need to wear deodorant. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sometimes you will think someone who is long dead is still alive. Other times you will think someone who is very &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;much alive has passed away. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s awkward. Uncomfortable. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sad. So sad. But people &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;understand that you will make &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;mistakes. People will &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;forgive you your ailing brain. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you balk at the callous nature of these letters, the ones that say "&lt;em&gt;Make no mistake, this isn’t going to get better&lt;/em&gt;," keep in mind that I’m also cataloging favorite memories. I’m taking note of simple moments in our lives, remembering my mom when she was in her prime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case in point: Once, while we were driving the boys home from school, my mom spontaneously belted out Barry Manilow’s “Copacabana.” My boys and I joined in, fudging the words in a sort of chorus gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to create a paper trail of who I am and who my mom was so that if I begin slipping away, my family will have something tangible to hold on to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dizzying Toll of Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is wildly unpredictable: One person with it may become combative, while another remains blissfully complacent. Unfortunately, no matter how Alzheimer’s presents, there are no effective medications for the advanced disease. The Food and Drug Administration has approved a few immunotherapy drugs for early-stage Alzheimer’s, but they require frequent IV infusions, can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and carry risks of complications, including brain swelling (um, no thank you!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These new treatments are groundbreaking in that they can remove some of the disease-related proteins from the brain, but they’re not a cure,” says&lt;a href="https://www.dementiaresearcher.nihr.ac.uk/profile-dr-jessica-z-k-caldwell-cleveland-clinic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jessica Z.K. Caldwell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; Jessica Z.K. Caldwell&lt;/a&gt;, Ph.D., director of the Women’s Alzheimer’s Movement Prevention and Research Center at Cleveland Clinic. “And while the studies show strong positive effects for white men, the sample sizes for women and people of color were too small to draw definitive conclusions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one can predict whether I’ll develop Alzheimer’s disease. Even on the rare chance that I carry two copies of the APOE4 gene — the strongest known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s — my odds of developing the disease can be modified by lifestyle changes. &lt;strong&gt;Experts estimate that nearly half of dementia cases, even those that are genetically linked, might be delayed or prevented with certain lifestyle and behavioral changes. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s never too early to implement changes that foster better brain health, but it can be too late. My mom’s situation, unfortunately, falls into the latter category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Road Map for the Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time the cognitive changes of Alzheimer’s appear, the disease has been developing for decades. But much remains within our control, stresses Caldwell. In fact, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a 2024 report published in The Lancet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a 2024 report published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;linked 14 modifiable factors to reduced dementia risk — things like maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly and maintaining strong social connections&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to adopting such strategies, Caldwell says challenging your brain is critical: “If you’re coasting through life relying on devices instead of your own learning and memory, you’re missing an opportunity to strengthen neural circuits, grow new neurons and protect your brain.” With that in mind, I’m taking a proactive approach. Instead of consulting Siri for driving directions, calculations and random trivia, I’ve been using my head to come up with the answers (or doing the work to find them). I eat a diet rich in omega-3’s and blueberries. I exercise daily, meditate a few times each week and prioritize my oral health. And, of course, I write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no matter how much I prepare, I know there are no guarantees. That’s why my husband and I are open with our children about my mom’s decline — so they’ll understand what may lie ahead for us and how we hope they’ll navigate the disease should we follow the same path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope my boys will never have to give me the letters I’ve written; I hope that the steps I’m taking now will protect me over the long haul. But if things don’t work out in my favor, I view the written word as a prescription for healing — that of my children as much as my own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 17:46:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFBfRVJEX2d2S0dvQ0hfWmdibDJVX0NpSzNMR2IwSnpPVURjV0pCLVZrb3V4LTJFTmNack53c1BGYXlFaW1mQjRERGdoOEtPS29IOXRpVkVXdkdjaFJWQ0VfZF9ub2FHQ3RPQ3kxR2J3</guid></item><item><title>2025年，佛罗里达州有4人死于食肉细菌，其中包括一名圣约翰县居民- News4JAX | 4 people in Florida have died from a flesh-eating bacteria in 2025, including a St. Johns County resident - News4JAX</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi5AFBVV95cUxPSGNzYWZuX1JmME9IOTRpemI0VUtEb1JPb0FDNGlVdU5vZVg4R1psVUY2emVSRDBSa0ctWFhoMkYyaXdhaWRNbTQ5S2FYaGJaTjZjWTVzNWNFTHl4dVdMNTdoTDRPcUEwWnFWRlVEYkR2T3FNYlFTWnJpaXI5aXNUTWpiQ3FhMnJCYVA3b3pqWmJwbG93YWpNOExWQVhOXzRldktjZ09abmFJVXJjTVAtakdLdGVWeGdxNlNLeHNIQ0J3cTZ6RE1RMjhJb2dxcVdSTGJsc3Zfb3BESlV4QWt0eUQ3cTA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 fURyTV iQviKm articleBody" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ST.

So…which is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out, the answer depends on a few factors. So, we asked a gastroenterologist and a registered dietitian to weigh in.

The fruit contains both soluble fiber, which helps soften stool, and insoluble fiber, which adds bulk and helps move waste through the intestines, says Valerie Agyeman, R.D.N., dietitian and founder of &lt;a href="http://www.flourishheights.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Flourish Heights;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Flourish Heights&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This combo of soluble and insoluble fiber can help get things moving without being too harsh on the digestive system,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas also provide potassium, a mineral that supports muscle contractions, including those in the digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How bananas may help relieve constipation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key reason bananas may help you go is thanks to their fiber content. And in some cases, it’s their resistant starch, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistant starch is a form of carbohydrate that bypasses digestion and feeds your beneficial gut bacteria, helping support the microbiome. Unripe bananas (the ones on the greener side) are a solid source of resistant starch, and early research suggests this type of starch may improve constipation symptoms by supporting gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 clinical trial in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-024-79465-1&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fa65268799%2Fdo-bananas-help-you-poop%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scientific Reports;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; looked at resistant starch type‑3 (RS‑3), a form of starch found in unripe bananas, in adults with chronic constipation. Those who took RS‑3 daily for 12 weeks experienced a significant increase in bowel movement frequency and reported healthier stool consistency. They also saw improvements in their microbiome, specifically higher levels of beneficial bacteria strains, including Bifidobacterium and Akkermansia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this study didn’t test bananas directly, it highlights how resistant starch, the same component in unripe bananas, can support gut regularity in adults,” says Mishal Reja, M.D., a gastroenterologist and medical advisor at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.beekeepersnaturals.com%2F%3Fview%3Dnewgroup1_index_1742835651678&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fa65268799%2Fdo-bananas-help-you-poop%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Beekeeper’s Naturals;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Beekeeper’s Naturals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can bananas ever cause constipation?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There isn’t any evidence that suggests bananas can cause constipation. However, people with sensitive digestive systems (like those who have Irritable Bowel Syndrome) may react to bananas regardless of ripeness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In these individuals, even small amounts of fermentable sugars, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a19756314/fodmap-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:FODMAPs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;FODMAPs&lt;/a&gt; found in ripe bananas, can trigger symptoms like bloating, gas, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel habits, including diarrhea or constipation,” Dr. Reja says. “These symptoms occur because the sugars ferment in the gut and produce excess gas, which the digestive tract may struggle to handle effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since greener bananas have less fermentable sugars, they may be a better bet, but even these bananas can cause symptoms in certain people. If you experience symptoms after eating bananas or other similar foods, talk to your healthcare provider about next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should you try bananas for constipation?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, one medium banana a day is a good place to start whether you’re dealing with constipation occasionally or regularly, Agyeman says. That said, it’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor before changing up your diet, especially if you’re on medications or have pre-existing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just make sure to stick to one banana a day (ideally on the greener side) and aim to hit your hydration goals. “Eating too many bananas without enough fluid or [a variety of] fiber in your diet could have the opposite effect and slow things down,” Agyeman says. “Fiber needs water to do its job, so combining them helps maximize digestion support.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can squeeze bananas into many different meals, but adding the fruit to your breakfast or a snack works well for consistency. And if you don’t love bananas plain, try blending one into a smoothie with Greek yogurt, a scoop of protein powder, and flaxseeds, or slice it onto whole-grain toast with almond butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What else can help with constipation?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, getting more fiber every day is a tried-and-true way to help prevent constipation. “Eating bananas in moderation can be fine, but they shouldn’t be relied on as a main source of fiber,” Dr. Reja says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get more fiber, Agyeman recommends chia pudding, kiwi, prunes, cooked leafy greens, and hydrating soups. “These foods are high in fiber and water, which is the ideal combo for supporting healthy digestion,” she reiterates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a supplement, be sure to talk to your doctor first. Dr. Reja recommends one that contains prebiotic fibers like chicory root, acacia fiber, and partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG), all of which support gut health without causing bloating in most people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your symptoms persist or seriously interfere with daily life, call your doctor as it might be time for over-the-counter help. Dr. Reja says that might include some of the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polyethylene glycol (PEG 3350, like Miralax): It draws water into the colon and softens stool. It’s well-tolerated, but shouldn’t be used long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psyllium husk (like Metamucil): A bulk-forming fiber that helps regulate bowel movements by adding structure to the stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium citrate: A quick-acting osmotic laxative that is good for short-term use, but shouldn’t be used regularly without guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senna (like Senokot): A stimulant that activates bowel movements. It might be helpful occasionally, but it’s not for daily or long-term use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If over-the-counter remedies stop being effective or if your constipation persists for more than a couple of weeks despite doing things like drinking more water and eating more fiber, it’s time to check in with a doctor again. Other signs that warrant a doctor’s visit include significant abdominal pain, unintended weight loss, blood in the stool, or a sudden and persistent change in bowel habits, Dr. Reja says. “These symptoms could indicate an underlying condition that requires further evaluation and testing,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas won’t act as a laxative, but their fiber and resistant starch content might help you stay regular in the long run. For most people, starting with one medium banana a day is a safe bet—go for a greener one if you tolerate it well, but stick with a riper banana if you have a sensitive stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Reja reminds us: “When it comes to digestion, consistency matters more than quick fixes.” That means staying hydrated, eating plenty of whole plant foods that are rich in fiber, and seeing a doctor if your constipation persists. And if you’re into bananas, go ahead and peel one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Catriona Reddin, senior study author and researcher at the University of Galway, said: 'This research represents a significant contribution to our understanding of how some diabetes medications may impact brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Diabetes is a known risk factor for dementia, but whether glucose-lowering therapies can help prevent cognitive decline has remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our findings suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists, in particular, may have a protective effect on brain health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study comes after a similar experiment from the University of Florida, which tracked 400,000 Americans on glucose-lowering drugs and found dementia risk was 33 percent lower for GLP-1 users compared to other interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 8million adults in the US have some form of dementia, and 500,000 are diagnosed every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, one in eight US adults has reported taking Ozempic or similar medications at least once for diabetes or weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the new study, published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2831975"&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/a&gt;, researchers identified 26 studies that explored the relationship between GLP-1 agonist use and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These included a total of 164,531 participants, most of whom (65 percent) were men. The average age was 64 with a follow-up time of 31 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Wendy Williams, pictured here, is one of the most famous faces of dementia. She was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2023 at age 59&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bruce Willis (pictured here) was also diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2023 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies included in the analysis were published between 2015 and 2024. Of the 26 in the review, 10 looked at the impact of GLP-1 agonists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team suspected GLP-1 agonists may lower inflammation, which is a major driver of dementia. It's thought to activate the immune cells microglia and astrocytes in the brain, which damage neurons and disrupt the blood-brain barrier, the brain's protective layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;GLP-1 agonists have also been shown to lower blood pressure and protect blood vessels, reducing the risk of vascular dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thecardiologyadvisor.com/news/study-suggests-glp-1ras-may-reduce-dementia-risk/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;study published in April&lt;/a&gt; also found GLP-1s may stimulate neural growth in the hippocampus, an area of the brain responsible for learning and memory formation. However, this research is early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Martin O'Donnell, Dean of the College of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences at University of Galway: 'Given the increasing prevalence of both diabetes and dementia, findings from this study have important public health implications for prevention of dementia.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent reports from the Alzheimer's Association report rates of Alzheimer's disease - the most common form of dementia - &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14683527/alzheimers-rises-25th-years-people-diagnosed.html"&gt;have risen 25 years in a row in the US&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diabetes, meanwhile, affects 12 percent of Americans - 38million.

A bit farther back was the offending bump, large and nearly brushing the inside of her teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her dentist insisted that whatever it was, it &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14786545/Womans-mouth-cancer-deadly-common-infection.html"&gt;would go away with time&lt;/a&gt;. Thirty-six at the time, fit, healthy, and a nonsmoker, Powell was not a high risk for &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-f75ea270-618e-11f0-a87f-05a3c163b258"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. But weeks passed, and the bump remained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Powell went to an urgent care clinic in January 2020, where the doctor referred her to an ear, nose, and throat specialist, who performed a biopsy of the bump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A week went by in silence until Powell got the news that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14654813/Common-mouth-problem-warning-sign-cancer-tongue-removed.html"&gt;the bump was cancerous&lt;/a&gt;, and it had spread to her lymph nodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her diagnosis kicked off what she considers to be the most 'morbid' period of her life, starting with a tongue resection surgery and 30 grueling radiation treatments that she often wished she could quit early because the pain was so great. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tongue cancer accounts for less than one percent of all new cancer cases in the US every year. Around 20,000 cases and 3,200 deaths are confirmed annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Thirty-six at the time, fit, healthy, and a nonsmoker, Jamie Powell was not a high risk for cancer. Neither she nor her dentist could believe that the obtrusive bump on the side of her tongue could be a cancerous mass&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the rate of deaths due to tongue cancer has remained about the same for about two decades, the patient profile of new cases of tongue cancer is beginning to shift from primarily older male smokers to women and younger healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oral cancers usually spread quickly if left untreated, and Powell is confident that hers was allowed to grow unchecked when she was sent home from her dentist’s office over five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It was scary and frustrating not to know what was going on and not having anyone listen to me,’ she told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://people.com/cancer-survivor-reflects-on-life-five-years-after-tongue-surgery-11768664"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Powell had a section of her tongue surgically removed on March 23, 2020, just as Covid was getting its grip on the world. Doctors reconstructed it using tissue taken from her thigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I remember the surgeon describing the surgery to me. I was just numb, and I heard him say that my voice will be different,’ she said. ‘I instantly thought of my kids. How will I sing to them? How will I tell them how much I love them?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She then had all of the lymph nodes removed on her left side to stop the spread of the cancer in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I couldn’t talk or eat. I had a feeding tube and I used my iPad to communicate to the doctors and nurses,’ Powell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also had to endure six weeks of radiation treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Powell had a section of her tongue surgically removed on March 23, 2020, just as Covid was getting its grip on the world&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With her head encased in a mesh mask that is bolted to a radiation table to ensure complete stillness, Powell suffered sunburn-like charred skin on her neck, blisters on her lips, and painful ulcers in her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Off the table, she was fatigued, nauseous, and had lost her sense of taste, so everything tasted of either wet cardboard or sewage. She also no longer had working salivary glands, resulting in a constant dry mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’d rather do surgery every single day than go through head and neck radiation again,’ Jamie, now 41, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jamieraepowell/video/7060165809494281519"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She lost her ability to speak by week three of radiation, her mouth essentially one big canker sore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After surgery, she had to retrain her brain to form sounds and piece them into words. She still has trouble with words starting with ‘sh’ and ‘ch’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating without salivary glands requires her to sip water after every bite. And if she has a dinner date with friends, she has to decide ahead of time whether she will eat or talk. She can no longer do both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At bedtime, she does not recline. Instead, she sits back as if in an airplane seat, propped against acupressure pillows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Think about when you’re sleeping and you wake up and your mouth is dry. I have that 24/7, and it’s heightened to the next exponent at night. So I have to sleep sitting up no matter what,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Radiation treatments led to irritated sun burned-like skin on her neck, sores in her mouth, and blisters around her lips&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And I wake up every hour from choking because of the dry mouth, so I take a drink of water, and I also have a spray bottle, and I will spray the inside of my mouth, like how you water your house plant.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every morning, at four am, she has to pry her jaw open with both hands and use the handle of a spoon to prop her mouth open so that she can stretch it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘For months after radiation, I couldn’t taste anything, then one morning I made my coffee and I could actually taste it - I cried,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Powell began documenting her experience on TikTok when she realized there were no other creators like her on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tongue cancer is rare, but federal tracking indicates it is becoming more common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rates of new cases have risen &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/tongue.html"&gt;about 49 percent&lt;/a&gt; since 1992, according to the National Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases are becoming increasingly common in women and young people, which scientists believe are tied to human papillomavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 70 percent of oropharyngeal cancers affecting the tonsils, base of the tongue, soft palate, and throat are linked to HPV, yet only 61 percent of US teens are fully vaccinated against the virus, which requires two or three doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The death rate due to tongue cancer has remained steady for decades, but case rates are ticking up in part, scientists believe, due to human papillomavirus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 42 million Americans carry HPV, a virus that causes genital warts and cancers like cervical, throat, and anal malignancies, with 47,000 new HPV-related cancer cases diagnosed yearly. Despite this, public awareness of HPV’s cancer risks is declining, even as vaccination remains a critical defense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Most oral cancers are missed until it’s in the later stages,’ Powell said. ‘I’ve learned that no one should go through this alone. The more we talk about this cancer, the more help we can be to one another.’&lt;/p&gt;

It also broadcasts tiny timing shifts that doctors read as heart rate variability (HRV), a window into the balance of your autonomic nervous system (ANS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A five‑month field study now suggests those shifts rise and fall with patterns in space weather. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study makes a striking correlation between people’s HRV and energetic environmental phenomena such as the electromagnetic energy from the sun, the &lt;a href="https://www.heartmath.org/gci/gcms/live-data/gcms-magnetometer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Schumann resonance power&lt;/a&gt;, and energy influxes coming from outside our solar system,” said Rollin McCraty of the &lt;a href="https://www.heartmath.org/"&gt;HeartMath Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-solar-storms-spikes-heart-rate"&gt;Solar storms spikes heart rate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Abdullah Alabdulgader of the &lt;a href="https://www.hziegler.com/employers/prince-sultan-cardiac-center.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prince Sultan Cardiac Center&lt;/a&gt; in Saudi Arabia led weekly 72‑hour ECG sessions for sixteen healthy volunteers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers matched each session against hourly logs of solar wind speed, sunspot counts, cosmic ray flux, and local geomagnetic indices collected by NASA and &lt;a href="https://www.sgo.fi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Finland’s Sodankylä Observatory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Increase in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/silent-storms-experts-identify-the-mysterious-source-of-solar-wind/"&gt;solar wind&lt;/a&gt; intensity was correlated with increases in heart rate, which we interpret as a biological stress response,” said Dr. Alabdulgader. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the wind strengthened, inter‑beat intervals shortened, hinting at a sympathetic spike even on calm clinical days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heart-variability-during-solar-storms"&gt;Heart variability during solar storms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart rate variability is commonly split into high‑frequency, low‑frequency, and very‑low‑frequency bands. The Saudi team saw all three bands climb when cosmic ray counts, solar radio flux, and local Schumann resonance power went up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cosmic rays seemed especially potent. Total HRV power rose for almost 40 hours after particle counts peaked. A European &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17338964/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; echoed this effect, linking higher cosmic rays to lower C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geomagnetic quiet was not always benign. A U.S. analysis of 263 cities found that disturbed fields, measured by Kp and Ap indices, coincided with increased cardiovascular deaths on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-electromagnetic-fields-and-the-heart"&gt;Electromagnetic fields and the heart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would charged particles millions of miles away nudge heart rhythms? One possibility is that they tweak the ionosphere, altering the ultra‑low‑frequency waves that bathe Earth’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists first noticed in the 1950s that the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26785376/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;primary Schumann&lt;/a&gt; peak near 7.83 Hz matches &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3507158/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;alpha brain oscillations&lt;/a&gt;. Modern EEG research shows brief real‑time coherence between Schumann power and cortical activity during geomagnetic spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These same frequencies overlap with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7560965/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;vagal signaling&lt;/a&gt; that drives the high‑frequency band of HRV. The Saudi dataset supports the idea that the heart, like the brain, can phase‑lock to natural electromagnetic cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-calm-waves-calmer-beats"&gt;Calm waves, calmer beats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schumann power rose during thunderstorms and quiet solar intervals alike. When this occurred, participants’ heart rates slowed and parasympathetic tone strengthened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results mirrored a smaller trial in Japan that recorded lower blood pressure on strong Schumann days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory studies show that mammals and birds align circadian genes with weak radio‑frequency fields, though precise receptors remain debated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnetite nanoparticles in cardiac and neural tissue may act as primary sensors, while &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10966452/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;retinal cryptochromes&lt;/a&gt; could relay secondary signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-solar-storms-impact-heart-health"&gt;Solar storms impact heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, the effects are subtle, but population data suggest they are still significant. A global review conducted in 2023 showed that stronger overall geomagnetic fields were linked to slight increases in cardiovascular deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the horizontal part of the field appeared to have a protective effect – highlighting how geomagnetic exposure may influence health in complex ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians already use heart rate variability to flag autonomic imbalance in diabetes, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/meditation-can-rapidly-reduce-ptsd-without-revisiting-trauma/"&gt;PTSD&lt;/a&gt;, and post‑infection fatigue. If space weather can tip that balance, wearable monitors might one day combine cardiology and heliophysics to time workouts, surgeries, or even trading floors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every scientist is convinced. A National Institutes of Health panel recently referred to the current evidence as intriguing yet inconclusive, noting that lab replications with shielded chambers are still scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-emergency-planning-for-space-weather"&gt;Emergency planning for space weather&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/massive-geomagnetic-storm-reveals-earths-technological-vulnerabilities/"&gt;geomagnetic&lt;/a&gt; factors affect heart and nervous system activity – even subtly – then hospitals and emergency services may need to adjust staffing or readiness protocols during peak solar events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historical data already confirm that ER visits and psychiatric admissions spike during geomagnetic disturbances. People who are at risk from arrhythmia, hypertension, or mental illness may experience the strongest effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weather forecasts increasingly include space weather alerts, but medical infrastructure hasn’t caught up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors, paramedics, and health agencies could benefit from predictive models that track these environmental stressors and inform care delivery for vulnerable groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-further-research-is-needed"&gt;Further research is needed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Saudi volunteers were young, healthy, and living at low geomagnetic latitude. We do not yet know whether patients with arrhythmias, hypertension, or pacemakers react the same way at polar latitudes where field swings are stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dose matters too. Satellites warn of major solar storms days in advance, but subtle changes within the “quiet” range may fly below meteorological forecasts while still nudging sensitive physiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, correlation is not causation. Although animal studies shows pulsed fields can shift heart‑rate timing, the precise chain from ionospheric disturbance to vagus nerve firing remains only partially mapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies may include networks that monitor heart rate variability across multiple locations, along with magnetometers and possibly even &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-mapping-research-mouse-neurons-revolutionary-advance/"&gt;genetic screening&lt;/a&gt; for traits linked to magnetic sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the evidence suggests we should consider space weather as one more environmental factor that may influence heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323016904_Long-Term_Study_of_Heart_Rate_Variability_Responses_to_Changes_in_the_Solar_and_Geomagnetic_Environment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 16:41:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9pSkhwczJSd1d0bFVwa2xoUlo1MmpEZ0ZnWW1wcG51S0tuSE9IdDV1Rlo2S2lNQjQ2cjdXSUhROTZISE9aMkJJUVlXQ2JwSU5QOHRiRi1LQ2pXenFYd1Q1SFZDSkFqVGNMOGF6VExpeURTZGJjalJscl9wOA</guid></item><item><title>有人告诉男人，他需要一条毛巾才能坐在躺椅上，所以他带着一个遵守规则的人回来了- TwistedSifter | Man Was Told He Needed A Towel To Sit On The Lounge Chairs, So He Came Back With One That Followed the Rules - TwistedSifter</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2gFBVV95cUxONWtmeC1OMmlJQ1hfSWQ0UEZpSzgtNUFXbDVQdXNNc0JiTXV5Z0x4eXJORXl6ZmJPYUkwcDIta0JKNEtDYTJNeFBOUDNsdFZ2TFJ0WWVEV2VUUXlPNkZhOVJOdGNncnRyaFpiQW1tMC0zQzhqcl9rRTljM2tBU2dfZ3NTb3BkQmwxVy1WMDlZMXRROHRJdThjUmRpSmhOZXBwWldnX0FncjFFZFBiYUdadUNZRHdkNXRmWDdUTTUxc2xqcWEyMHhLbE9IUlYwODctMC1SelB1VW9tUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some attendants enforce rules without considering exceptional cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mm-player"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were told you had to have a towel to sit on the lounge chairs at the pool, would you argue about how absurd the rule was, or would you go get a towel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1l12vgr/apartment_pool_required_a_towel_im_fully_clothed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;This man&lt;/a&gt; was flagged by a pool attendant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was not using a towel on the lounge chairs because he was fully clothed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the attendant said it’s not allowed, and he still has to use a towel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, he found a clever way to follow the rule exactly as written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the full story below for all the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Apartment pool required a towel (I’m fully clothed)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apartment pool attendant said I need a towel to sit on the lounge chairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I am fully clothed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Must be a new rule as I’ve been here 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This man contested the rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said the rule is for people who are in bathing suits, which is very obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said my sweatshirt is made of cotton and so are towels, so it’s just a towel that I’m wearing around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said it doesn’t satisfy the rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pool attendant told him there is no specific size for towels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, after a quick trip to my apartment, I asked him if it specifies what size the towel must be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which he replied there isn’t a size rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I said, great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And placed my 1 inch by 1 inch towel back into my pocket and sat back down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOL. That’s funny. Let’s find out what others have to say about this on Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;

Some doctors and medical practices are &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2024/cancer-blood-test-screening/"&gt;already using them&lt;/a&gt;, and the field has been propelled forward by innovation and hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MAJXNMQ4NZAOVDMEBB5UO2R24E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Turning these innovative technologies into usable medical tools for the broader population has been complex. But a study recruiting subjects this summer, funded by the National Cancer Institute, seeks to begin to do that by answering basic questions about how the tests perform in comparison to more conventional cancer screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="YV2Z45NXYZELHJLBBYTJ5ANALY" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="YV2Z45NXYZELHJLBBYTJ5ANALY" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What will the study consider?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ECSK5LPSQBBWXNWOQOHQ5JOHSY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A screening test given to millions of healthy people has to be accurate to avoid costly and anxiety-inducing follow-ups. And for it to become part of routine medical care, there needs to be evidence that the test can reliably find cancers — perhaps far earlier than routine methods.

People could roll up their sleeves and get a blood test to flag 20 cancers, allowing physicians to give early treatments when they have no symptoms.

That meant that many men were aggressively treated, with surgery and radiation that caused them to be incontinent or impotent for years or decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IXQ65ALXOBDGTNPTZY55VI7TMU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The recommendations on how to test for prostate cancer changed as these trends became clear over decades. Ramsey said that now is the right moment to be subjecting these cancer blood tests to scrutiny. The potential for the tests is enormous, but there are fundamental questions that need to be answered about how and when they should be used — and, perhaps, when they shouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="PYFYLWDLWBD4XM4JIEBJ7DJ5E4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="PYFYLWDLWBD4XM4JIEBJ7DJ5E4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What needs to happen next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="V6REZE437ZFLTN5WLTHUSI3TTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The  recent study in &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article-abstract/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-25-0375/763427/Detection-of-Cancers-Three-Years-prior-to" target="_blank"&gt;Cancer Discovery&lt;/a&gt; illustrated one of the major problems facing the field. To detect cancers early, the tests need a big boost in sensitivity, because they need to find fragments of cancer tumor DNA that are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BMRSOOFH7VDDDANMEETVBIYMTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That study found that it was possible to detect cancer three or more years than a traditional diagnosis. “It can be done — and that’s an important part of the article, much earlier than had ever been shown before,” said Vogelstein, part of the team behind the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AT7BR2A24FCPFJ3SFAFA425BSA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But to detect those trace amounts of genetic material, the sensitivity of the test had to be roughly 50 times higher than what it is in tests today, he said — and would likely cost a few thousand dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WQT4VV5ZI5FP5BY6HBIONZU2HE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Ramsey said current tests can be $900 or more.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's common knowledge that obesity is a global epidemic, particularly in industrialized countries, and that it is a major cause of disease and poor overall health. However, there has been a tug-of-war in the debate of whether the main cause of obesity is diet or a lack of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Calories consumed must be expended as energy, whether through &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; or basal activity—the inherent processes within the body that use up energy, such as breathing or digesting food. When it comes to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/obesity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, it has been unclear if too many calories are being consumed on average to be used by normal activity or if there is not enough activity to expend a reasonable amount of calories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study, &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2420902122" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt;, focuses on the problem of diet vs. exercise. Amanda McGrosky and her team analyzed data from 4,213 adults, aged 18 to 60, across 34 populations in six continents. The sample is impressively diverse and covers people from hunter-gatherer groups, pastoralists, farmers, and industrialized societies. This includes people with a wide range of diets and activity levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined total &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/energy+expenditure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;energy expenditure&lt;/a&gt; (TEE), activity energy expenditure (AEE), basal energy expenditure (BEE) and two measures of obesity: body fat percentage and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/body+mass/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;body mass&lt;/a&gt; index (BMI). AEE is a representation of energy expended by exercise and was found by subtracting BEE from the TEE. The results were categorized into groups by the level of economic development, using the UN Human Development Index (HDI), due to the general lifestyle and dietary differences among groups at different levels of economic development.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The results initially found TEE, AEE and BEE to be higher in more developed populations, along with body mass, BMI and body fat, meaning obesity was more prevalent in more economically developed countries, but it appeared that they were also expending more energy overall. However, this is not the total picture.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledged that body size in general, like height, was overall larger in industrialized places. There are also fluctuations in weight and energy expenditure due to age and sex. The researchers further refined their data by adjusting for these factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results then showed that TEE and BEE decreased slightly, by around 6–11%, with economic development. After adjusting for age, sex and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/body+size/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;body size&lt;/a&gt;, AEE was still higher overall in more economically developed populations, indicating that it is not likely to be a lack of exercise that is causing higher BMI or body fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that total energy expenditure is only weakly associated with obesity, accounting for about 10% of the increased incidence of obesity in more economically developed countries. Instead, they indicate that a higher consumption of ultra processed foods (UPF), like processed meats, ready-made meals and snack cakes, is to blame, noting that "the percent of UPFs in the diet was positively correlated with body fat percentage."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite exercise not being the main driver of obesity, the study authors encourage regular &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/exercise/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;, as it is still known to be key in preventing disease and maintaining better mental health. The study also highlights the need for an emphasis on reducing calories from highly processed foods to help address the obesity crisis, but also to continue to study what makes certain foods lead to obesity, as UPFs appear to affect the body in unique ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They write, "The hyperpalatability, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/energy+density/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;energy density&lt;/a&gt;, nutrient composition, and appearance of UPF might disrupt satiety signaling and encourage overconsumption. Processing has also been shown to increase the percentage of calories consumed that are absorbed into the body rather than excreted."&lt;/p&gt;

BPD is as valid a diagnosis as schizophrenia or depression, which is to say that it is a well-studied clinical phenomenon that lacks biological markers. It has a coherent clinical presentation that differs from affective disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder (&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/topics/ptsd"&gt;PTSD&lt;/a&gt;), with a characteristic onset in adolescence and outcome in adulthood.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1,2&lt;/sup&gt; The term &lt;em&gt;borderline&lt;/em&gt; is a point of contention in the fields of psychiatry and psychology, with varying interpretations leading to an unstable—and occasionally confusing—delineation of its boundaries.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;3,4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;div class=" figure"&gt;&lt;div id="image-caption" class="text-gray-500 italic"&gt;&lt;div class="blockText_blockContent__TbCXh"&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIGURE. &lt;/strong&gt;Prevalence of Borderline Personality Disorder&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s in a Name?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Borderline is used to describe a borderline personality organization, based on Otto Kernberg, MD’s 1975 conceptualization, which is considerably more expansive than &lt;em&gt;DSM&lt;/em&gt;’s description of BPD.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; It is characterized by diffuse identity, predominant use of primitive defenses, and intact but fragile reality testing (ie, with the possibility of brief psychotic lapses in response to stressful situational events).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;In addition, borderline is used in reference to BPD, ie, to a specific clinical syndrome introduced to the &lt;em&gt;DSM&lt;/em&gt; in 1980 based on the pioneering work of John Gunderson, MD.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; It is characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affect, as well as marked impulsivity. BPD emerges during early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by 5 or more of the 9 criteria. BPD represents only approximately 10% to 25% of the patients who would be considered to have borderline personality organization.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Another interpretation of borderline places it as a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. This perspective gained traction in the 1960s and 1970s, emphasizing the proclivity of patients with borderline to experience transient psychotic episodes. Unlike those associated with &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/topics/schizophrenia"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, these episodes are typically brief, self-limiting, and triggered by situational stressors. Psychotic experiences may also be evidenced outside these discrete episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Borderline is also used to describe an affective spectrum disorder. The historical description of affective instability in borderline psychopathology has prompted some clinicians to hypothesize a correlation with mood pathology or even to consider borderline personality psychopathology as an attenuated variant of bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Borderline can be conceptualized as an impulse spectrum disorder because of the propensity for characteristic impulsive action. These are typically driven by an inner state (emotion or thought) that cannot be experienced at the level of inner experience, and that the patient feels the need to immediately express through action. Self-injury, suicide, substance abuse, and other risky behaviors are most concerning for clinicians, patients’ families, and social environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;A sixth potential interpretation is that BPD may represent a chronic form of PTSD. The significant correlation between traumatic experiences in early childhood and the subsequent development of psychopathology in adulthood has been well documented. The inclusion of BPD in the trauma spectrum gives primacy to the relationship with childhood traumatic events, attachment disorders, and defensive mechanisms that are predominantly dissociative in nature and put in place in response to trauma, and to the symptomatologic manifestations that are more likely to be traced to a traumatic genesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Borderline is also used as a catch-all category for any condition that does not fit neatly into the established nosographic patterns. The establishment of dichotomous categories within psychiatric nosology has been observed to give rise to the reappearance of hybrid clinical entities that disrupt the established nosographic patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Finally, borderline is used as a simplistic and inappropriate marker of failure, ie, when the clinician’s efforts are proved to be ineffective or unsuccessful (eg, admissions to services or psychotherapy pathways). This approach ignores the difficulties that patients with borderline may experience in forming relationships and the challenges that clinicians may face in managing and containing negative emotions (eg, hostility, anxiety, confusion, helplessness, and boredom), which are inherent to the intense and turbulent relationship with these patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;For these reasons, the patient with borderline represents a psychopathological figure in a state of perpetual suspension, traversing a series of positions and pathways whose significance can only be fully appreciated when viewed from an expanded perspective of individual episodes and the broader sequence of experiences and situations that shape the borderline condition. This fundamental aspect of borderline psychopathology renders it a true migrant within the field of mental health.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Essence of Borderline Psychopathology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;The construct of BPD is internally consistent and more homogeneous than is commonly assumed.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Thus, several theoretical models have been put forth to elucidate the core features that underpin the observed phenotypic heterogeneity.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1,3,6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Is there a psychopathological core that enables the clinical identification across theoretical models and perspectives? As early as the 1950s, Melitta Schmideberg, MD, posited that the defining characteristic of borderline psychopathology is its inherent instability, calling it “stable in its instability.”&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; This implies that the patient perceives instability as an inherent and fundamental aspect of their identity, establishing it as the bedrock of their own functioning. Consequently, this perception also influences the conceptualization of the pathology itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;But what does instability mean from a clinical point of view? A relational-affective vulnerability may be identified, which can be further delineated into 3 subdimensions: (1) a pronounced predisposition toward distrust and resentment toward others; (2) an inability to regulate one’s internal states and to tolerate and manage emotions, particularly negative ones; and (3) ineffectual attempts to cope with and express this distressing internal experience.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;These experiences are often rooted in distressing and traumatic events that occurred during childhood. They function as a catalyst for overreactions to situational events, particularly those involving interpersonal variables, in a dynamic relationship between past and present, which is mediated by protective and risk factors.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; This response reinforces the patient’s traumatic experience of contact with the external world, particularly with other individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;From this perspective, the array of borderline symptoms can be seen as an external manifestation of this relational-affective vulnerability; this interpersonal focus incorporates Gunderson’s seminal contribution to the understanding of borderline psychopathology.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The relational-affective vulnerability that is solicited by contingent stressful events results in the patient experiencing painful emotional states, which they attempt to escape. This is discerned by pursuing 2 distinct paths: one that is organizing and one that is disorganizing, with each culminating in disparate acute phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Anger and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) are the most illustrative examples of organizing internal painful experiences. Anger serves to eliminate a source of irritation or pain, remove an obstacle to gratification, and restore a sense of autonomy in the face of highly frustrating situations.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;10,11&lt;/sup&gt; When anger is projected in the form of hostility, it temporarily rids the patient of these intolerable feelings about themself. Similarly, NSSI has the advantage of positioning negative emotions in a behavioral circuit that leads to a state of reduced tension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;In contrast, a state of disorganization and confusion about personal identity, corresponding to a series of painful experiences of emptiness, insubstantiality, and inauthenticity, is the most representative example of the failure of patients to organize painful internal experiences. When emptiness or aloneness is particularly intense, there may be an attempt to pursue an organizing path, often achieved through impulsive action, which provides a sense of cohesion and coherence to the self, restores a sense of vitality, and fosters hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;It can be said that BPD is fundamentally a disorder of paradox, in which the patient is trapped in a need-fear dilemma,&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;12,13&lt;/sup&gt; which is a simultaneous need for and fear of closeness with other persons. Thus, the patient teeters back and forth like a yo-yo in interpersonal relations,&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; placing the object in a classic double bind&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;: too far and the patient’s abandonment fears are triggered, too close and the patient responds masochistically by pushing the object away. This dynamic contributes to much of the interpersonal dysfunction observed in BPD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stigma and the Anti-BPD Movement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Patients and their caregivers/families frequently encounter structural stigma when accessing health services, resulting in poor health outcomes.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;16,17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Klein et al explored the international literature on structural stigma associated with BPD.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; The review highlighted 3 commonly held myths that continue to impede its understanding: (1) uncertainty about BPD as a legitimate mental illness; (2) concerns about disclosing a BPD diagnosis; and (3) the perception of BPD as an untreatable condition. Consequently, individuals are frequently denied evidence-based treatment and excluded from the health care system through a process of demedicalization.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;This notion has been reinforced in recent years by Roger Mulder, PhD, MBChB, and Peter Tyrer, FMedSci, who have argued that BPD has no place in clinical practice and that the diagnosis should be abandoned because it is inappropriately used, provides little information, creates confusion and uncertainty, and generates enormous stigma.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; The authors state that BPD has no basis in the scientific study of personality and is used indiscriminately to describe a range of negative interactions in human relationships that have causes far beyond personality function. Their paper has become a manifesto for an anti-BPD movement, which is part of a broader movement against modern psychiatry in the US. It is not within the scope of this paper to comment on the merits of this wider movement, which one of us has covered elsewhere.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;We argue that the anti-BPD movement can be dangerous for at least 2 reasons. Firstly, it contributes to the growing phenomenon of medical mistrust,&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; which has sometimes resulted in attacks on medical staff by patients or their families. Secondly, it is attracting an increasingly large group of patients (and their caregivers/families) who are angry (understandably) at mental health professionals because of repeated and frustrating experiences of malpractice. This process of channeling borderline anger forcibly addresses the organization of painful internal experiences previously discussed as essential to borderline functioning. However, it does not allow for the opportunity to work with these experiences in an appropriate and beneficial way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;The anti-BPD movement carries the risk of fueling mystification and chaos, as well as group defensive processes of splitting and projective identification. Borderline may be viewed as a witch to be burned at the stake, with clinicians who proffer this label becoming the perpetrators and those who proffer an antilabel becoming the saviors. There has been a proliferation of communities of angry patients on social networks that refer to the Mad in America website and exist to fight back against the pathologization and the use of labels. Such trends demonstrate en masse the very psychodynamics that characterize BPD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Can Really Help Patients?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;The pervasiveness of the stigma associated with BPD within health systems highlights the necessity for a comprehensive approach to addressing the underlying issues and implementing effective solutions. These issues extend beyond the realm of the BPD diagnosis; they pertain to the culture and delivery of health services and care.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;It can be—and has been—argued that renaming is not an effective solution to the negative beliefs and discrimination that are prevalent in society.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;9,22&lt;/sup&gt; Indeed, removing the borderline label would result in these patients being orphaned from a diagnostic framework, thereby compromising their access to evidence-based treatments. Renaming could potentially result in the obfuscation of the disorder’s complex and often challenging nature, which is relational in nature and manifests not only within the individual but also within the clinical relationship and even within the broader social reference community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Similarly, categorizing BPD as a form of trauma and reducing it to a description of childhood adversity is an inadequate approach to the condition.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; This fails to account for the complex developmental etiology and thus may reinforce victimization, failing to acknowledge the strong sense of agency that many patients possess.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;What, then, might be the most efficacious approach for assisting patients with BPD?&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1,3,18,19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Firstly, clinicians must be provided with the requisite support in understanding the clinical complexity of the borderline condition, the role of situational interpersonal triggers (which are less well known than the impact of childhood traumas), the emotive burden associated with it, and the most effective treatments. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/topics/psychotherapy"&gt;Psychotherapy&lt;/a&gt; is the preferred treatment, whereas pharmacotherapy is recommended only for addressing discrete and severe comorbid disorders, such as severe depression or anxiety, or transient psychotic symptoms.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; Furthermore, pharmacotherapy should be administered for the shortest feasible duration and solely as a crisis intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Secondly, it is imperative to pursue further investigation into the disorder’s psychopathological core, which underlies the diversity of symptoms. This will facilitate a deeper comprehension of patients’ subjective experience. Research should be conducted on the developmental prodromes of adult-onset BPD, with particular attention to adolescence to facilitate the identification and treatment of high-risk clinical indicators for BPD before the disorder becomes disabling and thus challenging to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Thirdly, disseminating information about generalist models is essential. Clinicians should receive training in at least 1 generalist model that incorporates features of specialized evidence-based treatments (eg, Gunderson’s good psychiatric management).&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; Treatments can be conducted by experienced clinicians, even without formal training in the specific treatment modality. In the absence of evidence-based psychotherapeutic modalities, experienced clinicians may employ psychoeducation or crisis management; these are also beneficial for family members of patients with BPD, who bear a significant burden. The generalist approach also holds promise for early intervention for personality disorders among youth.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Ultimately, further measures are necessary to reduce the stigma. It is not uncommon for individuals to delay seeking assistance, and when they do seek assistance, they are frequently confronted with stigma regarding the nature and treatability of their disorder. Given the considerable advances made in research and clinical practice, this situation is no longer tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Finally, it is essential to promote and reinforce the efforts of the civil rights movement (as opposed to antidisorder movements) in defense of the fundamental rights of individuals experiencing mental distress: the right to life; the right to health, dignity, and citizenship; and the right to live in an inclusive and supportive community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prof D’Agostino&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;is an associate professor of clinical psychology at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo in Italy.

That 1949 letter, discovered during a 2023 digitization project in Bavaria, pointed curators toward a shoebox of lemon‑yellow fragments that had sat unnoticed for decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Roland-Eichhorn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Roland Eichhorn&lt;/a&gt; of the Bavarian State Office for the Environment (&lt;a href="https://www.stmuv.bayern.de/english/index.htm"&gt;LfU&lt;/a&gt;) led the modern hunt that followed, and his team soon realized they were staring at humboldtine, one of the &lt;a href="https://www.mindat.org/reference.php?id=13861544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;scarcest minerals&lt;/a&gt; on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-humboldtine-treasure-hunt"&gt;Humboldtine treasure hunt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archivists scanning shelves in Hof found the coal‑mine owner’s note and the tantalizing phrase: “Humboldtine from the Mathias mine near Schwandorf.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their curiosity sent Eichhorn’s crew rifling through more than 130,000 catalogued specimens stored beneath the LfU headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a small box, the team found hazelnut‑sized yellow fragments and a handwritten label that matched the location mentioned in the letter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the tag confirmed as authentic, Eichhorn and his team began a full investigation to determine if the samples were truly humboldtine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-makes-humboldtine-special"&gt;What makes humboldtine special&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/geologists-discover-three-new-mineral-specimens-in-southwestern-us/"&gt;mineral&lt;/a&gt; is an organic mineral, a rare class whose crystal lattice holds carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen bound to metals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humboldtine’s formula couples iron with oxalate, giving it a soft hardness of 1.5-2 and a resinous yellow sheen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectors prize it because it has been documented at only 30 localities worldwide, scattered across eight countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each discovery of the mineral seems like a fluke, happening when iron-rich rocks come into contact with certain natural acids in just the right damp conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mineral first surfaced in 1821, when Peruvian geologist &lt;a href="https://revistas.up.edu.pe/index.php/apuntes/article/view/780/917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mariano de Rivero&lt;/a&gt; named it for the Prussian explorer &lt;a href="https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/explore/alexander-von-humboldt/a-name-to-conjure-with" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alexander von Humboldt&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historians count roughly 400 species and minerals that now bear Humboldt’s name, more than for any other individual in science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bavarian-brown-coal"&gt;Bavarian brown coal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bavarian nodules formed about eight feet below ground in a lignite seam that was mined during the mid‑20th century. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown coal is not an obvious birthplace for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0009281916300587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;iron oxalate&lt;/a&gt; crystals. The reason these yellow nodules formed in the Schwandorf brown coal is still unknown and will likely never be fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mining ended years ago, leaving no fresh outcrops to analyze, yet the rediscovered lumps instantly doubled Germany’s documented reserve of the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-microscopic-mineral-ehrigite-discovered-could-revolutionize-geological-exploration/"&gt;mineral&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their size, each roughly the volume of a hazelnut, also dwarfs the millimeter‑scale grains typically reported from other sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-proving-it-s-humboldtine"&gt;Proving it’s humboldtine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at the LfU laboratory, technicians ground a sliver and ran &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/x-ray-diffraction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;X‑ray diffraction&lt;/a&gt; on the powder. The diffractogram matched monoclinic humboldtine with textbook precision, ending any doubts raised by the old label. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another test showed the sample had the right mix of iron, carbon, oxygen, and water. Since it didn’t contain manganese, it couldn’t be mistaken for a similar mineral called lindbergite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are legally obligated to make geological collection pieces accessible to the public,” noted Eichhorn once the verdict came in. The verified samples will soon be displayed in the agency’s public gallery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-museum-drawer-to-lab"&gt;From museum drawer to lab&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond curiosity, humboldtine interests materials scientists because iron oxalates can shuttle electrons efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2019 study showed that a related oxalate compound stores charge through both iron and oxalate redox reactions, pointing to safer, high‑capacity cathodes for lithium‑ion batteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2021 paper by &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paula-Vehmaanperae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Paula Vehmaanperä&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues went further, describing how humboldtine precipitates when oxalic acid dissolves hematite at modest temperatures, suggesting a low‑energy synthesis route. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers now eye the mineral as a precursor for iron‑based battery anodes that avoid cobalt and nickel supply risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those industrial dreams hinge on reliable feedstocks, yet natural humboldtine remains vanishingly scarce. The Bavarian trove shows that museum drawers, not just mines, may hold the key to scaling future green technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-humboldt-s-legacy-in-modern-science"&gt;Humboldt’s legacy in modern science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mineral’s namesake, Alexander von Humboldt, wasn’t just a collector, he shaped the way we understand Earth’s interconnected systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His approach to mapping botanical zones by climate and geography laid the foundation for modern environmental science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humboldt’s influence stretches from volcanology to climate research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By naming humboldtine after him, scientists honored a thinker whose curiosity bridged &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/water-and-ice-may-reveal-where-rare-earth-elements-are-hiding/"&gt;minerals&lt;/a&gt;, organisms, and entire ecosystems, an approach still shaping how today’s researchers connect geology with global change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-catalogues-still-matter"&gt;Why catalogues still matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digitising legacy collections can expose overlooked pages, mislabelled crates, and minerals that vanished from the field generations ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Schwandorf find underscores how systematic record‑keeping lets modern analysts revisit twentieth‑century fieldwork with twenty‑first-century tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more agencies move their paper files online, Eichhorn predicts further surprises. Somewhere, another scribbled label may be waiting to reveal the next rare crystal, or the next leap for battery science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/clays-and-clay-minerals/article/formation-of-humboldtine-during-the-dissolution-of-hematite-in-oxalic-acid-density-functional-theory-dft-calculations-and-experimental-verification/83B6B7D7866F04A3291640014F8CF20A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clays and Clay Minerals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 15:21:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxNTVZKeU9aRWRVdFNNZkFJTjdORHV2Q3pqWnhScUtTcmU1eERBa2dFQkQ0SUZWN2ozZDhCcjE5My16TW1nSldqamlzS2R4S0dNZnJSbGUxNmpZMW5UaU4yVWNLdzR3QUtrUTJkZ2Nfc1daSTF3a09uUmkyX1RYLVRzREpVQzIwYUxZRzhWUklraHZWa2Y4blplQzlPYVk0MVlIWWVPaDEtWlRxME15a2ZHVU9GYUo</guid></item><item><title>格林伯格市长确认杰斐逊县首例麻疹病例- WHAS11 | Mayor Greenberg confirms first measles case in Jefferson County - WHAS11</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi5AFBVV95cUxOYXllQ19PblhqMnpPUTZWalRUMFpwUUE2eV9fV25SMjN0RWhJeldNLVMtcUx5NjN5MWJQMkRaZGw1YVd6T3ZydXFMWmR6WV9pQXRCOWpfWE9hY3I3OFQ4QkNfSkJDVmJpOE5vVWVNM1dacnpoMGFNQXYwY0dIc1huNDhJeDJJdjJZOXRwbW5BQ0VIeDlwWFl1SlNRRXVSRmJmb3k5OFlyNl9pSkVrOHZKSzFVbjE3eWQ2d2lLQUZiRGFySTBkNUwxcXhOVHFkTXprVmN0LVl6VGJKNDJnR2VxQ1hPMDg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;The mayor said Louisville health officials are doing contact tracing to find who may have been in contact with them.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOUISVILLE, Ky. — A case of the &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-central-kentucky-lexington/417-e2567188-2156-473b-b53c-4c63b5fa0f29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;measles &lt;/a&gt;has appeared in Jefferson County.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a news conference Tuesday, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said a child had traveled internationally to a country that has a measles outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first measles case to be confirmed in Jefferson County and the 13th case of measles in the Commonwealth in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norton Women's and Children's Hospital confirmed they saw the patient on July 12, and got the test results back late on July 14.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mayor said Louisville health officials are doing contact tracing to find who may have been in contact with them.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Public Health will tell those that they connect with through the contact tracing what to do, but there is a group of people who we will be asking to isolate," Greenberg said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mayor confirmed the case in Jefferson County is not related to the other active cases in the state; of those, 11 people were unvaccinated and one only person had one dose of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The health and safety of our community and residents are of my utmost importance,” Greenberg said. “Our team is working hard to prevent further spread in the community. I encourage everyone to check their vaccination status and get vaccinated if needed, as it is the most effective way to protect ourselves from this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The child's vaccination status is currently unknown, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;How do I know if I have measles?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus that can cause serious health complications, especially in young children. Measles is spread through the air and can remain suspended in the air for up to two hours. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms of measles begin eight to12 days after exposure and include high fever, cough, runny nose and red or watery eyes. The characteristic measles rash typically appears three to five days after symptoms begin, usually on the face before spreading down to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Health Strategist Connie Mendel said Tuesday if you believe you have the measles to call the doctor's office ahead of time so they can make special arrangements to see you.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Measles vaccine&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first dose of measles vaccine is routinely administered in combination with mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) to children at age 12 months through 15 months, and a second dose at age 4 through 6. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two doses of MMR vaccine is 97% effective against measles, according to the CDC. CDC recently issued a travel advisory to urge all people traveling outside of the U.S. to receive two doses of MMR vaccine if they have never had measles. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, immunization rates among Kentucky’s kindergartners have declined.  Results from the most recent school immunizations survey for the 2024-2025 school year indicate that only 86.9% of Kentucky kindergarteners are fully vaccinated against measles, which is lower than the national average of 93%. Two doses of MMR vaccine are required for school attendance in Kentucky.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kentucky’s first confirmed measles case of 2025 occurred in an adult resident in February. The second case occurred in March in a child who was traveling through the Commonwealth when they sought treatment.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Copper isn't normally what comes to mind when talking about healthy eating, but a new study links copper in the diets of older adults to better cognitive function – a significant finding for research into &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coffee-could-be-the-secret-to-healthy-aging-for-women-scientists-discover"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carried out by a team from Hebei Medical University in China, the study looked at diet and health data for 2,420 adults aged 60 or over in the US, finding there was a link between more copper in diets and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-4-key-factors-that-may-predict-cognitive-decline"&gt;better cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across multiple measures, those with more copper in their diets scored significantly higher than those with less – though there was also a threshold point above which more copper doesn't seem to bring additional benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-should-eat-more-of-these-8-healthy-foods-and-heres-why?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;8 Foods You Should Actually Eat More of: A Nutritionist Explains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The current study indicates a potential association between dietary copper intake and enhanced cognitive function in American older adults, particularly among those with a history of stroke," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-09280-9"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dose–response analysis suggested an optimal copper intake level, with an inflection point of approximately 1.22 milligrams per day. However, further longitudinal studies are necessary to confirm these findings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that gets at some key limitations of the study. Participants were asked to report everything they'd eaten in the last 24 hours, on two occasions, and the scientists estimated their copper intake from that. That only gives us a snapshot in time, and introduces potential biases from self-reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate further, studies would need to follow participants over several years, and measure their copper intake more carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, we can't say there's a direct &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"&gt;cause and effect&lt;/a&gt; relationship here. However, the relationship is statistically strong enough to warrant further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167687" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167687" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/CopperChart.jpg" alt="Copper analysis" class="wp-image-167687 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/CopperChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/CopperChart-600x387.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167687" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers charted copper intake against cognition test results. (Jia et al., &lt;em&gt;Sci. Rep.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, it fits with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-022-01802-5"&gt;earlier studies&lt;/a&gt; that came to the same conclusion: copper is good for the brain. We know that it helps &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2014.00143"&gt;neuron communication&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232213850"&gt;energy production&lt;/a&gt; in the brain, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2008.09.039"&gt;protects against damage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, the study results aren't surprising. However, they do help quantify the benefits of copper across a relatively large group of older people, and several different &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-test-could-tell-if-you-have-early-signs-of-dementia-with-high-accuracy"&gt;cognitive tests&lt;/a&gt; – and identify a 'sweet spot' for copper intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Though copper is necessary for proper functioning of the brain, and deficiencies can lead to neurological disorders, excessive copper can be toxic, leading to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-09280-9"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1.22 mg per day is the equivalent of a handful of walnuts or a bowl of lentils. Copper is found in more foods &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/nutrition/copper-in-diet"&gt;than you might think&lt;/a&gt; – including mushrooms, dark chocolate, wheat bran, and oysters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15245116"&gt;an increasing amount of interest&lt;/a&gt; in micronutrients such as magnesium, iron, selenium, zinc, and copper, and how they might be important in keeping brains sharp as people enter the later years of their lives. This is on top of what studies have already discovered about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-30-year-study-may-have-found-the-single-best-diet-for-healthy-aging"&gt;diets and healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, what we eat &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-pinpointed-the-best-diets-to-boost-healthy-aging"&gt;plays a major role&lt;/a&gt; in how healthy our brains are – though diet is far from the only factor involved. Research like this can lead the way towards improvements in preventions and treatments for the brain problems that tend to come with old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the increase in the aging global aging population, the prevalence of cognitive impairment is also escalating," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-09280-9"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All forms of dementia, ranging from mild cognitive impairment to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="167684" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, are marked by cognitive decline and are increasingly emerging as a significant global public health challenge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-09280-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

NAD plus is a compound that naturally exists in your body and is responsible for keeping your skin looking youthful. However, as you age, its levels decrease, so it stands to reason that a supplement could help counteract that. Many people have taken to &lt;a target="_self" data-id="1cb5538c-653f-4fe5-8d5f-10900990eece" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/45PlusSkincare/comments/1h4u0km/has_anyone_tried_nad/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; to inquire about the potential skin care effects of this supplement, particularly for more mature skin. But will taking a NAD plus supplement actually make a difference in your skin and overall health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;No &lt;a target="_self" data-id="b2d4d030-ce4c-4208-85a7-79153a17ca86" href="https://www.cnet.com/health/biological-age-chronological-age-do-anti-aging-hacks-do-anything/"&gt;anti-aging method&lt;/a&gt; is foolproof, which is why we consulted doctors and experts to understand what exactly NAD plus is, how supplements can help the body's aging process and whether these supplements are safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="f5a64693-4cee-49c0-8063-81817a5cf533" data-cy="shortcodeListicle" data-id="listicle-f5a64693-4cee-49c0-8063-81817a5cf533" data-location="LIST" data-position="1" class="c-shortcodeListicle g-border-thin-light-top g-inner-spacing-bottom-medium g-inner-spacing-left-large g-inner-spacing-right-large g-inner-spacing-bottom-xlarge c-shortcodeListicle-notInfoCard g-outer-spacing-bottom-large g-border-thin-light-bottom g-border-thin-light-right g-border-thin-light-left"&gt; &lt;div class="c-shortcodeListicle_text"&gt;     &lt;div class="c-shortcodeListicle_dek c-shortcodeListicleDek c-shortcodeListicleDek-inline g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAD plus supplements may help improve cognitive function, boost energy and metabolism, support heart health and slow the aging process. Research is still limited and more is needed to understand the long-term effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="49f08103-a2b4-43c1-83fe-dd6a1924c06c" data-ng-block="{"&gt;What is NAD plus and what does it do in the body? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAD plus -- nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide -- is a coenzyme found in all living cells that keeps "everything running smoothly," explains &lt;a data-id="36018e2d-ad6f-46be-9907-e0ac6f84e2ec" href="https://www.facialartistrymd.com/" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Konstantin Vasyukevich&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based facial plastic surgeon who often discusses aging with patients. It "creates energy and repairs DNA" and also regulates your circadian rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is also involved in the function of sirtuins, proteins that help regulate cell survival and aging processes," said Nayan Patel, a doctor of pharmacy and founder of &lt;a data-id="b98a82d9-b90a-4400-a2ce-7621d854550f" href="https://aurowellness.com/" target="_self"&gt;Auro Wellness&lt;/a&gt;. The coenzyme slightly differs from NADH, which you may also see while looking for NAD plus supplements. NAD plus is oxidized, while NADH is reduced, which basically means NAD plus has an extra electron and when it loses it, it becomes NADH.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAD plus is naturally found in the body, but as you age, your levels drop, which can lead to tiredness and skin aging, Vasyukevich says. An NAD plus supplement can help combat this, as can a vitamin B3 supplement. Although vitamin B3 is not the same as NAD plus, your body converts vitamin B3 into NAD plus, so these extra supplements can also help your NAD plus levels.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="38549039-8444-4991-9c45-77c7329c63a0" data-ng-block="{"&gt;NAD plus benefits &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary benefit of NAD plus, and, in turn, an NAD plus supplement, is that it's an energy booster. Studies -- including &lt;a target="_self" data-id="42ecc3fe-5411-44f8-a808-59060288463b" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10692436/"&gt;this one from 2023&lt;/a&gt; -- have shown that the coenzyme helps with weight management and balances metabolism, as pointed out by Vasyukevich. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[NAD plus] can do a few cool things," he says. "It can help with skin health by promoting DNA repair and fighting oxidative stress, which is a big reason skin ages. It can also give you more energy by helping your cells make more [adenosine triphosphate or ATP] -- that's the energy your body runs on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Daniel Llao Calvet/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="41f0d370-f007-4a34-910a-4a1c57dcc08e" data-ng-block="{"&gt;NAD plus side effects &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-id="021c9330-e0c6-4be3-926e-474eb0cf0d6e" href="https://www.medicalofficesofmanhattan.com/our-team/dr-jonathan-jennings/" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Jonathan Jennings&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified internist with Medical Offices of Manhattan and contributor to &lt;a data-id="021c9330-e0c6-4be3-926e-474eb0cf0d6e" href="https://www.labfinder.com" target="_self"&gt;Lab Finder&lt;/a&gt;, tells CNET that NAD plus supplements are mostly viewed as safe -- but as with any change to your health-care routine, you always want to approach with caution. Especially considering that the Food and Drug Administration does not regulate supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most data suggests all versions are safe in most populations and side effect profiles depend on the mode of supplementation," he says, noting that side effects for the supplement in pill form can differ from those when you take it intravenously, for example. "Common side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness and flushing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another common side effect, Vasyukevich says, is an interruption to your sleeping pattern. He says this can happen if you take the supplement too late in the day, which can generally be corrected by changing when you take it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both doctors, as well as Patel, recommend speaking with your health-care provider before starting an NAD plus supplement, as well as if you experience any side effects. If you experience any side effects, you should stop taking the supplement immediately. It may be interacting with another one of your medications or you may even have an allergy to it. You also may have an intolerance to it. This will be up to you and your doctor to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="942b3a2a-c682-4b5c-8e12-0cb67d00aeb1" data-ng-block="{"&gt;Who should avoid NAD plus supplements? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While NAD plus supplements are largely viewed as safe, Jennings cautions that they aren't for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is important to consult your health professional prior to supplementation because safety has not been confirmed for certain populations such as pregnant [people] and children," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patel also recommends that people who are nursing avoid NAD plus supplements, as there's not enough research on these products. He also advises anyone interested in taking the supplement to discuss it with their doctor, as he wouldn't recommend it for people on certain medications or with specific medical conditions, although he did not specify which because that should be left up to each patient and their health-care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a data-id="9154310f-74d4-45c1-a6c0-56e73ed520ea" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/10/5/687" target="_self"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; showed, however, that NAD plus supplements could have adverse effects on those with existing liver or kidney problems because of how the supplement is metabolized. "Factors like age, genetic makeup, diet and health conditions can affect the body's response to supplementation," Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;RealPeopleGroup/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="9a579624-59ca-4a19-94cb-913e845a31f5" data-ng-block="{"&gt;Do NAD plus supplements actually work to slow down aging? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts and studies believe these supplements can positively affect people if used properly and at a dose recommended by a medical professional. Vasyukevich cautions, though, that they're not a "magic fix" to reverse the aging process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"NAD plus supplements can help by boosting the body's repair systems, which may reduce wrinkles and other signs of aging over time," he says. "They won't completely stop aging but they could help your cells stay healthier and function better, which might slow things down a little."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patel tells CNET that these supplements are still actively being studied. While some research shows that they can help improve the appearance of skin or give people more energy, he believes more clinical trials are "necessary" to fully establish efficacy in "aging prevention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also stresses that these supplements should never be used as a replacement for healthy habits, as those are some of the best ways to keep your body youthful as you continue to age. "Exercise, good nutrition, adequate sleep and &lt;a data-id="f053aeaf-f799-4ace-a304-96bc5e24d74e" href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/7-stress-relieving-tactics-that-will-help-you-reach-your-carefree-era/" target="_self"&gt;stress management&lt;/a&gt; are crucial for overall well-being," he says, adding that if you're going to try the supplements, take care in choosing them. They're not all equally effective and it's important to pick one that's high-quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="3143ebf2-0d8d-4080-876a-a2e2284d1af0" data-ng-block="{"&gt;NAD plus supplement dose and can you take it daily? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are different methods of supplementation which include oral, nasal, intramuscular and intravenous versions," Jennings said. Studies have been done on how supplements work in the body, although findings are limited.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patel tells CNET that nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide supplements have been studied and have been shown to improve the aging process but should be approached "with caution." Both types of supplements, also known as NAD plus precursors, are natural compounds that can &lt;a data-id="d5178451-7f28-4f01-af81-45bcb21e3700" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5842119/#:~:text=(A)%20Nicotinamide%20mononucleotide%20(NMN,are%20independent%20of%20catalytic%20activity." target="_self"&gt;enhance the production&lt;/a&gt; of NAD plus within the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a data-id="60e50af1-e2bc-408e-8784-e0660290be61" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10692436/#s17" target="_self"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; of nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide oral supplementation reported some improvement in "cardiovascular, metabolic and physical function" in those who participated. This study looked at several groups of people who had been given different doses of a supplement for various periods of time to analyze the efficacy and safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being said, the dose that is right for you largely depends on what you discuss with your health-care provider. It also depends on the method you choose for supplementation. Most supplements in pill or nasal form can be taken daily but your doctor can advise you on what's best and adjust as needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Tetra Images/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a319ec0e-0d8f-4883-b126-8310c29ab0e2" data-ng-block="{"&gt;Other ways to increase NAD plus levels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking an NAD plus supplement isn't the only way to boost your body's NAD plus levels.

"Regular exercise has been shown to boost NAD plus levels by stimulating the production of NAD plus precursors," he says. "Additionally, lifestyle choices like adequate sleep hygiene and stress management can positively affect NAD plus levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you eat can also affect your NAD plus levels, especially if you reach for foods rich in vitamin B3 and niacin, which are precursors for NAD Plus (meaning the body turns them into NAD plus). Foods rich in vitamin B3 and niacin include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-ng-block="{" id&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beef&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Broccoli&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cabbage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dairy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fish&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fruit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Peanuts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seeds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turkey&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole grains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="aaf0df05-9bb7-4d46-a912-e987e50f01dc" data-ng-block="{"&gt;The bottom line &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we age, the body's naturally occurring coenzyme NAD plus decreases, leading to tiredness and skin aging.
