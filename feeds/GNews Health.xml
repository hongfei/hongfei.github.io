&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;To vape or not to vape?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That is the question sparking a heated debate this week in Geneva where over 1,400 delegates have gathered to discuss the World Health Organization's Tobacco Control Treaty and what they call "the tobacco epidemic."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For years, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/12/16/788597890/new-study-offers-first-evidence-of-vapings-long-term-risks" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stories&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; warning about the dangers of vapes, also known as e-cigarettes, and other non-cigarette products like heated tobacco and nicotine pouches.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many scientists and public health experts point out that the tobacco industry promotes and profits from these newer products and that many young non-smokers are using e-cigarettes and becoming addicted to nicotine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;However, a number of doctors, scientists and public health experts argue that, while these products are dangerous, they may not be as dangerous as traditional cigarettes, which &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tobacco" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;kill up to half&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of long-term users. As the lesser of two evils, their argument goes, e-cigarettes could be useful in helping people quit smoking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This matters because even though smoking rates have been dropping, 1.2 billion people worldwide continue to use tobacco. About 80% of them live in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Accusations of industry influence and scientific censorship are flying.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;WHO staked out its stance on the issue this month in a strongly worded &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/who-position-on-tobacco-control-and-harm-reduction" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;position paper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; slamming the idea of using e-cigarettes as a tool in smoking cessation. And at the anti-tobacco gathering in Geneva, leaders are calling for tough new restrictions on products like vapes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both sides agree that getting this question right now is key to addressing the tobacco epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Mea culpa!"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago, Dr. Derek Yach was well regarded in the public health world.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The South African physician played a leading role in drafting and launching WHO's landmark tobacco treaty. And the treaty has played a critical role in reducing tobacco use, which has dropped by a third largely due to strategies like health warnings, taxation and bans on advertising.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But now? Yach acknowledges he's a pariah to many former colleagues. "I'm excommunicated," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's because of his stance on e-cigarettes, heated tobacco and the like.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yach has come to believe that the traditional approach to smoking cessation is insufficient. "There was only one message allowed and still is today: The only way to get rid of smoking is to get everybody to quit," he says, arguing that this approach doesn't "recognize the toughness that people go through with a complex addiction, which is driven by nicotine."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In many other areas of medicine, the idea of "harm reduction" is well established. For example, public health programs provide sterile needles to drug users so they don't spread HIV and hepatitis. It reduces the harm, even if it doesn't solve the addiction. Yach sees e-cigarettes as a method of harm reduction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While products like e-cigarettes still have nicotine, it is not burned. Instead, a heating element converts a nicotine liquid into a vapor that is inhaled.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's in the process of burning that you create the cancer-causing agents and many of the other toxins that eventually cause the death and disease," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yach wants to see these products promoted by doctors and health programs as a way to help current smokers cut back on smoking or quit altogether. He remembers thinking to himself: "Mea culpa! I've missed what is probably the greatest opportunity to save lives."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yach eventually founded the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World, to advocate for this approach. It's since been renamed Global Action to End Smoking and is under new leadership.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's an important point to note about this group. It's funded by the tobacco industry. That connection has cemented his self-described excommunication.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Yach is not a lone voice. &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/quit-smoking/using-e-cigarettes-to-stop-smoking/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The U.K&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.'s National Health Service, for example, has embraced e-cigarettes as a way to help people stop smoking. And a number of academics — independent of the tobacco industry — have come to agree with him. Mike Cummings, a professor and researcher at the Medical University of South Carolina, is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Cummings does not want non-smokers to use e-cigarettes or the other products — but he also stresses that "for somebody who is already addicted to nicotine in cigarettes, having an alternative that would be safer, like an e-cigarette, is something that's worth considering."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because of his call for a debate, Cummings says, he's been shunned by many in the world of tobacco control. He says the fact that he's testified against tobacco companies in court more than 200 times hasn't saved him from being on the outs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"One of the ways they have attacked us is to claim that we're shills for the cigarette companies, which is absurd. We're not," Cummings says. "Many of us are legitimate scientists."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says an open debate hasn't happened yet — and that it can be hard to get funding for research into smoking harm reduction strategies. "That's not science. That's anti-science. It's censorship," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the largest tobacco companies, Phillip Morris International, declined an interview request from NPR but said in a statement that WHO shouldn't fear dialogue and is out of step with governments that are embracing smoke-free products in order to end smoking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Mass marketing harmful products"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to the idea of harm reduction, WHO is adamant in its opposition. Its &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/who-position-on-tobacco-control-and-harm-reduction" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;position paper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says the tobacco industry is "misappropriating" the medical term harm reduction and "mass marketing harmful products" while "cloaking" it in medical language.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Let's be clear, the companies that make these products are not motivated by harm reduction or health, they are motivated by one thing and one thing only: generating profit," says WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. "There is no evidence of their net benefit for public health, but mounting evidence of their harm."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One major concern in this debate is that the products are often used by non-smokers — especially young ones who are attracted by the flavors and packaging.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We see use rates [of e-cigarettes] among children nine times higher than among adults," says Benn McGrady. He heads Public Health Law and Policies at WHO, which helps governments develop and defend tobacco laws. "The latest data that we have shows there are 15 million children worldwide using e-cigarettes."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;McGrady worries that, without proper regulations, there could be a generation of people newly addicted to nicotine. WHO argues that countries need to regulate the products at least as strictly as cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Last month, the International Pediatric Association also came out forcefully against e-cigarettes, warning in the medical journal &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/156/5/e2025072337/204538/E-Cigarettes-and-the-Nicotine-Epidemic-Statement?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;/a&gt;"e-cigarette use is associated with cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, oral diseases and cancer, with dual users facing greater health risks than cigarette smokers alone." The stakes, their position paper says, are high: "E-cigarettes threaten to reverse decades of progress in tobacco control."&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's the opposite of harm reduction, right? That's really harm-causing," says &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/stella.bialous" target="_blank"&gt;Stella Bialous&lt;/a&gt;, the associate director for Global Tobacco Control Initiatives at the University of California, San Francisco's Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One concern that's surfaced has been &lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2025/07/16/disposable-e-cigarettes-study" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;exposure to metals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — like lead — in the heating element of the e-cigarette. However, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41254430/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have pointed in both &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38411454/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;directions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to exactly how risky these new products are, McGrady says, there's huge variation between the various products and it's "not responsible" to generalize. These products are relatively new and WHO's report acknowledges their risks will only become clear over time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"An unutterable scam"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For some, this debate feels like déjà vu — and a classic example of the tobacco industry interfering in public health efforts and sowing division.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bialous says many researchers believe that this debate is "actually one of the strategies that a tobacco company developed to divide and conquer — like 'let's talk about harm reduction and get all the people fighting among themselves while we continue to sell the products.'"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Tim McAfee is the former head of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Office on Smoking and Health — which has now been eliminated by President Trump. He says this current battle reminds him of when the industry promoted filtered cigarettes as safer in the 1950s and when they pushed low-tar cigarettes in the '60s and '70s.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Every single one of those things they've done over the last 100 years has turned out to be an unutterable scam," he says. He calls the effort to promote e-cigarettes and similar products a smokescreen.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cummings, the professor at Medical University of South Carolina, counters that just because these newer products are backed by the tobacco industry doesn't automatically mean they can't play a role in smoking reduction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We ought to get the evidence and weigh it and debate it — and help guide the policies based on evidence, not on ideology," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

For people in the US, the UK and Australia, these foods make up &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/nov/19/australia-ultra-processed-foods-consumption-rate-upf-lancet" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more than half the calories they consume each day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But it’s not always easy to tell which foods are ultra-processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The term was coined &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19366466/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;in 2009&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at the University of São Paulo, as part of their &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/ultraprocessed-foods-what-they-are-and-how-to-identify-them/E6D744D714B1FF09D5BCA3E74D53A185" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nova food classification system&lt;/a&gt; that sorts foods into four groups:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Group one: unprocessed or minimally processed foods including whole fruits and vegetables, milk, oats and rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Group two: processed basic ingredients used in cooking including salt, sugar and vegetable oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Group three: processed foods made by adding items from groups one and two. Includes canned legumes, bread and cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Group four: ultra-processed foods which are commercial products made from extracts of foods, often with added chemicals, flavours and other ingredients you wouldn’t find in a home kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While there can be health harms from an unbalanced diet of foods in any of the groups – for example, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/24/the-truth-about-salt-how-to-avoid-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-hidden-killers" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;those containing too much salt&lt;/a&gt; – researchers say the problem with group four is that the processes used to make them and the industrial ingredients they contain mean they are not “real food” and are more likely to cause health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But they can be hard to spot. A long ingredients list with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;names you don’t recognise (hello maltodextrin and soy lecithin) is a giveaway for ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you’re unsure, the &lt;a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Open Food Facts&lt;/a&gt; app lets you search for products and see their category.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;As the U.S. continues to face its &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5461155/measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccination-health" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;worst&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; measles outbreak in three decades, another country that has struggled with measles offers a telling case study: the eastern European nation of Romania.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While most countries hardest hit by measles are lower-income countries in the Global South, wealthier countries have also seen significant outbreaks. Romania is one of them. The country ranked &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/measles-reported-cases-and-incidence?GROUP=Countries&amp;amp;YEAR=" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fifth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the measles outbreak list last year, reporting 30,692 cases and &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/MEAS-AER-2024-Report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;23 deaths&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Aurora Stanescu, an epidemiologist at the National Institute for Public Health in Romania, five of those deaths were children under age 1.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Schwalbe calls those figures a "wake-up call."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's a lot of cases of measles, and that's a lot of deaths from a disease that really shouldn't be killing anybody at this point," Schwalbe says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Unlike many lower-resource countries where measles &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/measles-reported-cases-and-incidence?GROUP=Countries&amp;amp;YEAR=" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;takes a toll&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan and Yemen — Romania is an upper-middle-income country and part of the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even now, the consequences of low vaccine rates linger. The country &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/06/03/measles-in-europe-where-are-cases-of-one-of-the-most-contagious-diseases-rising" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;continues&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to report measles cases in 2025. However, initial tallies are significantly lower than those of last year. According to public health specialists in Romania, the current numbers reflect how measles &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/v17060755" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;tends&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to come in waves.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Amid a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/13/1231104444/the-anti-vaccine-movement" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;growing trend&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of vaccine hesitancy around the world, Romania's experience paints a cautionary tale.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An authoritarian past&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The outbreaks aren't only a matter of poverty and not understanding the importance of immunization," says Dr. Mihai Craiu, a pediatrician at Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Romania. "It's multifactorial."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the forces driving the measles surge is Romania's political transition. Under the repressive Communist government that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/12/24/369593135/25-years-after-death-a-dictator-still-casts-a-shadow-in-romania" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ruled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for more than four decades, vaccines for childhood diseases were required.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Immunizations were &lt;a href="https://romania.europalibera.org/a/doctor-mihai-craiu-fake-news-medicina-vaccinare-stiinta-dezinformare/33569279.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;given&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to kids at school without parental consent, Craiu says. "Virtually all children were immunized," he recalls.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Prevention of infectious diseases by vaccination were ideal terrains in which the Communist state could demonstrate its power and legitimate its authority," historian Dora Vargha &lt;a href="https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.7765/9781526110916.00010/html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;wrote&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in a book about vaccines. "If vaccination worked, the result would be immediate and visible."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00050221.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;introduced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 1979. The result: a 90% reduction in cases, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00050221.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;according&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to a report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And an immunization rate above 95%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's the magic number for measles. "If 95% of people are vaccinated, the measles virus can't find a home for itself in those people, and eventually it gives up," Schwalbe says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then came political — and vaccine — upheaval. When Romania &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/1999/11/05/1066228/the-collapse-of-communism" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;adopted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a democratic form of government in 1989, citizens gained more freedom — including the ability to decline the recommended but no longer mandatory vaccine.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Like others in post-Communist countries, Romanians &lt;a href="https://www.culturaldiplomacy.org/academy/content/articles/symposium2010/participant-papers/Simona_Vasilache_-_Romania.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;grew&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; more distrustful of their government — and the immunizations it was recommending. This laid the foundation for anti-vaccine groups to step in and take advantage of the public mindset.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Part of the perception of democracy in Romania was the liberty of not obeying the rules," Craiu says, noting that some Romanians view immunization as a form of Communist-era state control. When Romanians refuse vaccines, he says it's their way of asserting independence after decades of authoritarian leadership.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The impact of an HPV vaccine campaign&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But vaccine refusal wasn't just about asserting personal freedom. People began doubting the benefits of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This decline [in vaccination] is partly due to decreased public confidence in vaccination benefits, reflected in parental refusal to vaccinate their children," &lt;a href="https://insp.gov.ro/download/analiza-bolilor-transmisibile-aflate-in-supraveghere-raport-pentru-anul-2024/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;read&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a report published in October by Romania's National Institute for Public Health — their equivalent of the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This trend was exacerbated by growing skepticism about vaccines, exacerbated by the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X12013266" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2008 campaign&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to vaccinate girls against HPV, the virus that can &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5323229/hpv-vaccine-cancer-rfk" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cause&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cervical cancer. That campaign deepened public skepticism about all vaccines, as &lt;a href="https://rtsa.ro/tras/index.php/tras/article/view/195/191" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;headlines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from various Romanian media outlets demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;At the time of the HPV vaccine rollout, measles vaccine coverage stood at the recommended 95% rate. In subsequent years, it declined steadily, &lt;a href="https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/wuenic-trends/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dropping&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by 20 percentage points by 2017 and further declining to just 62% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A study conducted by Stanescu and her colleagues last year &lt;a href="https://insp.gov.ro/download/analiza-rezultatelor-estimarii-acoperirii-vaccinale-cu-2-doze-rro-la-5-ani-si-cu-1-doza-dtpa-la-14-ani_februarie-2024/?wpdmdl=127363&amp;amp;refresh=68f9bc5de5a3c1761197149" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;found&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that only one of Romania's more than 40 regions had measles vaccine coverage above 95%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The pandemic exacerbated that sharp nosedive in vaccine coverage, the National Institute for Public Health report observes, noting disruptions in routine vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As the share of those protected against measles decreased, &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/measles-reported-cases-and-incidence?CODE=ROU&amp;amp;YEAR=" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;outbreaks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pummeled the country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Some saw the outbreaks in the 2010s as a wake-up call, but others didn't," says Dr. Gindrovel Dumitra, the vice president of the Romanian National Society of Family Medicine. "Some people simply refuse vaccines — and even an outbreak won't convince them."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A health system struggles to keep up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Along with Romania's growing anti-vaccine movement, the country faces systemic barriers that contribute to its low vaccination rates. Dumitra points to three main factors: a &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/11/21/romanias-health-care-system-the-eus-worst-struggles-to-reform" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fragile health system&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that remains one of the most &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Healthcare_expenditure_statistics_-_overview" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;underfunded&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Europe, a &lt;a href="https://human-resources-health.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12960-025-00985-6" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;shrinking&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; number of primary care providers — driven by burnout and low compensation —&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11598722/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;absence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of mandatory immunization policies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lack of funding for health care &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/27-08-2025-new-study-exposes-barriers-to-childhood-vaccination-in-romanian-communities" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;disproportionately affects&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; minority groups like the country's &lt;a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/roma-eu/roma-equality-inclusion-and-participation-eu-country/romania_en" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;nearly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 2 million Roma people. Minorities are often blamed for low vaccination rates, but Craiu says a deeper look reveals that the problem stems from inadequate outreach and lack of access to care.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you don't have a family doctor in your village, then first of all, it's difficult to get information and then it's also difficult to access vaccines," says Dr. Silvia Gatscher, the health operations manager at the World Health Organization Country Office in Romania.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As the years passed, the clergy &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/vaccines-carry-tiny-knives-cut-veins-inside-romanias-toxic-anti/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;became&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-024-20133-4" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;influential&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/world/europe/romania-president-election-simion-trump.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;advocating&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; against vaccines — some say as a reaction to the government &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21567689.2022.2080669" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;limiting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; church services during the early years of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, far-right politicians &lt;a href="https://cepa.org/article/romanias-elections-a-victory-for-medical-populism/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;capitalized&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on growing mistrust toward vaccines. One of those anti-vaccine lawmakers is Diana Sosoaca. She said, "God is not vaccinated" during a &lt;a href="https://spotmedia.ro/en/news/politics/romanian-mep-sosoaca-anti-vaccine-circus-in-the-european-parliament-until-her-microphone-was-cut-off-god-is-not-vaccinated-in-romania-88-are-not-vaccinated" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;brief speech&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the floor of the European Parliament last year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A free fall in immunization coverage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Currently, only two-thirds of Romanians are fully vaccinated against measles. That's the &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/measles-vaccination-coverage?GROUP=Countries&amp;amp;ANTIGEN=MCV2&amp;amp;YEAR=&amp;amp;CODE=" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lowest&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; measles vaccination rate in the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The shortfall has serious consequences. Researchers &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2016.1787" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;estimate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that one person who contracts the virus can infect up to 18 unvaccinated people nearby. The risk is especially dire for children too young to have completed the two-dose vaccination protocol, which is &lt;a href="https://vaccine-schedule.ecdc.europa.eu/Scheduler/ByCountry?SelectedCountryId=170&amp;amp;IncludeChildAgeGroup=true&amp;amp;IncludeChildAgeGroup=false&amp;amp;IncludeAdultAgeGroup=true&amp;amp;IncludeAdultAgeGroup=false" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;administered&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; first at 12 months and then again at age 5.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That includes babies like Ionela Radulescu's son. Last year, the 7-month-old was hospitalized for pneumonia and came into contact with a child infected with measles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"He had a rash on his face. It was pinkish and very small," the 31-year-old mother says through an interpreter. "Then it started going down onto his chest and palms. It even went down to the soles of his feet. He had it everywhere."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Radulescu lives in Suceava, in northern Romania. Last year, the area &lt;a href="https://insp.gov.ro/download/analiza-bolilor-transmisibile-aflate-in-supraveghere-raport-pentru-anul-2024/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;recorded&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the sixth-highest rate of measles cases among more than 40 regions. The frequency of cases in Suceava &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwaf167" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;mirrored&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; levels seen in countries before the measles vaccine became widely available.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Although her son was too young to be vaccinated, the mother says: "I felt bad. It was very hard. I started questioning myself and asking questions like, Was I too negligent? Was I not careful enough? You start to blame yourself. It's a really ugly feeling."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And measles can be far more than an uncomfortable rash. The virus can &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra2504516" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lead to&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pneumonia, eye inflammation, diarrhea and ear infections, which can result in deafness in approximately 5 to 10% of cases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even after recovering from the illness, children remain at risk for a rare and fatal complication called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. It typically &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560673/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;appears&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about seven to 10 years after the initial infection. Stanescu estimates there have been about a dozen cases in Romania in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Just because you're OK from that infection at the time doesn't mean that that infection doesn't have very serious consequences for you later in life," Schwalbe explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A different way to talk to parents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While Craiu and Dumitra admit it's an uphill battle, they've taken an evidence-based approach to combating misinformation and encouraging vaccination. "It's a huge difference in what we learned in medical school and what I'm doing now," Craiu explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When speaking with parents, Dumitra &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/ppa.s500640" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;uses motivational interviewing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a technique that helps patients adopt changes when they decide the change matters to them — not because a doctor said so. It also encourages physicians to listen without judgment, exploring a patient's ambivalence. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2023-065483" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics praises the method&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as an effective way to improve communication about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Yesterday, when I recommended a woman to be vaccinated against the flu, she told me, 'I'm scared of the vaccine.' I asked her, 'Why?'" Dumitra recalls.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The woman explained she was worried the vaccine would worsen a chronic illness. "After acknowledging her concerns, I offered her information and then verified if she understood it. She eventually got vaccinated."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lessons from Romania's outbreaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Gatscher is optimistic that evidence-based approaches to vaccine hesitancy will chip away at the mistrust and misinformation surrounding vaccines in her country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yet the global measles count this year indicates that other relatively well-off countries aren't drawing any lessons from Romania. This month, Canada &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2025/11/statement-from-the-public-health-agency-of-canada-on-canadas-measles-elimination-status.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lost&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; its measles elimination status due to sustained transmission, &lt;a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;with&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 5,000 cases so far this year. The U.S. has confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;1,723 cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2025 so far, according to the CDC — the highest annual number &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5461155/measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccination-health" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in more than three decades&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the U.S. has much to learn from what has happened in Romania, Schwalbe says America exists in its "own bubble" and often looks away from examples like Romania.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I think we are incredibly good in America at thinking, 'That's what's happening over there, and it has nothing to do with us,'" Schwalbe says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I don't think that Romania will teach us any lessons, unfortunately, even though it's such a clear lesson. The lesson to everybody — all over the world — is that when you lose high coverage of [vaccination against] measles, the disease comes back."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michal Ruprecht is a Stanford Global Health Media Fellow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This message &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/20/nx-s1-5615040/cdc-rfk-childhood-vaccines-autism" target="_blank"&gt;aligns with Health Secretary Robert F.

                The CDC has made a dramatic about-face in the agency's position on the relationship between vaccines and autism.

   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧&lt;strong&gt; CDC scientists say they didn't change their website&lt;/strong&gt;, and the Department of Health and Human Services wouldn't divulge who ordered the adjustment to the wording, NPR's Pien Huang tells &lt;em&gt;Up First&lt;/em&gt;. There is &lt;a href="https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5616178:x" target="_blank"&gt;no new scientific evidence to support the claim&lt;/a&gt; of a link between vaccines and autism. Huang notes that it is interesting that a headline on the CDC's webpage still states that vaccines don't cause autism. However, there is an asterisk next to this statement, which explains that the agency will not remove it due to an agreement with Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who provided a key confirmation vote for Kennedy to become the HHS secretary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President Trump's chief negotiator has presented a new 28-point plan for peace to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.&lt;/strong&gt; International observers are encouraged that Trump has not given up on peace between Ukraine and Russia, but the proposal requires major territorial concessions from Ukraine, which the country has repeatedly rejected. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧 &lt;strong&gt;The Trump administration continues to suggest these concessions because the president is focused on getting a yes to his plan&lt;/strong&gt;, says NPR's Franco Ordoñez. Russian analyst Sam Charap notes that for Trump, the details don't matter as much. He simply wants the fighting to come to an end, unlike the leaders of Russia and Ukraine, who are &lt;a href="https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5616178:x" target="_blank"&gt;more focused on the details&lt;/a&gt;. Russia desires more strategic territory, while Ukraine has been adamant on security guarantees from Washington and its Western allies to ensure this type of invasion doesn't happen again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump will meet with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani at the White House's Oval Office today. &lt;/strong&gt;This will mark the first time the two will meet face-to-face. Mamdani, a 34-year-old Democratic socialist, emerged as a national figure after his primary win earlier this year. The &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/21/nx-s1-5615169/trump-mamdani-oval-office-communist-socialist" target="_blank"&gt;president has called Mamdani a "communist"&lt;/a&gt; on social media and repeatedly sought to paint him as too radical for the city that elected him mayor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧 &lt;strong&gt;The meeting is a reminder of the shift Mamdani has to make as he steps into the new role&lt;/strong&gt;, says NPR's Elena Moore. The mayor-elect has a background as an activist, but today will be a &lt;a href="https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5616178:x" target="_blank"&gt;test for him in balancing his policy priorities&lt;/a&gt; and maintaining political diplomacy. As a reminder, Moore says, the president vowed to cut New York's federal funding if Mamdani won the election, so the meeting comes with real stakes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State and local voting officials from both major political parties are actively preparing for the possibility of the Trump administration's interference&lt;/strong&gt; in the midterm elections, which are less than a year away. The president has consistently spread false claims about voting in the U.S. In the spring, he issued an executive order aimed at imposing significant changes to election systems. Although courts have largely blocked the order, he has hinted at the possibility of taking other executive action as well. The election community is concerned that Trump plans to have a heavy hand in their processes next year. Here are a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/21/nx-s1-5599934/2026-trump-midterm-election-ballots-voting-national-guard" target="_blank"&gt;few things voting officials are watching for&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Deep dive&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-97821" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;The planet has warmed about 1.3 degrees Celsius, according to the World Meteorological Organization. Communities are already experiencing more severe storms, flooding, and heatwaves. Scientists warn that when the planet heats up beyond 1.5 degrees, there could be massive, self-reinforcing changes that could have devastating impacts worldwide. These changes are sometimes referred to as climate tipping points. They can unfold over decades or centuries and may be partially reversible. But they all have enormous and lasting implications for life on Earth. Here are some of the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/19/nx-s1-5593087/climate-tipping-points-cop30-brazil-coral-glaciers-carbon" target="_blank"&gt;most important and well-studied changes&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;💧 Coral reefs have been dying around the globe. They are very sensitive to heat, and their loss would destabilize many countries. Numerous people rely on them for food, income and livelihoods. Marine life that can only be found on these reefs would be at risk of extinction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;💧 Ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica could melt and result in the rise of sea levels around the world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;💧 Permanently frozen ground in the Arctic is thawing, which can cause the land to sink, resulting in cracks in the foundations of buildings, buckling of roads and the kinking of pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay up-to-date with the latest news&lt;/strong&gt; from the COP30, the United Nations climate meeting in Brazil, with this &lt;a href="https://app.npr.org/curatedplaylist/changingplanet" target="_blank"&gt;app-exclusive playlist of stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet over the past three decades, the bacterium's resistance to oral antibiotics has been growing and spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/powerful-new-antibiotic-was-hiding-in-plain-sight-for-decades"&gt;Powerful New Antibiotic Was 'Hiding in Plain Sight' For Decades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study, scientists from multiple countries sequenced the genomes of 3,489 S Typhi strains contracted from 2014 to 2019 in Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India, and found a rise in extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Typhi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the study:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XDR Typhi is not only impervious to frontline antibiotics, like ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, but it is also &lt;a href="https://www.coalitionagainsttyphoid.org/the-issues/drug-resistant-typhoid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;growing resistant&lt;/a&gt; to newer antibiotics, like fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even worse, these strains are spreading globally at a rapid rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most XDR Typhi cases stem from south Asia, researchers have identified nearly 200 instances of international spread since 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most strains have been exported to Southeast Asia, as well as East and Southern Africa, but typhoid superbugs have also been found in the UK, the US, and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The speed at which highly resistant strains of S Typhi have emerged and spread in recent years is a real cause for concern, and highlights the need to urgently expand prevention measures, particularly in countries at greatest risk," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/the-bacteria-that-cause-typhoid-fever-are-getting-better-at-evading-antibiotics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Stanford University infectious disease researcher Jason Andrews when the results were published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have been warning about drug-resistant typhoid for years now. In 2016, the first XDR typhoid strain was &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/27-december-2018-typhoid-pakistan-en"&gt;identified in Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. By 2019, it had become the dominant genotype in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, most XDR typhoid strains have been fought with third-generation antimicrobials, like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone_antibiotic"&gt;quinolones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalosporin"&gt;cephalosporins&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrolide"&gt;macrolides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by the early 2000s, mutations that confer resistance to quinolones accounted for more than 85 percent of all cases in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Singapore. At the same time, cephalosporin resistance was also taking over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href="https://www.coalitionagainsttyphoid.org/the-issues/drug-resistant-typhoid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;only one oral antibiotic is left&lt;/a&gt;: the macrolide, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azithromycin"&gt;azithromycin&lt;/a&gt;. And this medicine might not work for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2022 study &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(22)00093-3/fulltext#seccestitle10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; mutations that confer resistance to azithromycin are now also spreading, "threatening the efficacy of all oral antimicrobials for typhoid treatment". While these mutations have not yet been adopted by XDR S Typhi, if they are, we are in serious trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If untreated, up to 20 percent of typhoid cases can be fatal, and &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/typhoid-reported-cases-and-incidence?CODE=Global&amp;amp;YEAR="&gt;in 2024, there were over 13 million cases of typhoid reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future outbreaks can be prevented to some extent &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(24)00055-X/fulltext"&gt;with typhoid conjugate vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, but if access to these shots is not expanded globally, the world could soon have another &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/worlds-top-infectious-killer-claimed-1-23-million-lives-last-year-who-says"&gt;health crisis&lt;/a&gt; on its hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182576" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182576" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/map_4.20.1-642x361.jpg" alt="A world map highlighting regions where the typhoid vaccine is recommended.

Adults in their 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s show up in emergency rooms every day with sudden weakness, trouble speaking, or vision loss. In many stroke cases, a blood clot blocks an artery that feeds the brain. Without fresh, oxygen‑rich blood, brain cells die fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors call these events early‑onset ischemic strokes when they happen between ages 18 and 59. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re less common than strokes in older adults, but they hit people who may be in school, working, or raising families. Many want to know why it happened and whether genes play a part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of scientists led by University of Maryland School of Medicine (&lt;a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UMSOM&lt;/a&gt;) did a meta-analysis, searching the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-human-genome-map-could-transform-medicine/"&gt;human genome&lt;/a&gt; for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The number of people with early strokes is rising,” said study co-principal investigator Steven J. Kittner, MD, MPH, Professor of Neurology at UMSOM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These people are more likely to die from the life-threatening event, and survivors potentially face decades with disability. Despite this, there is little research on the causes of early strokes,” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kittner and his team combined 48 studies and compared about 16,730 adults who had an early‑onset &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/work-stress-linked-to-higher-stroke-risk-in-young-women/"&gt;ischemic stroke&lt;/a&gt; with nearly 600,000 adults who had not had a stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They used a genome‑wide association study (&lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Genome-Wide-Association-Studies-GWAS"&gt;GWAS&lt;/a&gt;), which scans millions of common DNA differences and asks whether any show up more often in people with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each small DNA change offers a tiny clue. Most of these common variants don’t act alone. Many nudge risk up or down by a little bit. Add those nudges across very large groups, and patterns start to stand out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-genome-scan-found"&gt;What the genome scan found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One region stood out: the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABO_(gene)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ABO gene&lt;/a&gt;, which helps determine blood type A, B, AB, or O. The strongest signals in the scan clustered in this region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two specific genetic markers there pushed risk in opposite directions, a pattern that fits known biology of clot formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That opposite push matters. It signals that some versions of the ABO region raise the chance a clot will form and travel toward the brain, while others lower it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-type-and-stroke"&gt;Blood type and stroke&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ABO gene does more than set letters on red blood cells. It also helps set levels of clotting‑related proteins, especially &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Willebrand_factor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;von Willebrand factor&lt;/a&gt; and factor VIII. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with non‑O blood types tend to have higher levels of these proteins, and the A1 subgroup usually sits near the high end of that range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher levels of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII can make clots more likely. That connection explains why ABO biology shows up in a study of early stroke, which often begins with a clot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shared-genetic-signals"&gt;Shared genetic signals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tested whether the same DNA signals in ABO influence several traits at once. They compared the markers tied to early‑onset stroke with markers tied to von Willebrand factor, factor VIII, and venous thromboembolism (&lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/venous-thromboembolism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;VTE&lt;/a&gt;), a condition where clots form in veins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found strong evidence that the same underlying genetic signals in the ABO region affect all these traits, and statistical tests supported shared causes rather than random overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VTE often appears as a deep‑vein clot in a leg or as a clot that breaks off and travels to the lungs. Doctors already link higher von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels to a greater chance of venous clots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic overlap connects these clinical observations to specific differences in ABO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our meta-analysis looked at people’s genetic profiles and found associations between blood type and risk of early-onset stroke,” explained study co-principal investigator Braxton D. Mitchell, PhD, MPH, Professor of Medicine at UMSOM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The association of blood type with later-onset stroke was much weaker than what we found with early stroke.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-real-world-blood-type-and-stroke"&gt;Real-world blood type and stroke&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic markers tell one part of the story; actual blood types tell another. People with early‑onset ischemic stroke were more likely to have &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/people-with-this-blood-group-age-more-slowly-according-to-new-research/"&gt;blood group&lt;/a&gt; A and less likely to have blood group O than comparison groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The B subgroup did not show a strong association with early stroke in this study, unlike patterns sometimes seen with venous clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These real‑world blood group patterns line up with the DNA signals near ABO. They point to blood‑type biology as a key piece of early stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We still don’t know why blood type A would confer a higher risk, but it likely has something to do with blood-clotting factors like platelets and cells that line the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tiny-blood-vessels-may-fuel-the-spread-of-cancer-cells/"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; as well as other circulating proteins, all of which play a role in the development of blood clots,” said Dr. Kittner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fine-grained-clues-inside-abo"&gt;Fine‑grained clues inside ABO&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One genetic marker tagged the O1 blood subgroup and was linked to about a 12 percent reduction in the odds of early stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another marker tagged the A1 subgroup and was tied to about a 16 percent increase. The story is not as simple as “any non‑O type is bad.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These opposite directions help explain why some people with certain ABO subgroups face higher risk while others see some protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limits-and-what-comes-next"&gt;Limits and what comes next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with its large numbers, the project has limits. It is one of the biggest genetic studies of early‑onset ischemic stroke so far, but it was still smaller than some studies in other diseases, so very small genetic effects may have gone undetected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most participants had European ancestry, even though the study included people from other backgrounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because genetic variants can differ in frequency and effect across populations, larger and more diverse studies will sharpen the picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-type-stroke-and-future-health"&gt;Blood type, stroke, and future health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stroke risk does not arise from DNA alone. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/trying-to-lower-your-blood-pressure-this-common-nutrient-can-help/"&gt;Blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, smoking, diabetes, unhealthy cholesterol levels, infections, hormones such as those in some oral contraceptives, and everyday habits involving sleep, diet, and exercise all play roles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings point toward clotting‑related genetics having a stronger influence on strokes that happen earlier in adult life than on strokes that occur at older ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work can test prevention strategies that mix lifestyle information, medical history, and genetics for people who might benefit most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This important and surprising research finding adds to our current knowledge about non-modifiable risk factors for stroke – including a person’s blood type,” said Mark T. Gladwin, MD, Vice President for Medical Affairs at &lt;a href="https://www.umaryland.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, Baltimore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study also highlights the need for future research to sort out the connection of blood group with clotting risk in more diverse populations. This will help us to better understand the strength of this association across different races and ethnicities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000201006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neurology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 11:56:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxOZDFEV2FRNjhuSUtzUGN4dG85dFljdC1iTVQzOHNONHZocTlESWFnclF0MklEOXVKZnd4UmJXdjlMYl9yMm4xZXN2LUZTOGRKc2czaElIcjlHamwweURWWWdPcVRTUTRlMUNrbWRyTXJycTNHVDVFYzR1eVhaM3R6RHY0UFZtd08tcmtSb0JIWHZzeVpUdWpYR1ZYb05QRjcxcmc</guid></item><item><title>新药在临床试验中将“坏”胆固醇降低58% - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/new-drug-lowers-bad-cholesterol-by-58-in-clinical-trial</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A powerful new treatment has emerged in efforts to reduce &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/high-cholesterol-diets-speed-up-cancer-tumour-growth-100-times"&gt;high cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; and the associated risk of heart health problems. In a new trial, the drug &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlicitide_decanoate"&gt;enlicitide decanoate&lt;/a&gt; was found to lower 'bad' cholesterol by almost 60 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international research team tested the drug in a randomized  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="182560" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; involving people with an inherited condition that causes dangerously high blood levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) – the 'bad' type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Heterozygous &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22067-familial-hypercholesterolemia"&gt;familial hypercholesterolemia&lt;/a&gt; (HeFH) is a common genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in 250 individuals and is characterized by elevated levels of LDL-C from birth," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.20620"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drugs-that-lower-cholesterol-may-also-reduce-dementia-risk-says-huge-new-study"&gt;Drugs That Lower Cholesterol May Also Reduce Dementia Risk, Says Huge New Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They recruited 293 participants with HeFH, who were already taking cholesterol-lowering &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"&gt;statins&lt;/a&gt; that weren't having the desired effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A once-daily enlicitide decanoate pill was shown to reduce LDL-C by an average of 58.2 percent after 24 weeks. Those &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo"&gt;given a placebo&lt;/a&gt; instead actually saw a slight rise in the levels of LDL-C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In adults with HeFH, enlicitide is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for lowering the level of LDL-C," the study authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.20620"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More positive results: side effects were limited and similar between the treatment and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="182560" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; groups, and the benefits of the experimental drug remained consistent over the 52-week trial. Key cholesterol biomarkers associated with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-factor-in-walking-improves-your-heart-health-more-than-your-step-count"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt; were reduced in the treatment group too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182563" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182563" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CholesterolChart.jpg" alt="Cholesterol chart" class="wp-image-182563 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CholesterolChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CholesterolChart-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182563" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;LDL cholesterol was significantly reduced in those who took the treatment.

The treatment is basically making sure the liver can do its &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-eggs-can-actually-lower-bad-cholesterol-new-study-says"&gt;cholesterol-clearing job&lt;/a&gt; properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are already PCSK9 inhibitors available, but they're administered via injection. Patients are more likely to stick to courses of drugs given in pill form, and here, 98 percent of the trial participants did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adherence with both the once-daily oral intervention and fasting instructions for dosing was notably high in both treatment groups," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.20620"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High LDL-C is a problem for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.891929"&gt;tens of millions of people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide, not just those with HeFH. The main negative consequence is the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries, restricting blood flow and limiting how much blood reaches the heart and brain. Heart attacks and strokes become &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-links-99-of-heart-attacks-and-strokes-with-four-risk-factors"&gt;more likely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, next the researchers want to see if this reduction in LDL-C has any meaningful impact on the risk of strokes and heart attacks, and test the drug more broadly. However, at least for this subgroup of people, we may now have a way of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drugs-that-lower-cholesterol-may-also-reduce-dementia-risk-says-huge-new-study"&gt;lowering LDL-C&lt;/a&gt; back to regular levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-eggs-can-actually-lower-bad-cholesterol-new-study-says"&gt;Eating Eggs Can Actually Lower Bad Cholesterol, New Study Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug still needs to get regulatory approval before it can be prescribed, but a phase 3 trial like this one is a key step – and the results are very encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Without timely intervention to reduce plasma LDL-C levels," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.20620"&gt;warn&lt;/a&gt;, "individuals with HeFH face an increased risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease due to cumulative lifetime exposure to elevated LDL-C levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.20620"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Next-generation vaccines could make the flu season less of a snot-filled nightmare—if they ever reach the public, that is. Trial data out this week shows that Pfizer’s mRNA-based flu vaccine performed markedly better than a traditional shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, researchers &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2416779"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; the results of a Phase III trial on the vaccine, funded by Pfizer, in the New England Journal of Medicine. The experimental vaccine was significantly more effective at preventing flu than a standard vaccine, the researchers found. The vaccine appears to cause slightly more side effects than others, but there’s a bigger concern: It’s uncertain whether it will be approved in the U.S., given the government’s current skepticism and fearmongering around mRNA vaccine technology.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Better but with a catch&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trial involved more than 18,000 healthy adult volunteers in the U.S., South Africa, and the Philippines. It took place over the course of the 2022 to 2023 flu season. People were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the experimental vaccine, dubbed modRNA, or Fluzone, a widely used inactivated flu vaccine made by Sanofi Pasteur. Both vaccines covered the four most common types of flu predicted to be circulating that season: two influenza A viruses and two influenza B viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There were noticeably fewer confirmed cases of influenza in the modRNA group compared to the control vaccine group (57 vs 87), the study showed. Overall, the modRNA vaccine was 34.5% more effective at preventing flu-like illness. The experimental vaccine also appeared to generate a higher antibody response to the influenza A strains and a similar response to the influenza B strains (nearly every confirmed flu case in the study was caused by influenza A).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This randomized trial showed that the modRNA vaccine provided both similar and improved prevention of a first episode of laboratory-confirmed influenza in adults between the ages of 18 and 64 years,” the study researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That added protection may come with some tradeoffs, however. People given modRNA reported more local reactions (70.1% vs. 43.1%) after their shot, such as injection site pain. They were also more likely to report systematic adverse events in general, such as fever (5.6% vs 1.7%).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This finding makes sense, since a vaccine’s adverse events are often linked to the immune response it generates. So a stronger immune response tends to cause more side effects. But while adverse events were more common in those who took modRNA, these events were still usually mild or moderate in severity. In the end, the study researchers concluded that the adverse event profiles of the two vaccines were similar.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The RFK Jr. wrinkle&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;All that said, the most serious hurdle to modRNA’s approval isn’t its potential side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the current U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, and his allies have systemically &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-buddies-are-back-to-undermine-vaccines-2000687069"&gt;undermined&lt;/a&gt; vaccines during the second Trump administration. Just this week, for instance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/cdc-website-now-boosts-debunked-link-between-vaccines-and-autism-2000688898"&gt;changed &lt;/a&gt;its website to boost the debunked myth that they cause autism. But as much as Kennedy and his buddies may mistrust vaccines in general, they have an especially strong hatred for mRNA vaccines, the newest type of vaccine that first saw wide use during the covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. has &lt;a href="https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2021/robert-f-kennedy-jr-said-the-covid-19-vaccine-is-the-deadliest-vaccine-ever-made-thats-not-true/"&gt;(wrongly) stated&lt;/a&gt; that the mRNA covid-19 shots developed by Pfizer and Moderna were the “deadliest” vaccines ever created, for instance. Anti-vaccination advocates have also falsely claimed that mRNA vaccines are &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/parents-pack/parents-pack-newsletter/feature-article-are-mrna-vaccines-type-gene-therapy"&gt;gene therapies&lt;/a&gt;, that they &lt;a href="https://www.sierracounty.ca.gov/FAQ.aspx?QID=95"&gt;make people magnetic&lt;/a&gt;, and that they’re causing an explosion in cases of &lt;a href="https://globalvaccinedatanetwork.org/news/turbo_cancer_and_mrna_myth_that_defies_biology_and_physics"&gt;“turbo cancer.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These unsupported fears of mRNA vaccines have had real-world consequences. In May, Moderna &lt;a href="https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/moderna-flu-covid-vaccine-fda-delay/746857/"&gt;delayed&lt;/a&gt; the approval application for its combination flu/covid-19 vaccine (which also seemed to show &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/modernas-super-vaccine-for-flu-and-covid-works-now-politics-could-sink-it-2000599293"&gt;greater protection against flu&lt;/a&gt;) after the FDA asked for more data. In August, RFK Jr. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-yanks-500-million-from-critical-mrna-vaccine-research-2000639478"&gt;also pulled&lt;/a&gt; $500 million in federal funding for mRNA vaccine research and development.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Contrary to claims from the anti-vaccination movement that mRNA vaccines are worse or more dangerous than other vaccines, this technology could actually strengthen our defenses against seasonal flu, and not just in terms of improved effectiveness. Since these vaccines typically take less time to tweak and produce than older types of vaccines, countries could wait longer to select the strains predicted to circulate during the season. That shortened lag could then prevent unexpected strains from causing a mismatch with the vaccine (a disastrous situation that’s &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-surprise-flu-variant-threw-off-the-vaccine-get-ready-for-a-brutal-winter-2000686095"&gt;now happening&lt;/a&gt; this winter).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moderna has said that it will seek approval for its stand-alone flu shot next year. And given these latest results, Pfizer will undoubtedly apply for approval of its modRNA vaccine, too. Typically, both vaccines would seem to have an excellent chance of approval. But nothing is typical these days.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Millions of Americans have shed pounds with help from drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But people who take these drugs often experience unpleasant side effects.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"They lose weight, which is a positive thing," says &lt;a href="https://medschool.umich.edu/profile/warren-yacawych" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Warren Yacawych&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Michigan, "but they experience such severe nausea and vomiting that patients stop treatment."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So at this year's Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego, Yacawych and other researchers held a session to describe their efforts to understand and solve the side-effect problem.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The weight-loss products are called &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/28/nx-s1-5587805/glp-1-ozempic-zepbound-gallup-obesity-rate" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GLP-1 agonists&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They work by mimicking a hormone that reduces appetite and slows digestion.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yacawych and his colleagues wanted to know if they could tweak these drugs to suppress appetite without making people queasy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The team focused on two areas in the brain stem where GLP-1 drugs have a big effect.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The first is affectionately known as the brain stem's vomit center," Yacawych says. "It's naturally designed to detect any accidentally ingested toxin and coordinate the feeling of nausea and the vomit response."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The second area monitors food intake and tells people when they're full.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team found a way to direct GLP-1 to the area involved in feeling full, while keeping the drug out of the vomit center.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the researchers did this, the mice no longer felt sick. But they also didn't get thin — probably because there are specific cells in the vomit center that do not induce vomiting but are critical to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So it's very challenging," Yacawych says, "to be able to separate these side effects, like nausea, from GLP-1's intended effects, like weight loss."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A possible workaround came from a team led by &lt;a href="https://endocrinology.uw.edu/people/faculty/blevins-j" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ernie Blevins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Washington. They gave obese rats a low dose of a GLP-1 drug along with the hormone &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/28/1152313319/a-new-study-casts-doubt-on-oxytocins-role-as-a-love-hormone" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;oxytocin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is itself an appetite suppressant. That allowed the rats to lose weight without feeling sick.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Not just nausea&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another side effect of GLP-1 drugs is a decrease in thirst, which could be dangerous for people who are already losing lots of fluids from side effects like vomiting and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"If you're in that state of dehydration and you're not feeling thirsty to replace those fluids, that would be a problem," says &lt;a href="https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/biological-sciences/faculty/faculty-directory/DerekDaniels.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Derek Daniels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University at Buffalo.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To understand how GLP-1 drugs reduce thirst, Daniels and a team began studying the brains of rats. And they got lucky.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"We had a happy accident in the lab," Daniels says. "And the happy accident involved a rat called the &lt;a href="https://www.eneuro.org/content/3/2/ENEURO.0150-15.2016" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brattleboro rat&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Brattleboro rats are laboratory rodents with a genetic mutation that makes them thirsty nearly all the time. But the scientists discovered that these rats are also very sensitive to GLP-1 drugs, which drastically reduced their water consumption.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team studied the rats' brains to see where GLP-1 was influencing thirst. That led them to several areas of the brain that appear to affect thirst but not appetite.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The discovery could help scientists preserve thirst by designing drugs that "target good places but not bad places," Daniels says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Appetite and addiction&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A team from the University of Virginia found that GLP-1 drugs are already targeting a brain area that plays a role in addiction as well as eating. It's a region involved in emotion and the reward system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the researchers delivered GLP-1 to this brain area in mice, it reduced their desire for "rewarding food, like a burger," says &lt;a href="https://bio.as.virginia.edu/people/ali-d-guler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ali D. Güler&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the animals continued to eat healthy, nonrewarding foods, he says — a bit like people choosing a salad bar over dessert.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Identifying this brain area should help scientists find GLP-1 drugs that target the reward system while avoiding areas involved in appetite, Güler says. And that could lead to new treatments for alcoholism and other substance use disorders.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The finding also could explain the observation that people who take GLP-1 agonists tend to reduce their consumption of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A year ago, the federal Indian Health Service posted dozens of flyers on Facebook promoting flu and COVID-19 vaccine clinics across the Navajo Nation, where the pandemic had inflicted a staggering toll just a few years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The notices, featuring photos of smiling families and elders in traditional clothing, tied immunization to tribal values like community responsibility and made a clear case for getting the shots. “Vaccines are effective at preventing serious illness or hospitalization,” one of them said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But this year, as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine critic, has put his stamp on federal immunization policy, IHS’ public messaging on vaccines has taken a stark turn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In internal emails obtained by ProPublica, IHS officials have flagged terms such as “immunizations” and “vaccines” for additional scrutiny, deeming them risky “buzzwords” that require approval from agency public information officers to be used in social media posts, pamphlets and presentations for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Through mid-October, IHS had published far fewer posts on Facebook promoting vaccine clinics this year than last, ProPublica found. And in those posts as well as other notices, it replaced language touting immunization’s benefits with wording that frames both routine childhood vaccinations and annual flu and COVID-19 shots as a personal choice, advising patients to consult health care providers about their “options regarding vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current and former IHS clinicians told ProPublica the changes threaten vaccine uptake in Navajo communities and have left medical practitioners who serve this population feeling censored.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“It seems to me that they’re trying to put up barriers,” said Harry Brown, a physician and epidemiologist who left IHS in 2016 and now works for a tribally operated health facility in North Carolina. In a 26-year career with IHS, he said, he had never encountered an effort to stifle public health campaigns or restrict what medical providers said publicly about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aside from Brown, the health care providers who spoke with ProPublica didn’t want their names used, concerned it could endanger their jobs. One physician said the new IHS restrictions on vaccine-related speech factored into her decision to leave the agency this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I can’t keep people safe,” she said in an interview just before she quit. “I don’t have any of the words anymore to say anything I need to say.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IHS’ shift in vaccine messaging has not been previously reported but aligns with widely publicized changes within the Department of Health and Human Services under Kennedy’s leadership. In the past 10 months, as measles cases have hit their highest levels in decades, Kennedy has been tepid in endorsing the vaccine to prevent the disease while taking several steps critics predict will undermine public confidence in immunization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He’s launched a federal probe into scientifically debunked links between immunizations and autism and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/05/health/rfk-jr-vaccine-funding.html"&gt;canceled nearly $500 million&lt;/a&gt; in contracts and research grants for mRNA vaccines. This technology was central to the speedy development of the COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In June, he removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine policy, replacing them with his own appointments, including several vaccine skeptics. Kennedy has also endorsed &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/idaho-vaccine-bill-medical-freedom-act-maha"&gt;the founders of Idaho’s medical freedom movement&lt;/a&gt;, who helped persuade the state to ban vaccine mandates this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At IHS, the only branch of HHS that operates its own network of hospitals and clinics, the altered federal landscape on vaccine policy has had a more direct effect on patient care, clinicians said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a statement, an HHS spokesperson said the redrafting of IHS’ public messaging materials was designed to encourage “shared decision-making” between patients and their health care providers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Indian Health Service continues to provide accurate, evidence-based information on vaccines and infectious-disease prevention,” the statement said. “Our focus remains ensuring Tribal communities have clear, trusted guidance and access to the care they choose.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The statement didn’t address questions about what prompted the revamped messaging or concerns raised by doctors about its potential effect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a separate statement, Matthew Clark, the IHS’ deputy chief medical officer, insisted the agency’s approach to immunizations has remained consistent, even if its messaging about them has changed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We continue to advocate that every patient at every encounter be offered every FDA-approved and ACIP-recommended vaccine, when appropriate,” Clark’s statement said.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear yet what effect the changes are having. Data hasn’t been released showing this season’s flu and COVID-19 vaccination rates for the Navajo Nation. Through September, the uptake rate for the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, known as MMR, for 2-year-olds has held steady at around 95%, the level of herd immunity needed to prevent outbreaks, IHS data shows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, IHS clinicians said, the agency’s lack of public messaging about vaccines was especially notable during the winter and spring, when a measles outbreak emerged in Texas and then neared the reservation’s borders in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outbreak had spurred alarm. Tribal health facilities, which operate independently from IHS, flooded Facebook with information about MMR shots at the end of February and urged residents to get themselves and their children vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet two IHS doctors said that at about the same time, the agency installed its new restrictions on vaccine-related speech.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a March 13 email that Ryan Goldtooth, a public information officer at one Navajo Nation hospital, sent to colleagues, members of the group had been instructed to take down social media posts or flyers that contained the terms “vaccines (namely Measles)” and “immunizations” from the agency’s Facebook pages. “We cannot forward or post to the public,” the email said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The email also said that the terms “immunizations” and “vaccines” had been reclassified “from low to medium-risk.” As a result, if clinicians used these words in public presentations and printed materials, they needed to be cleared by a public information officer first, Goldtooth wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The email listed several other topics or types of information that could no longer be freely shared or talked about publicly. Starting from the date President Donald Trump returned to office, any information shared from a state health department, for instance, had to be removed from Facebook, the email said, without providing a reason. Any posts about executive orders also had to come down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Goldtooth, who still works for IHS, did not respond to requests for comment about the email.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laura Hammitt, the director of infectious disease programs for the Center for Indigenous Health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, has worked closely with IHS staffers on vaccination efforts. Limiting what they can say about vaccines could harm their ability to respond to future outbreaks, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People are really trying to be compliant with changes required by the administration but also have a responsibility to care for their patients,” Hammitt said. “Those two things can seem to be at odds.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Navajo Nation, the country’s largest tribal jurisdiction with around 170,000 residents, has long been a focal point and challenge for IHS. The reservation is served by four of the agency’s 22 hospitals, but pockets within its 27,000 square miles of mountains and high desert have no cellphone service, internet access or electricity, creating hurdles for clinicians when it comes to communicating information and delivering care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These structural issues had a devastating effect at the start of the pandemic, when the reservation’s rates of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths were among the highest in the country. The virus claimed the lives of at least &lt;a href="https://nec.navajo-nsn.gov/Data-Dashboard/COVID-19"&gt;2,300 Navajo citizens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In the previous decade, vaccination rates among Navajos, especially for MMR and the flu, had regularly exceeded figures for the nation overall. They also exceeded rates for tribal communities in other regions served by IHS, which typically lagged behind the national average, according to the agency’s data. When the COVID-19 vaccine arrived in 2021, Native Americans’ uptake exceeded 60%, an effort bolstered by IHS public service messages and outreach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the Navajo Nation, IHS hospitals posted messages on their Facebook pages and circulated flyers that pushed community members to get the shots. “Protect yourself, protect your family, protect your elders,” the flyers said. Tribal members responded, arriving at clinics in droves, lining up in their vehicles to get vaccinated at hospitals and clinics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those who couldn’t travel to larger towns on the reservation that had health care facilities, teams working for IHS, the tribe and Johns Hopkins set up mobile clinics and made home visits to especially remote communities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the pandemic, IHS and tribal teams on the Navajo Nation sought to extend the COVID-19 shot success to routine vaccines. MMR immunization rates among 2-year-olds had dropped to 85%, but another coordinated effort restored communities on the reservation to prepandemic levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IHS was the engine driving the campaign, said Hammitt, the Johns Hopkins doctor. Agency flyers and Facebook posts retooled appeals used to promote COVID-19 shots to endorse the MMR vaccine, adding a call to protect “future generations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first few months of this year, however, the messaging began to morph again, with mentions of “measles” and “COVID” disappearing from IHS social media pages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The weeks leading up to flu season and the new school year typically usher in a robust vaccine campaign in IHS hospitals. But this year, doctors took note of how few notices went out, they said, as New Mexico continued to contend with the measles outbreak that began in Texas and the Navajo Nation encountered a late-summer surge in COVID-19 cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One exception came in May, when IHS officials shared a New Mexico Department of Health alert on Facebook saying measles had reached Sandoval County, which overlaps with the eastern flank of the Navajo reservation. Another came that same month, when the IHS hospital in the town of Gallup, New Mexico, announced a clinic for people who wanted to get vaccinated for measles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The IHS hospital in Shiprock, New Mexico, was the only facility to post a public service announcement about a back-to-school vaccine clinic for children. It included language telling patients to talk to doctors about their options and didn’t specifically mention measles, COVID-19 or any other infectious disease as such announcements had in the past.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another measles outbreak surfaced in the Southwest in mid-August, this time just to the west of the Navajo Nation along the Arizona-Utah border. In early November, it had grown to at least 200 confirmed cases, according to Arizona and Utah health officials. IHS didn’t issue any advisories or notices on Facebook about this outbreak. The new approval processes for greenlighting public health alerts slowed down local administrators’ and hospitals’ response, the clinicians who spoke to ProPublica noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several clinicians said the restrictions on vaccine-related speech alter the relationship between IHS doctors and patients, even if they apply only to public communications and not to one-on-one consultations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is what we do for a living, and the most important thing we do is explain what’s going on to patients,” one of the doctors said. “If there is an external body interfering with that, as there is now, then that is shaping the fundamental trust between patients and the people trying to provide their care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;Your morning routine probably feels harmless enough. Splash some water, apply your products, get on with your day. But what if I told you that some of your most automatic daily habits are actually working against you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent years not really thinking about how I treated my face. I was too busy, too focused on other things, and honestly, I figured aging was just inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I started noticing changes that seemed to happen faster than they should. Fine lines that appeared overnight. Skin that looked tired even when I wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's when I started digging into the research. Turns out, science has quite a bit to say about the everyday things we do that speed up aging. And most of them are so ingrained in our routines that we don't even register them as choices anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) Touching your face constantly throughout the day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times have you rested your chin in your hand today? Rubbed your eyes? Absentmindedly touched your cheek while thinking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became aware of this habit during a particularly stressful period when I was working long hours. I'd catch myself in video calls with my hand on my face, over and over. Didn't think much of it until I read the &lt;a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/news/a13196/why-you-shouldnt-touch-your-face/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on how our hands transfer bacteria, oils, and environmental pollutants directly onto our skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time you touch your face, you're potentially introducing irritants that trigger inflammation. And inflammation is one of the primary drivers of premature aging. Your hands have been everywhere: keyboards, door handles, your phone. All that gets transferred straight to your pores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking this habit takes serious awareness because it's so automatic. I started by simply noticing when I did it, without judgment. That awareness alone cut down my face-touching by half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) Skipping sunscreen on cloudy days or when you're indoors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a question: when was the last time you wore sunscreen on a rainy day? Or while working from home?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think sunscreen was only necessary for beach days or summer. The research tells a completely different story. UV rays penetrate clouds and windows. They're hitting your skin right now, even if you're inside reading this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.aad.org/news/survey-shows-sun-protection-lacking-in-winter"&gt;American Academy of Dermatology&lt;/a&gt; reports that up to 80% of UV rays can penetrate clouds. And UVA rays, the ones responsible for aging, pass right through glass. So that sunny spot by your window where you like to sit? Your skin is getting exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really got my attention was learning about cumulative UV damage. It's not the occasional sunburn that ages you fastest. It's the daily, unremarkable exposure that adds up over decades. Those few minutes walking to your car. The light coming through your windshield during your commute. It all counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started treating sunscreen like brushing my teeth. Non-negotiable, every single day, regardless of weather or plans. The difference in my skin over just a few months was noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) Using hot water to wash your face&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something satisfying about washing your face with hot water, especially after a long day. It feels cleansing, almost therapeutic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's what that hot water is actually doing: stripping away your skin's natural protective oils. Your skin has a barrier function that keeps moisture in and irritants out. Hot water damages that barrier, leaving your skin vulnerable to dehydration and environmental stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8778033/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that hot water increases transepidermal water loss. Essentially, your skin can't hold onto moisture as effectively. And dehydrated skin shows every line, every wrinkle, every sign of aging more prominently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed this shift when I started paying attention to how my skin felt after washing. Hot water left it tight and uncomfortable. Once I switched to lukewarm water, that tight feeling disappeared. My skin looked plumper and more hydrated within weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideal temperature is tepid, barely warm to the touch. It might not feel as satisfying initially, but your skin will thank you for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) Sleeping on your side or stomach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one surprised me because I'd been a side sleeper my entire adult life. Turns out, the way you sleep matters more than you'd think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you press your face into a pillow night after night, you're creating creases and folds in your skin. These "sleep wrinkles" are temporary, but as we get older and our skin becomes less elastic, they &lt;a href="https://medicine.uq.edu.au/article/2024/05/sleep-wrinkles-are-real-here%E2%80%99s-how-they-leave-their%C2%A0mark"&gt;become permanent lines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started noticing a deeper line on the left side of my face, exactly where my face met the pillow each night. That was my wake-up call. I've been slowly training myself to sleep on my back, which is harder than it sounds after decades of habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even switching to a silk or satin pillowcase can help. These materials create less friction against your skin compared to cotton. It's a small change that adds up over thousands of nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) Applying products by rubbing and tugging at your skin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you apply your moisturizer? If you're rubbing it in vigorously or pulling at your skin, you might want to reconsider your technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think I needed to really work products into my skin for them to be effective. Rubbing in circles, pulling upward, putting in effort. The reality is that your facial skin is delicate, and all that tugging stretches it out over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it this way: your skin has elasticity, but it's not infinite. Every time you pull and stretch, you're challenging that elasticity. Do it multiple times a day for years, and you're essentially training your skin to stay stretched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-apply-moisturizer-6824874#:~:text=Aim%20for%20about%20a%20quarter,to%20do%20this%20at%20night."&gt;Dermatologists&lt;/a&gt; recommend gentle patting or pressing motions instead. Let your products sink in through light pressure rather than friction. This approach is particularly important for the delicate skin around your eyes, which shows damage more quickly than anywhere else on your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I changed my entire skincare application routine to gentle pressing motions. It felt weird at first because I wasn't "doing" as much. But my skin responded well to the gentler treatment almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) Skimping on sleep regularly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're busy, sleep is often the first thing to go. I went through years of functioning on five or six hours a night, thinking I could make it up later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But your skin repairs itself during sleep. That's not metaphorical, it's biological fact. During deep sleep, your body increases blood flow to your skin and rebuilds collagen. Miss out on sleep, and you miss out on this crucial repair time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25266053/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; found that poor sleepers showed increased signs of skin aging, including fine lines, uneven pigmentation, and reduced skin elasticity. They also recovered more slowly from environmental stressors like sun exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really struck me was learning that even one night of poor sleep affects your skin's barrier function. But chronic sleep deprivation? That creates a cascade of aging effects that compound over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that on weeks when I prioritized seven to eight hours of sleep, my skin looked visibly different. Brighter, more even, less puffy. It was like getting a spa treatment just from sleeping properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) Eating sugar and refined carbs throughout the day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This connection between diet and skin aging wasn't obvious to me until I started looking into the research on glycation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what happens: when you eat sugar and refined carbohydrates, they break down into glucose in your bloodstream. Excess glucose molecules attach to proteins in your body, including collagen and elastin, through a process called glycation. This creates harmful molecules called advanced glycation end products, or AGEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AGEs literally make your skin less elastic and more prone to wrinkles and sagging. &lt;a href="https://www.unitypoint.org/news-and-articles/the-link-between-sugar-and-aging"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that glycation contributes significantly to skin aging and that dietary choices directly impact this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to snack on sugary foods throughout the day without thinking about it. A cookie here, some candy there, refined carbs at every meal. When I became vegan and started paying more attention to what I ate, I naturally cut back on processed sugars. The change in my skin was one of the first things I noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean you can never have sugar. Just be aware that regular consumption of high-sugar foods is doing more than affecting your energy levels. It's affecting how your skin ages at a cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, aging is natural and inevitable. There's no magic routine that stops time completely. But understanding what accelerates the process gives you the power to make different choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What strikes me most about this list is how automatic these habits are. We're not consciously deciding to age our skin faster. We're just going through our days, doing what we've always done, not realizing the cumulative impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you know better, you can do better. You don't have to overhaul your entire life overnight. Pick one habit from this list and work on changing it. Once that feels natural, move to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've worked on all of these over the past few years, and I can honestly say my skin looks better now than it did five years ago. Not because of expensive products or treatments, but because I stopped doing the everyday things that were working against me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your face is with you for life. Treating it with a little more awareness and care isn't vanity. It's just smart maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Doctors often emphasize that prioritizing your mental health is important.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, according to doctors, there is one particular aspect of your health that is often overlooked — and that's pelvic floor health for both men and women.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials and doctors describe pelvic floor health as maintaining strong and flexible muscles that support your bladder, bowels, and uterus. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common disorders concerning your pelvic floor include leaking urine, leaking stool, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One clinic in Little Rock has been working to change that and encourages men and women in Central Arkansas to prioritize their pelvic floor health.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D. Sally Oliphant is a doctor at Arkansas Urogynecology and Women’s Health who explained that pelvic floor disorders are often overlooked and under-addressed.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think urinary issues may be something women ignore, and think is normal after childbirth or with aging,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why her clinic has been working to alleviate this burden for men and women by utilizing state-of-the-art equipment and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So we have a cystoscopy tower, and that's how we're able to look diagnostically in the bladder with a camera, and then do some of the treatments for urinary incontinence and inject the bladder with Botox, through a cystoscope. We can also inject the urethra with stress incontinence," she described.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mayo Clinic estimates nearly one in three women over the age of 20 may have a form of pelvic floor dysfunction. Though they suspect the number is much higher due to underreporting.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One habit that I think a lot of women get into is that we're always in a hurry, and you're emptying your bladder and you're pushing to get it done quickly. And that's really not a good bladder habit to try and push to get all that bladder out,” Dr. Oliphant said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, she suggests taking your time, listening to your body, and recognizing when you need to check in with doctors.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's really important not to neglect the health of the vagina, the bladder, and the pelvic floor," she added.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

Not only is the research clear about this but Dr. Roberts DC, at &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Heath Utah&lt;/a&gt;, is on the front lines helping prevent and resolve side effects. He reports seeing some of the problems patients are experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such case involved a 16-year-old girl. Roberts says, "She came into my clinic with excruciating pain. She couldn't even drink water without severe abdominal distress. Even though she was on Semaglutide for only a short time, the pain persisted for six months after she stopped injecting it. That's when she came to see me. Fortunately with care, her pain resolved within a few weeks. Incredibly she lost no weight throughout the whole ordeal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients aren't so lucky. Their symptoms are more severe or longer lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: N F/peopleimages.com/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Serious side effects of starting GLP-1 Agonists&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/09/health/report-ozempic-and-other-weight-loss-drugs-linked-to-162-us-deaths/#:~:text=Weight%20loss%20shots%20like%20Ozempic,over%20the%20past%20six%20months" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; in the New York Post, since 2018, a total of 10,000 serious or life-threatening reactions have been reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database (FAERS).  And sadly, medical professionals and manufacturers have reported that these shots were a factor in 162 deaths. The number of these deaths rose by an astonishing 40% over a recent six month period as more and more people started using them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts says, "The reality is that the risk of death while taking these drugs is probably no greater than many other very common drugs. This just underscores the general principle that there are inherent risks in taking any kind of medication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9192250/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;1997 study&lt;/a&gt; unfortunately found that, more often than not, doctors fail to tell their patients about the risks. So Roberts encourages patients to take on the responsibility of informing themselves, weighing the risks and considering all their options before taking a drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a618008.html#:~:text=Semaglutide%20injection%20may%20increase%20the,swallowing;%20or%20shortness%20of%20breath" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Semaglutide label&lt;/a&gt; lists the following potential side effects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pancreatitis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thyroid tumors, including cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Severe gastrointestinal disease such as stomach paralysis and intestinal blockage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bloating, severe constipation, nausea, and vomiting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acute kidney injury.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hypoglycemia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gallbladder disease including Gallstones and inflammation of the gallbladder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allergic reactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vision changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rapid or pounding heartbeat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suicidal behavior and ideation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recent studies have found other concerning side effects not listed on the label. The following represent a couple of these studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38937282/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; reported in the journal, Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, up to 60% of weight lost on Liraglutide is lean muscle mass, which can weaken physical function and slow metabolism. "That means that for every three pounds you lose, almost two of them could be from muscle," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255#google_vignette" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;2025 population study&lt;/a&gt; reported in JAMA Ophthalmology found there is approximately a threefold increased risk of a sudden vision loss called non-arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/clinical-trials-may-not-differentiate-data-show-women-more-2025a1000lb2?form=fpf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;2025 article&lt;/a&gt; in Medscape reported FAERS analysis found incidences of anosmia, (loss of smell), dysgeusia (altered taste), tinnitus (ringing in the ears), dysphonia (voice changes), hearing disabilities and gastroesophageal reflux disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Kyrylo Ryzhov/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stopping GLP-1 Agonists: Brace for weight regain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're thinking about stopping GLP-1 agonists, be prepared for what's likely to happen. Research published in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism showed that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35441470/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;327 participants in the study&lt;/a&gt; regained two thirds of their weight within a year after discontinuing the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537024000543" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;research published in Sciencedirect&lt;/a&gt; showed that the weight people regain after the shots has a higher fat-to-muscle ratio, leading to a lowered metabolic rate and increased metabolic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyone coming off these drugs must understand this near-certain outcome if they want to prevent it," Roberts says. "If people coming off the medications will treat the drugs as a jump start to optimal health and weight, rather than the means to it and then take certain steps, they can maintain the weight loss and continue to lose weight if necessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to maintain weight loss after the shots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first step is to accept the fact that there is no short cut to optimal health and weight," Roberts says. "The laws of health cannot be circumvented with any kind of medication. You may have lost some weight with the shots, but it will all come back with a vengeance unless you adhere to those laws."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second step is to identify any underlying health issues that may be causing your stubborn weight or contributing to conditions that cause it. "Depression, insomnia, hormone imbalances, bad bacteria in the gut, liver/gallbladder problems, insulin resistance, leptin resistance, toxins and deficiencies can all contribute to both weight gain and stubborn weight," Roberts says. &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;At Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;, it is the first order of business to identify these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each patient undergoes a specialized non-invasive body scan. The scan is a functional state assessment of the body which provides an immediate overview of the patient's physiology, stress, fatigue, risk factors, and potential underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to every appointment at Health Utah, patients fill out a proprietary questionnaire that also can identify these underlying problems. The questionnaire is the result of Roberts' 30 years of experience and research. There is almost always a perfect correlation between the results of the scan and the questionnaire. Roberts uses both of these to guide him through a 40-minute consultation and evaluation with each patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third step is to address all underlying health conditions through a customized protocol of care. A care plan can include therapies, supplementation, hypnotherapy, coaching and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final step is to create a customized, healthy and sustainable food plan. Roberts says, "The shots work partially because they reduce the calories you eat. But the shots ultimately fail, like almost every other diet, precisely because they reduce the calories you eat. Calorie reduction never works long term because your body's metabolism slows down when threatened by reduced calories."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Health Utah they don't cut calories, count calories, count macros or points. They don't have you cut out whole categories of food like carbs. They don't tell you to eat all meat or all fat or give you any other faddish diet. They customized your food plan according to your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Take these steps and you will likely be able to maintain the weight you lost while on the shots and get healthier at the same time, something the shots could never do," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Special offer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any health or weight loss journey, it is essential to have the help of family and friends. In a British study, researchers found that both men and women had almost twice as much success losing weight when they did it with a partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; is offering this, their most popular weight loss package, for $59 for two people. You and a friend can get tested, receive a 17-page report, take the proprietary survey and get a consultation with Dr. Roberts. The scan alone is normally $300 for one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call (801) 609-3478 or visit &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; today to schedule your appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The opinions and conclusions expressed in this article are the sponsor's own and do not reflect the views or opinions of KSL.com.

However, one woman got a taste of the latter even before the holiday began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a post on the subreddit &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jsvrx1/aita_for_canceling_thanksgiving/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Am I the [Jerk?]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, she explained that, just like each year, her sister-in-law demanded a separate meal due to her ever-changing dietary choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman tried to reason with her and searched for solutions that wouldn’t require her to put in additional effort in the kitchen (after all, she was already going to host the entire family), but it quickly blew up into what her husband called “ridiculous high school drama.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, she asked the internet to weigh in on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;This woman got a text from her sister-in-law, asking her to make a separate Thanksgiving meal to accommodate her fertility diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="sil-special-diet-canceling-thanksgiving-1"

healthy amount of physical activity in your daily life can make a difference in your probability of becoming fertile if you are experiencing problems with ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/11/changes-in-diet-and-lifestyle-may-help-prevent-infertility/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by the Harvard School of Public Health, which comprised nearly 18,000 women, discovered a higher incidence of ovulatory disorder in those who consumed more trans fats, sugar from carbohydrates, and animal proteins. On the other hand, those who consumed more iron, fiber, and protein from vegetables had a higher fertility diet score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, “studies have shown that consuming a certain quantity of monounsaturated fats during the IVF cycle increased the success rate by three and a half times, as opposed to women who don’t eat good plant-based fats during that period,” &lt;a href="https://www.parents.com/getting-pregnant/fertility/what-to-eat-to-get-pregnant/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Alisa Vitti, integrative nutritionist and author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/WomanCode-Perfect-Amplify-Fertility-Supercharge/dp/006213079X?tag=vilofjoy-20" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WomanCode: Perfect Your Cycle, Amplify Your Fertility, Supercharge Your Sex Drive, and Become a Power Source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These include avocados, nuts, and some oils (like olive oil, peanut oil, and canola oil).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_desktop_post_4" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are things people who are trying to conceive should ignore, too. For example, if you’re having continued trouble, your doctor may suggest limiting dairy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re being exposed to dairy in mass quantities that’s more hormonally-driven, meaning the production of cow dairy has become very chemically manipulated,” Vitti explains. “These excess hormones may disrupt the conversation that the brain is trying to have with the endocrine system, particularly your ovaries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it can be overwhelming for someone to devise a menu that’s suitable for everyone coming over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanksgiving, despite its &lt;a

			&lt;p&gt;A new chemical compound has shown promise for treating  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="182363" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease. Its effects in a rat model of the disease were impressive, and the biochemists who discovered it are eager to progress to in-human trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. And while it's still unclear whether these &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-may-not-actually-be-a-brain-disease-reveals-expert"&gt;plaques cause the disease's symptoms, or are merely a side-effect,&lt;/a&gt; they remain a major research focus for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that current treatment options for Alzheimer's extend only to symptom relief, the race is on to find drugs that may actually tackle the disease from its roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer-drugs-show-alzheimers-promise-in-mice"&gt;Scientists Found 2 Existing Drugs Can Reverse Alzheimer's Brain Damage in Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new compound works by stripping excess copper out of the harmful beta-amyloid plaques in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"About a decade ago, international studies began to point to the influence of copper ions as an aggregator of beta-amyloid plaques," &lt;a href="https://agencia.fapesp.br/researchers-develop-chemical-compound-with-potential-against-alzheimers-disease/56422"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; biochemist Giselle Cerchiaro from Federal University of the ABC (UFABC) in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was discovered that genetic mutations and changes in enzymes that act in the transport of copper in cells could lead to the accumulation of the element in the brain, favoring the aggregation of these plaques. Thus, the regulation of copper homeostasis [balance] has become one of the focuses for the treatment of Alzheimer's."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182456" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182456" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/56422-642x533.jpg" alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-182456" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/56422-642x533.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/56422-768x637.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/56422-600x498.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/56422.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182456" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The new compound can strip beta-amyloid clumps of excess copper. (ACS Chemical Neuroscience)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copper accumulation &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2017.00446"&gt;isn't always an issue for Alzheimer's patients&lt;/a&gt;: some actually experience a deficit of the essential metal in their brains. But for those &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-deposits-of-copper-and-magnetic-iron-in-alzheimer-s-brains"&gt;who do have an excess&lt;/a&gt;, scientists &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2362.2002.00933.x"&gt;have long suspected&lt;/a&gt; that returning the brain's copper levels to normal could help improve some symptoms, especially brain damage from oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tested which compounds in a set of nine could best pull the copper from brain plaques. These compounds – eight &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imine"&gt;imines&lt;/a&gt; (organic compounds containing a carbon-nitrogen double bond) and one &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinoline"&gt;quinoline&lt;/a&gt;-based – were first put through a virtual, 'in silico' experiment, which revealed two of the imines (which the researchers labelled as L09 and L10) and the quinoline-based compound (here dubbed L11) as suitable candidates for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The computer test suggested these three compounds should be able to pass the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/blood-brain-barrier-guardian-shows-promise-against-alzheimers"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; (an essential hurdle for any in-brain therapy) and could potentially be given to patients as pills to swallow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, mouse brain cells grown in a lab were exposed to each of the three candidate compounds for 24 hours, to test their toxicity. Compound L11 did the most damage to cells and showed signs of exacerbating oxidative stress: not a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, L09 and L10 showed relatively low toxicity, while also protecting the cells' lipids and DNA from damage usually associated with the oxidative stress that accompanies beta-amyloid buildup.&lt;br&gt;

As well as restoring normal levels of copper in the hippocampus (the brain region best known for its role in short- and long-term memory), the compound also significantly reduced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. The rats treated with this compound also performed much better in a maze activity designed to test their spatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, compounds L09 and L11 had a much weaker impact in all measures.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cerchiaro and team are keen to move forward with clinical tests, which will give a clearer idea of how viable this treatment might be for human &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-may-now-know-why-alzheimers-erases-memories-of-our-loved-ones"&gt;Alzheimer's patients&lt;/a&gt;, of whom there are an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.alzint.org/about/dementia-facts-figures/dementia-statistics/"&gt;55 million worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an extremely simple, safe, and effective molecule," Cerchiaro &lt;a href="https://agencia.fapesp.br/researchers-develop-chemical-compound-with-potential-against-alzheimers-disease/56422"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "The compound we've developed is much less expensive than available drugs. Therefore, even if it only works for part of the population, since Alzheimer's disease has multiple causes, it'd represent a huge advance &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-of-our-biggest-hopes-for-alzheimers-treatment-doesnt-seem-to-work"&gt;over current options&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acschemneuro.5c00291"&gt;ACS Chemical Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;OREM, Utah — A Utah native and her 4-year-old son are facing the unimaginable: they were both diagnosed with cancer on the same day, just one hour apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britney McRae, a mother of three, and her son Jamon learned of their diagnoses last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamon has a rare pediatric brain tumor called ependymoma, while Britney is battling gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, a cancer that developed after a molar pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My wife’s [cancer] actually has a pretty good cure rate,” husband and father Jake McRae said. “My son’s is not as good a cure rate, but we’re kind of hopeful that he falls into the good percentage range of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britney and Jake McRae both grew up and met in Orem. Jake’s job as a medical doctor moved them to Medford, Oregon, most recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family lives six hours from the nearest children’s hospital. Jake travels between Stanford, California, and Portland, Oregon, for Jamon’s care. His other two children, a seven-year-old and a one-year-old, are being cared for by his grandparents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamon, described as funny and cuddly, began suffering headaches before tests revealed the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The subtype he has is not the good one,” Jake said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said Britney experienced a molar pregnancy around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She was about eight weeks pregnant, went in to get an ultrasound, and when they did the first ultrasound, they’re like, ‘We don’t see anything that looks like a baby at all. It’s mostly like cysts,'” Jake said. “And her blood levels that check if you’re pregnant are kind of off the charts, which was concerning. And then she ended up going to get surgery to get everything out, like a D&amp;amp;C and it came back as a molar pregnancy. And then there’s a very small chance that the molar pregnancies will develop into what’s called GTN, which is like a cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two surgeries, Jamon is struggling with double vision and difficulty swallowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extended family in Utah is heartbroken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s unimaginable that both of them, within such a short period of time,” said Elaine Allred, Britney’s grandmother. “It was like I entered a world I didn’t recognize.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sister-in-law Chantal McRae said the family was all together back in September. They had no idea this was coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I feel like none of us really felt like it was real at first,” Chantal said. “We’ve all been really, really struggling with the emotions and being so far away from them and the inability to be there for them physically and support them through this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brother-in-law Kyson Clegg said the family’s faith is helping them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s been difficult to reconcile the loving God that we believe in with this suffering of Jamon, but through it all, our faith is going to get us through it,” he said. “I believe in the kid. He’s a tough little kid. He’s a fighter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britney’s sister, Amber Bateman said Britney and Jamon’s bond is special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With her treatments, it definitely pulls her away,” Bateman said. “So many times he’ll just be laying in bed and he’s like, ‘Mom, where are my cuddles? Where are my snuggles?’ And Jake will be like, ‘Can I snuggle?’ He’s like, ‘No. I need mom snuggles.'”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jake said it’s hard to be on this side of illness and hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jamon is kind of getting to the point where he’s sick of being poked and prodded and all the things that they do. And the first question he asks is, ‘Are they going to hurt me?’ As a dad, it’s so hard to see this,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allred said Britney and Jake are staying strong for their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Britney always has a smile on her face, even with the news,” Allred said. “I admire Jake for being able to hold it together. And, it’s a big responsibility. And it’s tough seeing people that you love go through such a terrible experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britney’s brother launched a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/mother-son-fighting-cancer-help-britney-jamon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;*GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; to help with travel costs and missed work. The family hopes Jamon regains enough strength to enjoy a sweet treat by Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s just the biggest lover,” Chantal said. “He’s hilarious. He’s so funny … it’s really hard to see him going through this.”&lt;/p&gt;

A &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt0180" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;2024 study published in Science&lt;/a&gt;, for example, found how a single genetic change in an H5N1 virus was enough to shift the virus’s receptor binding preference from birds to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KSTYKTV6EVEARD3EEQATPOQ6TA"&gt;The current risk to the public is low because there has been no record of the virus spreading from one human to another, according to state and federal health agencies.

							&lt;p&gt;My neighbor Margaret is 67 and has skin that honestly looks better than some people I know in their forties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, her sister visits from across the country a few times a year, and despite being three years younger, looks noticeably older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same genetics, completely different results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting curious about this, I started paying closer attention to what people with great skin actually do versus what they think they're supposed to do. Turns out, a lot of us are unknowingly aging ourselves faster by sticking with outdated habits that no longer serve us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're still doing these things, it might be time to reconsider your approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) Using harsh, stripping cleansers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when we were told to wash our faces until they felt "squeaky clean"? That tight, almost dry feeling after cleansing was supposed to mean your skin was actually clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that advice has aged about as well as some of those old skincare routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harsh cleansers strip away your skin's natural oils and damage the moisture barrier. After 60, your skin already produces less oil naturally, so stripping what little you have leaves your skin looking dull, dry, and yes, older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made this mistake for years, using foaming cleansers that left my face feeling tight. Once I switched to gentler, creamy cleansers, the difference was noticeable within weeks. My skin looked plumper and more hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your cleanser should remove makeup and dirt without leaving your skin feeling parched. If your face feels tight after washing, that's not clean. That's damaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) Skipping sunscreen on cloudy days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times have you looked outside, seen gray skies, and decided to skip the SPF?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing about UV rays. They don't take days off just because you can't see the sun. Up to 80% of UV rays can penetrate clouds, meaning you're still getting sun damage even when it's overcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women I know with the best skin in their sixties and beyond wear sunscreen every single day, regardless of the weather or whether they're planning to go outside. It's as automatic as brushing their teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sun damage is cumulative. Every unprotected day adds up over the years, showing up as age spots, wrinkles, and uneven texture. You can use the most expensive serums and creams in the world, but if you're not protecting your skin from UV damage, you're basically taking one step forward and two steps back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make SPF 30 or higher part of your morning routine, rain or shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) Over-exfoliating to chase that "glow"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exfoliation can be wonderful for your skin. The keyword here is "can be."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too many people over 60 are exfoliating daily, sometimes multiple times a day, because they've heard it gives you glowing skin. And while gentle exfoliation does help remove dead skin cells and brighten your complexion, overdoing it creates the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive exfoliation damages your skin barrier, increases sensitivity, and actually accelerates aging. Your skin becomes red, irritated, and more prone to wrinkles because you've stripped away the protective layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went through a phase in my late thirties where I was using a physical scrub in the morning and a chemical exfoliant at night. My skin looked inflamed and aged rather than glowing. When I scaled back to exfoliating just twice a week, everything calmed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we age, our skin becomes thinner and more delicate. It needs gentler treatment, not more aggressive scrubbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) Applying products to dry skin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you apply your serums and moisturizers to completely dry skin? This is one of those habits that seems logical but actually works against you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slightly damp skin absorbs products much better than dry skin. When your skin is damp, it acts like a sponge, pulling hydration and active ingredients deeper into the layers where they can actually do something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The better approach is to pat your skin mostly dry after cleansing, leaving it slightly damp, then immediately apply your serums and moisturizers. This locks in that extra moisture and helps your products work more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's such a small change but makes a real difference in how hydrated and plump your skin looks. I started doing this a few years ago after reading about it, and I honestly can't believe I spent so many years doing it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your expensive skincare works better when you apply it correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) Using the same products year-round&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your skin's needs change with the seasons, but many people use the exact same routine in humid summer and dry winter alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In winter, indoor heating and cold outdoor air create a much drier environment. Your skin needs richer, more occlusive moisturizers to prevent moisture loss. In summer, humidity is higher and your skin might need lighter formulations to avoid feeling greasy or clogged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women with great skin adjust their routines seasonally. They might use a lighter gel cream in summer and switch to a heavier balm in winter. They add hydrating essences when the air is dry and scale back when it's humid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your skin is telling you what it needs if you pay attention. Tight and flaky in winter? Add more moisture. Breaking out in summer? Lighten up your products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One routine doesn't fit all seasons, especially as your skin becomes more sensitive with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) Neglecting the neck and chest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick question: do you stop at your jawline when applying skincare?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people do, and that's exactly why their neck and chest often look older than their face. The skin on your neck is thinner and more delicate than facial skin, with fewer oil glands. It shows age quickly if you're not taking care of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see women all the time with beautifully maintained facial skin and necks that tell a completely different story. It's such a missed opportunity because treating these areas takes literally seconds more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you put on your face should go on your neck and chest too. Cleanser, serums, moisturizer, and especially sunscreen. Apply with upward strokes rather than dragging the delicate skin downward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) Sleeping on cotton pillowcases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might seem like a minor detail, but the surface you sleep on for 7-8 hours every night actually matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cotton pillowcases absorb moisture from your skin and can create friction that leads to sleep lines and wrinkles over time. After 60, when your skin is already losing elasticity and moisture, those sleep lines don't bounce back as quickly as they used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silk or satin pillowcases create less friction and don't absorb moisture from your skin and hair. They're gentler on aging skin and can help prevent those creases that eventually become permanent wrinkles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was skeptical about this until I tried it myself. The difference wasn't dramatic overnight, but after a few months, I noticed my skin looked less creased in the morning and felt more hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For something that costs less than a decent moisturizer and lasts for years, it's worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at this list, you might notice a theme. Most of these habits come from outdated advice or from doing too much rather than too little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your skin after 60 needs a gentler, more thoughtful approach than it did in your twenties or even your forties. It's not about having a ten-step routine with the most expensive products. It's about understanding what your skin actually needs and dropping the habits that work against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by picking one habit from this list to change. Maybe it's finally committing to daily sunscreen or switching to a gentler cleanser. Small, consistent changes add up to significant results over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your skin has carried you through decades of life. Treat it with the care and respect it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;

In the UK, about &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/26/young-people-england-common-mental-health-conditions-nhs-survey" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a quarter of older teenagers&lt;/a&gt; and up to a fifth of younger children have anxiety, depression or other mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the UK, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) guidance says under-18s with moderate to severe depression &lt;a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng134" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can be prescribed antidepressants alongside therapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But a new review of trial data by academics in Austria and the UK concluded that fluoxetine, sold under the brand name of Prozac among others, is clinically no better than placebo drugs in treating depression in children, and should therefore no longer be prescribed to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The authors conducted a meta analysis of 12 large trials involving Prozac, published between 1997 and 2024, and concluded that fluoxetine improved children’s depressive symptoms so little as to not be considered clinically meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Consider the analogy of a weight-loss drug that is better than placebo at producing weight loss, but the difference is only 100 grams,” said Martin Plöderl, a clinical psychologist at Paracelsus Medical University in Salzburg, Austria, and lead author of the study. “This difference is unlikely to be noticeable to the patient or their doctors or produce any difference in their overall condition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study, published in the &lt;a href="https://www.jclinepi.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Journal of Clinical Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;, identified a “novelty bias” in early trials, which were likely to be more positive, while later studies fail to confirm these effects. It concludes that the potential risks of harmful side-effects of fluoxetine are likely to outweigh any potential clinical benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The most common side-effects experienced by children on antidepressants are weight gain, sleep disturbance and concentration problems. They can also increase suicidal ideation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d37217ba-3be1-4be7-b54b-2ece81436567" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":8,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Children detained under Mental Health Act held for hours in A&amp;amp;E departments","elementId":"d37217ba-3be1-4be7-b54b-2ece81436567","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/12/children-mental-health-act-accident-emergency-departments-england-wales"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The authors also examined clinical guidelines in the US and Canada and found that just as in the UK, they ignored evidence that Prozac was clinically equivalent to placebo and continued to recommend its use for children and adolescents with depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Mark Horowitz, an associate professor of psychiatry at Adelaide University and a co-author of the study, said: “Fluoxetine is clearly clinically equivalent to placebo in its benefits, but is associated with greater side effects and risks. It is difficult to see how anyone can justify exposing young people to a drug with known harms when it has no advantage over placebo in its benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Guidelines should not recommend treatments that are equivalent to placebo. Many clinicians take the common-sense approach that we should seek to understand why the young person feels depressed and address the factors that are contributing to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Guidelines in the UK and around the world currently recommend treatments for children with depression that are not in line with the best evidence. This exposes young people to the risks of medication without any benefit over placebo.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The long-term effects of antidepressants in children and adolescents were “poorly understood” and research among adults showed risks included serious side effects that may be long-term and in some cases persist after stopping the medication, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Responding to the findings, a Nice spokesperson said: “Mental health is a priority for Nice and we recognise that depression in young people is a serious condition that affects each differently, which is why having a range of treatment options is essential for clinicians.

Microplastics typically measure between 1 micrometer and 5 millimeters, but nanoplastics are as small as 1 nanometer. This small size makes nanoplastics especially insidious and able to infiltrate bodily functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other research has corroborated the harmful effects of nanoplastics, including causing dementia, lung damage, and compromised immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why are nanoplastics important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Research data suggested that vulnerable populations may be at added risk from nanoplastic threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The observed disruption to the gut-liver-brain axis suggests that even low-dose exposure may pose systemic risks," the report said. "Vulnerable populations, including individuals with neurological or metabolic conditions and children, may therefore face heightened impacts from nanoplastic exposure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about nanoplastics?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Using less plastic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Using less plastic&lt;/a&gt; can reduce your environmental exposure to the particles that plastic sheds.

The change was posted Wednesday and first reported by&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/cdc-changes-webpage-to-say-vaccines-may-cause-autism-revising-prior-language-061e2dc2?mod=hp_lead_pos11" target="_blank"&gt; The Wall Street Journal.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-194da8" class="body-graf"&gt;Pediatricians and vaccine experts have long said that &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/autism-vaccines-kennedy-cause-spectrum-rcna180837" target="_blank"&gt;autism is among the most studied childhood conditions&lt;/a&gt; and that no credible research has ever suggested a link between it and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1a474d" class="body-graf"&gt;The messaging is an about-face to the agency’s decades of research showing that any link between vaccines and autism has been scrutinized time and time again and thoroughly debunked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-82096f" class="body-graf"&gt;Scientists, vaccinologists and autism researchers who’ve sought to identify possible causes were gobsmacked by the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-77f63d" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is madness,” Dr. Sean O’Leary, head of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ infectious diseases committee, said during a media briefing Thursday. O’Leary said that scientists have taken an exhaustive look at potential environmental causes of autism. “One thing that is very clear is that vaccines are not one of those things. They do not cause autism. Period.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc0c14" class="body-graf"&gt;The Autism Science Foundation said in a statement that the group is “appalled” by the change in CDC messaging, calling it “anti-vaccine rhetoric and outright lies about vaccines and autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-90c295" class="body-graf"&gt;“The idea that vaccines cause autism is not only scientifically false,” ASF director Alison Singer said during a media briefing, “it’s also profoundly stigmatizing to autistic people and to their families. It frames autism as being caused by parental action, as if autism is a preventable injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5fd1bf" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, the updated webpage also notes that the Department of Health and Human Services has launched “a comprehensive assessment” to examine the causes of autism. It’s unclear what the assessment will be or how it will be conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5284d8" class="body-graf"&gt;HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said the website had been updated “to reflect gold standard, evidence-based science.” A question about how the agency defines such science wasn’t immediately answered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-02d0af" class="body-graf"&gt;The new language comes just ahead of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee meeting scheduled for Dec. 4-5, where members are expected to vote on changing the childhood schedule for hepatitis B vaccines. When the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices met in September, the panel &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-panel-hep-b-babies-data-rcna232394" target="_blank"&gt;delayed changing the guidance &lt;/a&gt;that all newborns should be vaccinated against the incurable infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-af0d74" class="body-graf"&gt;The Trump administration had previously demanded changes to the CDC website, notably insisting that anything related to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/federal-health-workers-terrified-dei-website-publishes-list-targets-rcna190711" target="_blank"&gt;diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, be erased&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8239d8" class="body-graf"&gt;This latest revision “crossed the line,” said Dr. Jesse Goodman, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University Medical Center and former chief scientist with the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ab51ee" class="body-graf"&gt;The administration has “hijacked the premiere public health industry to pursue a narrow agenda of spreading inaccurate information about vaccines,” Goodman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-87cdcc" class="body-graf"&gt;The new CDC messaging wasn’t reflected across the agency’s website, however. A&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-children/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt; page for parents&lt;/a&gt; states that “scientific studies and reviews continue to show no relationship between vaccines and autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-752739" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, the revision was the clearest signal yet that the CDC may no longer be a source for objective scientific findings and advice.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1e0e68" class="body-graf"&gt;“In my deepest heart, this is the day CDC died,” said a former CDC official who asked not to be named for safety reasons. “The public won’t care about nuance and individual websites now. Any messaging trying to distinguish some from all will sound tone deaf.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-037d62" class="body-graf"&gt;Changes on the CDC page seemed to contradict a commitment Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made to Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a Republican, during Kennedy’s confirmation hearing earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ccfe59" class="body-graf"&gt;During the hearing, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-confirmation-hearings-rfk-jr-kash-patel-tulsi-gabbard-takeaways-rcna189463" target="_blank"&gt;Cassidy told Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, “My concern is that if there is any false note, any undermining of a mama’s trust in vaccines, another person will die from a vaccine-preventable disease.” After getting assurances from&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/gop-sen-bill-cassidy-wavered-confirming-rfk-jr-says-lived-promises-vac-rcna206882" target="_blank"&gt; Kennedy not to undermine faith in vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, Cassidy voted to confirm him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-10f8f6" class="body-graf"&gt;A key section on the page kept the heading, “Vaccines do not cause Autism,” but with an asterisk added. Following that is a newly added asterisk noting the heading is there “due to an agreement with the chair of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that it would remain on the CDC website.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3dd0cc" class="body-graf"&gt;One CDC staffer not permitted to speak to the media said they read the Cassidy reference as “a direct middle finger” to the senator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-482081" class="body-graf"&gt;Cassidy didn’t respond to a request for comment. He later &lt;a href="https://x.com/senbillcassidy/status/1991599014270365829?s=46&amp;amp;t=mDcaBB75OPLoWR-8UuXfbA" target="_blank"&gt;posted on X&lt;/a&gt; that “vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7af614" class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy has long been known as an anti-vaccine activist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-282a02" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said the update to the CDC webpage is a nod to anti-vaccine activists that Kennedy hasn’t forgotten them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-308ce0" class="body-graf"&gt;“He’s signaling to his tribe that he’s there and he’s doing their bidding,” Adalja said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-bb51b3" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do the autism studies really show?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-696a7c" class="body-graf"&gt;Some scientists and doctors accused the CDC of cherry-picking studies that raise doubt about the relationship between autism and vaccines, and misrepresenting data or omitting credible studies that don’t show an association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e204d0" class="body-graf"&gt;“They’re taking evidence of safety and pretending it shows uncertainty. And I think that’s in a lot of ways actually worse than citing bad studies, because it’s corrupting good ones,” said Dr. Jake Scott, an infectious diseases specialist at Stanford Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-43da5f" class="body-graf"&gt;For instance, the CDC webpage points to &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997" target="_blank"&gt;a large Danish study&lt;/a&gt; from July, which found that aluminum exposure from vaccines during the first two years of life was not associated with increased rates of neurodevelopmental disorders. The study looked at more than 1.2 million children over roughly two decades and is considered one of the most robust pieces of evidence that vaccines and autism aren’t linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-392878" class="body-graf"&gt;“If aluminum in vaccines were causing autism or other chronic conditions, that study would have found it,” Scott said. “But ironically, they actually found slightly lower rates of autism with higher aluminum exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-191a8f" class="body-graf"&gt;However, the CDC webpage highlights a supplementary figure in the study suggesting an increased risk of Asperger’s syndrome in a tiny subset of children. Scott described the result as a “statistical blip.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d99c1" class="body-graf"&gt;“When you test 50 different conditions, you expect to see a couple of outliers just by pure chance. That’s just basic statistics,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-add670" class="body-graf"&gt;The webpage also cites two reports from the Institute of Medicine (now known as the National Academy of Medicine) — from 1991 and 2012 — suggesting there wasn’t enough data to say whether the pertussis vaccine causes autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a3111" class="body-graf"&gt;“Those reports actually rejected links between vaccines and autism,” Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-274bb0" class="body-graf"&gt;Other studies cited on the CDC webpage that cast doubt on the safety of vaccines aren’t well conducted, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2ba449" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC references a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25189402/" target="_blank"&gt;2014 study&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that aluminum in vaccines given to infants may be associated with a rise in autism cases. Scott said the study merely showed that two things happened at the same time — autism cases rose and the number of aluminum-containing vaccines given to children went up — not that they’re connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-782eec" class="body-graf"&gt;“The classic analogy is like saying ice cream sales cause drowning, because both increase in the summertime,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b5a47b" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC webpage also points to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21058170/" target="_blank"&gt;2010 study&lt;/a&gt;, which suggested that boys vaccinated for hepatitis B as newborns had a threefold higher risk of autism compared with boys who were vaccinated later or never vaccinated. The study was based on parent surveys rather than medical records. Studies using medical records have found no link, Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bcf681" class="body-graf"&gt;“They’re not mentioning the dozens of other studies that have failed to show an association,” Alycia Halladay, chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation, said of the CDC’s updated webpage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cdfa18" class="body-graf"&gt;One study that’s “blatantly missing,” she said, is a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2275444" target="_blank"&gt;2015 analysis&lt;/a&gt; that considered the hereditary nature of autism. The researchers found that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine was not associated with increased risk of autism, even among children with a higher risk of the disorder because their older siblings had it. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8607336/" target="_blank"&gt;massive review in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, which evaluated 138 studies, also found that MMR vaccines don’t cause autism, but was not cited on the CDC webpage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7ec49a" class="body-graf"&gt;The bulk of research cements any doubt for ASF’s Alison Singer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-af806f" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“At some point you have to say that this question is asked and answered, just like we no longer study whether the Earth is flat or round,” she said. “Enough is enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 22:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPSlM1UzZXd0pVa0F1TEJlUmE5ZndObzM2Y2c5OGEyalVIaFdGUnlINEtuMjJfUlNDQzd6TzhoVE1oYUJUcHZ6WFBzNV9jT2FxY0RpeFBJT3Z5RXpLZ3YxaWFZWjY3S3RzZFJOUTRhZ2tjcEFfUG5haHhQb0U3V2dMVV9MUm9tc25wTWVXbW1jSUJzSFd3YzEyQm9neDhvTzkwLWhlTjU2Wl9rQdIBVkFVX3lxTFA2c01WbDdpa3lDT0VPNDVzZkUwaG00VGllcG1KOWdGZFdSRXZDSDQ1QnUtdmEtNW1mM042TUVOOUFVcDJPalNyVlJkeDBpQ2xzem9DQ1Zn</guid></item><item><title>早期研究发现，杀死血管中的“僵尸细胞”可能是治疗糖尿病的关键- Live Science</title><link>https://www.livescience.com/health/diabetes/slaying-zombie-cells-in-blood-vessels-could-be-key-to-treating-diabetes-early-study-finds</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto paywall-locker"&gt;

But researchers are still trying to identify specific cells in which senescence is harmful, as opposed to beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, researchers chose to focus on blood vessel cells, which are critical for the function of most organs and have been shown to help control metabolism in many tissues, study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://researchers.cedars-sinai.edu/Nicolas.Musi" target="_blank" data-url="https://researchers.cedars-sinai.edu/Nicolas.Musi" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Nicolas Musi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of medicine at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-T8ibjQwDbPveCMinmRtw5P" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-T8ibjQwDbPveCMinmRtw5P slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify whether these cells were key drivers of metabolic disorders, the researchers fed one set of lab mice a high-fat diet to raise their body weights and induce senescence in their cells; they then removed their senescent endothelial cells for further study. In addition, the team exposed a different set of endothelial cells to radiation to induce senescence and then transplanted those cells into lean lab mice with normal metabolisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing senescent endothelial cells from the obese mice was associated with reduced fat mass, improved blood sugar levels and an overall reduction of metabolic dysfunction. Conversely, transplanting senescent cells into lean mice was associated with higher blood sugar levels and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When these cells go into this dormant state of senescence, they start producing inflammatory substances that are called Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP)," Musi said. This mechanism helps explain why removing senescent cells was associated with an improved metabolic rate. Cells usually take nutrients from the bloodstream, such as fat and glucose, to create the energy they need to function properly. But when they encounter the onslaught of inflammatory molecules from SASP cells, that process gets derailed, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cellular metabolism gets altered, and that translates into abnormal tissue and then abnormal whole-body metabolism," Musi told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-d4a83e92-0cc2-414e-8d39-35260bbabfc5" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="senolytics-are-potential-treatments-3"&gt;'Senolytics' are potential treatments &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="d8797d97-c396-4816-ae00-7034c575ef6d"&gt;In a second phase of the study, the researchers treated both groups of mice with fisetin, a drug that the team previously found could eliminate senescent cells. This type of drug is known as a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7405395/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7405395/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;senolytic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In both groups, treatment with fisetin was associated with fewer senescent blood-vessel cells and improved glucose tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also tested the drug on tissue samples from six adults with obesity who were in their 40s and 50s. They observed a similar decline in senescent blood vessel cells in the treated tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="c2f61185-8e21-4bff-beff-68d0395c8028"&gt;Aguayo-Mazzucato thinks this study could pave the way for new treatments targeting senescent cells in the cardiovascular system. "Metabolic dysfunction is a whole-body problem. You have nutrient utilization alterations in a lot of tissues," she said. Because senescent vascular cells are present throughout the entire body, targeting them in different organs could help doctors address a range of diseases, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rather than say we're going to treat cancer or we're going to treat diabetes, Alzheimer's [or] Parkinson's as defined entities, the idea is saying they're all age-related and there are pathways that are common to all age-related diseases," Aguayo-Mazzucato said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research should include &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/clinical-trials-and-studies/what-are-clinical-trials-and-studies" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/clinical-trials-and-studies/what-are-clinical-trials-and-studies" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;clinical studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that investigate whether senescence has the same effects in human blood vessels that were observed in lab mice, Suda said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="3798c96c-cc7b-4295-aea6-6225cf90dd27"&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;Consuming ultra-processed foods can cause harm to major organs, in addition to a host of other health problems, a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/series-do/ultra-processed-food" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published Tuesday in the medical journal the Lancet revealed. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.70086" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Another report&lt;/a&gt; released Thursday from researchers at Virginia Tech shows that young adults are more vulnerable to indulging in ultra-processed foods, according to Brenda Davy, a professor in the school’s Department of Human Nutrition, Foods and Exercise, who helped conduct the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davy told WTOP that people need to pay attention to what they’re buying to avoid ultra-processed food, which are dangerous to our health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An ultra-processed food is most easily recognized by having ingredients that would not be used in home cooking,” Davy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her study tested young adults who were put on diets with ultra-processed foods. After two weeks, the adults aged 18 to 21 ate more calories using a diet that was high in ultra-processed food even though they weren’t hungry. But this wasn’t true for adults in the 22-25 age group, Davy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s results suggest that adolescents may be more vulnerable to ultra-processed foods, which can be addictive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of ultra-processed foods include “things like Sunny Delight, rather than 100% fresh orange juice,” she said. “A Pop-Tart, which would be an ultra-processed food, compared to a homemade banana nut muffin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you’re shopping at the grocery store, if you pick up an item and look at the ingredient list, if you see things like ‘fat, flour, oil, salt, sugar,’ those are things that are typically used in home cooking,” she said. “Those would not be considered ultra-processed ingredients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On the other hand, if you saw very long-sounding chemical names that you do not recognize, that’s one tip off of an item considered an ultra-processed food,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said the research released this week shows that these ingredients could be more dangerous than you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ultra-processed foods are linked to increased risks of obesity and weight gain and a whole host of chronic diseases like Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases,” Davy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said in order to avoid ultra-processed foods, people should “prepare as many of their meals as possible at home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That might help folks reduce their risk of some of these chronic diseases related to their diet,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davy said that there are some advantages to food processing by manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the biggest advantages for using processed foods is that they do have a longer shelf life,” she said. “That is an important benefit of ultra-processed foods.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she said that one of the big drawbacks is how addictive they can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They may drive us to overeat them,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

This means the flu shots are mismatched to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/viruses" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the virus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the virus&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/best-time-get-flu-vaccine-fall-influenza-season-approaches" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Best Time To Get The Flu Vaccine This Fall As Influenza Season Approaches;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Time To Get The Flu Vaccine This Fall As Influenza Season Approaches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current strain also has a history of producing more severe illnesses and higher hospitalization rates, according to the doctor. Meanwhile, the virus continues to mutate, making it harder for immune systems to recognize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Download The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click Here To Download The Fox News App&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The flu virus is constantly mutating in small amounts to evade our immune system," Jhaveri noted, which is the main reason new vaccines are developed each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus seems to be spreading earlier than usual this year, and researchers aren’t entirely sure why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The current strain of flu has a history of producing more severe illnesses and higher hospitalization rates.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jhaveri noted that while the timing of the flu season can vary from year to year, there may now be a shift in how different &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/respiratory-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:respiratory viruses;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;respiratory viruses&lt;/a&gt; interact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the past, we used to see flu start to emerge when RSV was past its peak circulation," he said. "Now that we have more prevention options for RSV, the overall respiratory virus pattern may have shifted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s still recommended that people get vaccinated, Glanville emphasized, but protection will be "partial at best and worse than normal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;"Now that we have more prevention options for RSV, the overall respiratory virus pattern may have shifted."&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu immunity may also be weaker this year. As Jhaveri pointed out, immunity "increases after vaccination and natural infection" but wanes over time, especially in &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/geriatric-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:older adults;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, based on Australia’s data, "we think the vaccine should offer the usual levels of protection," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-risk individuals — including those with chronic conditions, weakened immune systems or obesity, as well as pregnant women and young children — should take extra caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"About half the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/childrens-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:children who die from flu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;children who die from flu&lt;/a&gt; and flu-related complications have no prior risk factor," Jhaveri noted, emphasizing that vaccination remains "the first step in preventing flu."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here For More Health Stories;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here For More Health Stories&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those hesitant to visit a clinic, a nasal spray vaccine was recently approved for either self-administration or for parents and caregivers, allowing families to vaccinate at home, Jhaveri noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glanville's company, Centivax, is "developing a universal flu vaccine, entering human trials in early 2026," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/doctors-reveal-troubling-signs-early-flu-trends-warn-unusually-bad-season" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Doctors reveal troubling signs in early flu trends, warn of ‘unusually bad’ season;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Doctors reveal troubling signs in early flu trends, warn of ‘unusually bad’ season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 22:03:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNV0NpcEFhOVVKN3R6V25iUmViSzdGcl83RzRrcnlrOEFMWVkwUVZTSGxrZXVEQVJzMmItbThtd1JkNnlteDI5WHNlZElMcXNIVGE3YTN2WDM0TnFlRG9kX2VCNWhnNGNtZklwcXFnbnI0Sno5MmVza2lBSndqZ0JfZktjVm03ZE0</guid></item><item><title>在经历了前所未有的自闭症疫苗信息传递变化后，科学家、倡导者表示， CDC不再值得信赖- CIDRAP</title><link>https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/after-unprecedented-autism-vaccine-messaging-change-scientists-advocates-say-cdc</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For nearly 80 years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was respected around the world for its authoritative, evidence-based leadership in public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the CDC’s stunning reversal Wednesday—stating on its website that “studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism”—shows the agency can no longer be trusted, multiple doctors and public health advocates told CIDRAP News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until late yesterday, the CDC webpage accurately stated, “Studies have shown that there is no link between receiving vaccines and developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD).&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;No links have been found between any vaccine ingredients and ASD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the CDC website echoes the views of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has claimed without evidence that vaccines cause autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/autism.html"&gt;website now states,&lt;/a&gt; “The claim ‘vaccines do not cause autism’ is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A 'tragic day' for public health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of a global leader in science, the CDC has devolved into “a propaganda machine for RFK Jr.'s fixed, immutable, science-resistant theories,” said Paul Offit, MD, an infectious disease specialist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine. “The CDC is being weaponized to promote RFK Jr.’s anti-vaccine point of view. So why should you trust it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many public health experts who spoke to CIDRAP News sounded sorrowful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today is a tragic day for public health, for the US government,” said Michael T. Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (publisher of CIDRAP News). “Ideology has replaced science as the means for addressing life-saving research and best practices that save lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many physicians worry that the CDC’s new message will dissuade parents from vaccinating their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This will cause real harm,” said Jake Scott, MD, an infectious disease expert and clinical associate professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parents searching for trustworthy information will find official CDC language that appears to validate concerns that have been thoroughly debunked. Some will delay or skip vaccines. We know what happens next—preventable diseases return to communities with low vaccination rates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC also removed scientific reviews of vaccines from its website. The website now rehashes conspiracy theories claiming that government scientists and the medical community have hidden the truth about vaccines, claiming, that “studies supporting a link have been ignored by health authorities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know what happens next—preventable diseases return to communities with low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attacking scientists as dishonest and corrupt comes straight out of the anti-vaccine playbook, said Peter Hotez, MD, codirector of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, who also helped develop an affordable, unpatented COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is how the wellness influencer industry works,” Hotez said. “It’s not enough to push the snake oil. You have to discredit mainstream biomedical science and portray scientists as public enemies or cartoon villains, and that's what Kennedy’s seeking to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC employees &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/public-health/public-health-officials-face-grim-new-reality-after-cdc-shooting"&gt;became the target of violence&lt;/a&gt; in August after a gunman who blamed COVID-19 shots for his depression &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/in-cdc-attack-man-fired-180-shots-breaking-150-windows"&gt;fired 180 shots into the agency’s&lt;/a&gt; Atlanta headquarters, killing a police officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vaccines don’t cause autism&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent researchers from seven countries have conducted 40 high-quality studies involving 5.6 million people looking at the relationship between vaccines and autism since 1998. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The conclusion is clear and unambiguous: There’s no link between vaccines and autism,” said Susan J. Kressly, MD, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anyone repeating this harmful myth is misinformed or intentionally trying to mislead parents,” Kressley said. “We call on the CDC to stop wasting government resources to amplify false claims that sow doubt in one of the best tools we have to keep children healthy and thriving: routine immunizations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his confirmation hearing, Kennedy promised Sen. Bill Cassidy, MD, a Republican from Louisiana, that he would not remove statements on the CDC website that said vaccines do not cause autism. Cassidy's approval was critical in confirming Kennedy as HHS secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone repeating this harmful myth is misinformed or intentionally trying to mislead parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cassidy didn’t respond to an interview request. But he &lt;a href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1991599014270365829"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; about the importance of vaccines on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a doctor who has seen people die from vaccine-preventable diseases,” Cassidy wrote. “What parents need to know right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible and actively makes Americans sicker.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s rejection of vaccine science undercuts the credibility of all federal government science, said Ari Ne’eman, PhD, an assistant professor of health policy and management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It gives people justifiable cause to be suspicious about anything that comes out from this administration regarding the science of autism,” Ne’eman said. “This reinforces this sense that RFK Jr.’s political judgments are being used in place of the scientific process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debra Houry, MD, the CDC’s former chief medical officer, said the agency’s scientists had nothing to do with the website change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Scientists were not involved in any of these decisions, and when you remove science from scientific information you get ideology,” said Houry, who resigned from the CDC in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“T&lt;span&gt;his is what we have been warning Congress about—and yesterday on a webinar for health journalists I said I would not trust information on autism from CDC&lt;/span&gt;,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, allies of Kennedy are cheering the changes. "This is the biggest health reversal of our lifetime," Children's Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group founded by Kennedy, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/childrenshd/status/1991515222775906323?s=43&amp;amp;t=0dtS1Ti4eIH_z6yy-SmqoQ"&gt;&lt;span&gt;said on X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Autism community speaks out&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The autism community, which has long pushed back against the idea that vaccines cause autism, also criticized the changes to the CDC website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No environmental factor has been better studied as a potential cause of autism,” said Alison Singer, MBA, president of the Autism Science Foundation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The facts don’t change because the administration does,” Singer said. “At this point it’s not about doing more studies; it’s about being willing to accept what the existing study data clearly show. You can’t just ignore data because it doesn’t confirm your beliefs, but that’s what the administration is doing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autistic people have been sharply critical of Kennedy for his demeaning characterizations of people with the condition and description of the neurodevelopmental condition as a tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can’t just ignore data because it doesn’t confirm your beliefs, but that’s what the administration is doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It isn’t clear what further amount or type of proof or research would be enough to satisfy Kennedy or the CDC that autism isn’t caused by vaccines,” said Sam Brandsen, PhD, who has autism and is a part-time postdoctoral researcher at the University of Alberta in Canada. Brandsen’s son also has autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if vaccines were the cause of autism—which I don't believe—I would much rather have my child be his wonderful autistic self and have vaccine protection against deadly diseases than try to withhold necessary vaccines out of a fear of autistic traits,” Brandsen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

She took antibiotics for seven to 10 days and was starting to feel better. However, just two months later her health took a turn for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Towards the end of August I started to have pain in my jaw and cheek and then in the left side of my neck,” she told Kennedy News and Media via &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/health/15520606/hands-feet-black-toxic-shock-syndrome-jaw-pain-amputation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Sun;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “I thought it was just my glands swelling up to take care of an infection or whatever was happening in my jaw.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Haley initially thought she was experiencing a flare up of her TMJ disorder, a condition that causes pain in the jaw joint and muscles. But when it progressed to neck swelling and vomiting, the 41-year-old sought medical advice and was immediately rushed to the hospital on August 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“That was the last thing I remember,” she recalled. “One minute I was fine and the next minute I wasn’t fine and I was rushed to ICU.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News &amp;amp; Media &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jane Haley after her quadruple limb amputation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Haley’s heart rate and blood pressure plummeted and she was placed in a medically induced coma. There, she was diagnosed with Group A Streptococcus, which had progressed into &lt;a href="https://people.com/health/pennsylvania-mother-toxic-shock-syndrome-recovery/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:toxic shock syndrome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;toxic shock syndrome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://people.com/health/lauren-wasser-toxic-shock-syndrome-risks/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Toxic shock syndrome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Toxic shock syndrome&lt;/a&gt; (TSS) is a rare, but life-threatening condition that develops from toxins within the body.

Photos show that her hands and feet also started to turn black from tissue damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It was devastating at the time to see my hands,” she explained. “My feet hadn’t changed color at the time so I had a bit of hope that I would still walk. It took only two weeks for my hands to look how they looked in the photos, it happened rapidly.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She was ultimately told that saving her life meant she needed her limbs amputated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On September 29, after spending a month in the hospital, Haley was airlifting to another hospital to undergo a double hand amputation on October 1. And less than two weeks later, she had her legs amputated below the knee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News &amp;amp; Media &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jane Haley's hands after suffering tissue damage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-puzzler-8620185" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here!

Play now&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;By that point, Haley admitted that she was “desperate” to have the amputations because she was in so much pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It was disgusting that the bottom of my foot was black and it looked almost like an insole. The dead skin was separating from the old skin, the pain was constant,” she told the outlet. “It started out as a little crater [on my foot] and this got bigger and bigger [until the dead skin] could flap at me when I flexed my foot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It was so extremely painful that I thought anything had to be better than this. I was ready to go and get this amputated,” she continued. “It was either save my life or save my limbs and the doctors chose to save my life. I’m happy that they made this decision as I’m still here to talk about it today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Haley is now in recovery, and her family has created a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-our-cousin-jane-rebuild-her-after-quadruple-amputation" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; account to help cover her lengthy rehabilitation. She requires physical and mental health therapy, adaptive and mobility devices and eventually prosthetics to help her live independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“All I’m doing now is I’m in survival mode and I’m looking forward [to my future],” she shared. “I’m happy to be living each day and approaching things that people take for granted every day. I’ve had several moments where I’ve broken down but I think for the most part I am a strong person. I don’t like to look back and say ‘what if?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If I put myself in this mindset it brings down my whole day,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Haley’s now hoping that sharing her story will raise awareness about the severity of her “scary” infection and getting treatment early because it could happen to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This could have happened to anyone and it’s a silent killer.

Kennedy Jr.’s priorities, according to an internal agency memo obtained by STAT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The list, which acting CDC Director Jim O’Neill shared with employees, includes “enhancing scientific rigor,” new disease surveillance tools, “downsizing” animal testing, and increasing screening for hepatitis B in pregnant women. The new programs aren’t yet finalized, with details expected in January.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The initiatives offer a view into the administration’s plans for an agency that has been at the center of Kennedy’s reform agenda — and one that has been battered &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/08/cdc-campus-attacked-kennedy-crisis/"&gt;by a shooting&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/cdc-director-fired-behind-the-scenes-look/"&gt;firing of a new director&lt;/a&gt; less than a month into her role, and politics &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/16/cdc-turmoil-senate-testimony-susan-monarez-debra-houry/"&gt;overpowering scientific processes&lt;/a&gt;. The news was &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-20/hhs-proposes-new-cdc-programs-including-hepatitis-b-screening" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;first reported by Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

From childhood hospital beds to her early twenties spent tethered to IV lines and feeding pumps, her life has been shaped by relentless pain, chronic illness and the slow disintegration of her organs. Now, after years of fighting a disease that has stolen every part of her youth, Annaliese has chosen to end her life through voluntary assisted dying. As she explained in an interview with News.com.au, the decision came after a lifetime of worsening symptoms and unrelenting decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up in Adelaide, Annaliese endured years of unexplained agony. Doctors struggled to understand why she vomited constantly, why her stomach failed to empty, and why even the simplest bodily functions became impossible. It was only when she turned 18 and moved into adult care that she finally received a name for her suffering: autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy (AAG), a rare disorder in which the immune system attacks the nerves controlling involuntary functions such as digestion, heart rate and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A life defined by pain, fractures and failing organs from birth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As AAG progressed, Annaliese’s digestive system essentially stopped working. Her bowel behaved as though blocked, despite nothing physically obstructing it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeding tubes were inserted, but she continued vomiting. Eventually she was placed on total parenteral nutrition, dependent on an IV line for all nutrients. This brought its own dangers. Any infection entering the line could spread to her bloodstream within hours. She survived sepsis 25 times, each episode a fight for her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to People magazine, the medications required to manage her symptoms came with devastating consequences. Annaliese developed severe osteoporosis in her early twenties, suffering four spinal fractures, a cracked sternum and dangerously high pressure on her heart and lungs. Her body became fragile and unpredictable, a daily battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are beautiful moments,” she said, “but they are exhausting. I am in chronic, debilitating pain every single day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Watching life move without her&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her friends moved into adulthood, with engagements, weddings and new babies, Annaliese remained confined to hospital rooms and her bed at home. Birthdays passed unnoticed behind curtains and machines. She described the feeling as being stuck in place, watching everyone else race ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No man wants to date someone dying,” she admitted quietly. “I understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the age of 22, doctors told her what she had feared: her condition was terminal. Multi-organ failure had begun. Her body could no longer tolerate regular feeding. Sepsis lurked behind every medical procedure. The future held only pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of fighting, Annaliese realised she wanted to reclaim the one thing her disease had not yet taken: her autonomy. She applied for voluntary assisted dying (VAD), a process that required extensive medical assessments and psychological evaluations before approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A choice made with clarity&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the approval finally came, after three weeks of scrutiny, Annaliese cried with relief. “It sounds strange to be happy about it,” she said, “but I finally felt a little bit of peace.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;She emphasised that choosing VAD was not surrender. “It is not giving up. It is knowing you have fought for so long and so hard, and you cannot keep suffering like this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her decision devastated her family. Her mother, Amanda, still prays for a miracle, even as she understands the unbearable reality her daughter faces. Her father, Patrick, initially begged her to keep fighting until he watched doctors resuscitate her yet again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;She remembers turning to him and pleading: “Dad, please let me go. I will not hate you. I just cannot do this anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;That moment changed everything. “I totally understand,” he finally told her. “You have had enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Choosing dignity at the end of a long fight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Annaliese, the decision is not about death, but about relief from pain, from fear and from the dread of waking each day in a failing body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel lucky to have this choice,” she said. “It is one of the bravest things you can do, to say you have had enough. I have fought bloody hard.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In choosing her own ending, she is taking back the small piece of life her disease never controlled: her final say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 20:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingJBVV95cUxPS0lpRjg0QjNVU3J0SE1OVmFtblhiRFJ6djdlR01jenlUWWU5S2s4c3FwWDdQUUItcVhOZnRFdEVvMEw0aTJ6UFVOR0o2eHZhbWF3YkFNaGxRd3AtNnctTjNmZWdwNk5LOElIQ2JGclk4VUJWMk5kQmZIZjBrX1JvU20xa1YyLTlvY1JraXN6QVNEa0NsdFBsMk9oT3MyT0JCNnpWRDE4Rzc1dzFtVGhYTzRpVGNNOGlaMEl1dGhUM1FCa25BNkZzUEFCTjFMc1Y4bWNuU0wxaFpJZUtoOHE5UjNpVFQ2V0Q5LVNyWHEydzZPbjBXeUc4THpWUDMxT1VXLV9tTmFpX2ZpS3YzRVhNSVZ6RHZyaERPV2pUQjRR</guid></item><item><title>自身免疫性疾病可以袭击身体的任何部位，主要影响女性。以下是须知事项- VINnews</title><link>https://vinnews.com/2025/11/20/autoimmune-diseases-can-strike-any-part-of-the-body-and-mostly-affect-women-heres-what-to-know/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content tagdiv-type"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are called autoimmune diseases can affect just about every part of the body — even the brain — and tens of millions of people. While most common in women, these diseases can strike anyone, adults or children, and they’re on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New research is raising the prospect of treatments that might do more than tamp down symptoms. Dozens of clinical trials are testing ways to reprogram an out-of-whack immune system. Furthest along is a cancer treatment called CAR-T therapy that’s had some promising early successes against lupus, myositis and certain other illnesses. It wipes out immune system B cells — both rogue and normal ones — and the theory is those that grow back are healthier. Other researchers are hunting ways to at least delay brewing autoimmune diseases, spurred by a drug that can buy some time before people show symptoms of Type 1 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is probably the most exciting time that we’ve ever had to be in autoimmunity,” said Dr. Amit Saxena, a rheumatologist at NYU Langone Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some things to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are autoimmune diseases?&lt;br&gt;
They’re chronic diseases that can range from mild to life-threatening, more than 100 with different names depending on how and where they do damage. Rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis attack joints. Sjögren’s disease is known for dry eyes and mouth. Myositis and myasthenia gravis weaken muscles in different ways, the latter by attacking how nerves signal them. Lupus has widely varied symptoms including a butterfly-shaped facial rash, joint and muscle pain, fevers and damage to the kidneys, lungs and heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can even hijack the organ that makes us “us” — the brain, with what’s called autoimmune encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re also capricious: Even patients faring well for long periods can suddenly have a “flare” for no apparent reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why autoimmune diseases are so difficult to diagnose&lt;br&gt;
Many start with vague symptoms that come and go or mimic other illnesses. Many also have overlapping symptoms — rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren’s also can harm major organs, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis can take multiple tests, including some blood tests to detect antibodies that mistakenly latch onto healthy tissue. It usually centers on symptoms and involves ruling out other causes. Depending on the disease it can take years and seeing multiple doctors before one puts the clues together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are efforts to improve. The National MS Society is educating doctors about newly updated guidelines to streamline diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. And scientists are discovering a growing list of rogue antibodies responsible for the memory loss, seizures, even psychosis that can signal autoimmune encephalitis. That’s helping doctors better identify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How the immune system gets out of whack&lt;br&gt;
The human immune system is a complex army with sentinels to detect threats like germs or cancer cells, a variety of soldiers to attack them, and peacemakers to calm things down once the danger is over. Key is that it can distinguish what’s foreign from what’s “you,” what scientists call tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes confused immune cells or antibodies slip through, or the peacemakers can’t calm things down after a battle. If the system can’t spot and fix the problem, autoimmune diseases gradually develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autoimmune diseases are often set off by a trigger&lt;br&gt;
Most autoimmune diseases, especially in adults, aren’t caused by a specific gene defect. Instead, a variety of genes that affect immune functions can make people susceptible. Scientists say it then takes some “environmental” trigger, such as an infection, smoking or pollutants, to set the disease into motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are zeroing in on the earliest molecular triggers. For example, white blood cells called neutrophils are first responders to signs of infection or injury — but abnormally overactive ones are suspected of playing a key role in lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New research links a virus to lupus&lt;br&gt;
Among infectious triggers, scientists already know the Epstein-Barr virus can set some people on the path to multiple sclerosis — and new evidence links it to lupus, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just about everybody gets that virus by young adulthood and after the initial infection, it still hides out, inactive, in the body. Stanford University researchers found a hiding place is in a tiny proportion of the immune system’s B cells. They found that occasionally, in some people, the virus nudges certain B cells into an inflammatory state that can spur an autoimmune chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research doesn’t explain why 95% adults have been infected with Epstein-Barr yet only a small fraction of the population gets lupus. But it’s a new clue into how infections can have a lasting impact on the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women are at highest risk for autoimmune diseases&lt;br&gt;
Women account for about 4 of 5 autoimmune patients, many of them young. Hormones are thought to play a role. But also, females have two X chromosomes while males have one X and one Y. Some research suggests an abnormality in how female cells switch off that extra X can increase women’s vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But men do suffer from autoimmune diseases. One especially severe one named VEXAS syndrome wasn’t discovered until 2020. It mainly affects men over 50 and in addition to typical autoimmune symptoms it can cause blood clots, shortness of breath and night sweats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain populations also have higher risks. For example, lupus is more common in Black and Hispanic women. Northern Europeans have a higher risk of MS than other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment for autoimmune diseases is complicated&lt;br&gt;
According to investment research company Morningstar, the global market for autoimmune disease treatments is $100 billion a year. That’s not counting doctor visits and such things as lost time at work. Treatment is lifelong and, while usually covered by insurance, can be pricey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so long ago there was little to offer for many autoimmune diseases beyond high-dose steroids and broad immune-suppressing drugs, with side effects that include a risk of infections and cancer. Today some newer options target specific molecules, somewhat less immune dampening. But for many autoimmune diseases, treatment is trial and error, with little to guide patient decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

Many health professionals now encourage individuals to look beyond calorie counts and pay attention to how different carbohydrates behave inside the body. In a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRPRDkajcT1/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;recent reel, Holistic Health Nutritionist Khushi Chhabra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; explained how people with prediabetes or diabetes may see a noticeable drop in glucose spikes when they replace refined carbohydrates with slower digesting, nutrient rich options. Her explanation echoes current scientific interest in whole grains and fibre dense plant foods that release glucose more steadily. Understanding how these foods work helps create everyday meals that support calmer and more predictable metabolic patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5 everyday carbs that help maintain stable glucose&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her reel, Holistic Health Nutritionist Khushi Chhabra explained that individuals with prediabetes or diabetes may experience a significant reduction in glucose spikes when they shift from refined carbohydrates to more nutrient dense alternatives. She said that “changing just your carbs can drop your sugar spikes by 30 to 50 percent,” emphasising the value of foods that digest more slowly and support more stable energy patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her guidance highlights five everyday carbohydrate swaps that, when used regularly, may contribute to steadier glucose release, improved satiety and more balanced insulin responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Causes and prevention of prediabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her recommended options include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;keyword id="626871" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="jowar" source="Orion"&gt;Jowar&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;keyword id="573117" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="quinoa" source="Orion"&gt;Quinoa&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;keyword id="110678" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="oats" source="Orion"&gt;Oats&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;keyword id="626872" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="ragi" source="Orion"&gt;Ragi&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;keyword id="1476505" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="sweet-potato" source="Orion"&gt;Sweet potato&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.

This makes jowar especially useful for people who experience sharp post meal sugar increases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/8/2205" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research published in Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; examined resistant starch intake and found meaningful reductions in postprandial glucose responses, showing how grains like jowar can influence metabolic behaviour. Its natural polyphenols have also been linked with improved insulin function, adding another layer of support for healthier glucose patterns throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key benefits include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Slower glucose entry due to resistant starch that stays intact during digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Better insulin activity supported by natural polyphenols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Longer lasting fullness because of its high fibre content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Quinoa&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quinoa was celebrated in the reel for its complete protein profile and mineral density, both of which influence glucose regulation. Its balanced amino acid structure slows digestion and helps prevent steep glucose rises after meals. Its magnesium content may also support insulin signalling, making quinoa a helpful choice for individuals aiming for smoother glucose responses. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11273950/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study in Antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; examined quinoa based meals and reported more stable postprandial glucose levels compared with refined grain meals. These research findings reinforce quinoa’s role as a nutrient rich carbohydrate option with significant metabolic advantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary advantages include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Slower carbohydrate breakdown thanks to its complete protein composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Support for insulin responsiveness through its magnesium content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Added satiety from its blend of protein, fibre and essential nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Oats &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oats were recommended in the reel for their ability to support more stable glucose outcomes due to beta glucan, a soluble fibre that forms a gel in the stomach. This gel slows the movement of food through the digestive tract and moderates the speed at which glucose enters the bloodstream. Beta glucan has been widely studied for its effects on blood sugar. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-021-00875-9" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;review in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that daily oat beta glucan intake led to lower postprandial glucose and insulin levels, highlighting its value for metabolic regulation. Fermentation of this fibre in the gut also produces short chain fatty acids that may support insulin sensitivity over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notable metabolic benefits include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Smoother glucose responses due to slower intestinal transit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• SCFA production through fibre fermentation, which may aid long term stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Better fullness and appetite control supported by soluble fibre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Ragi &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ragi was emphasised in the reel for having a naturally lower glycaemic load than wheat based staples. Its high fibre content, mineral profile and amino acid composition contribute to slower digestion and gentler glucose responses. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7270244/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in the Journal of Food Science and Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; compared finger millet meals with refined wheat alternatives and found significantly lower postprandial glucose levels in the ragi group. This suggests that ragi can be helpful for individuals who experience frequent cravings or energy dips linked to unstable glucose levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key benefits include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Slower glucose release supported by its fibre density.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Lower glycaemic load that produces gentler post meal patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Reduced cravings helped by its amino acids and nutrient rich composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="95"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Sweet potato&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="96"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khushi Chhabra described sweet potato as a more balanced option compared with regular potatoes or white rice because its starches break down more gradually. Its antioxidant profile, which includes beta carotene and anthocyanins, has been studied for potential benefits on metabolic inflammation and insulin behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S221242922200668X" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research published in Food Bioscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; examined sweet potato extracts and found improved insulin sensitivity and moderated glucose responses among participants. This combination of steady digestion and antioxidant activity makes sweet potato a helpful carbohydrate for individuals looking for consistent, sustained energy and more predictable glucose curves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="103"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="105"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Important advantages include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="107"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Gradual carbohydrate digestion that reduces fast glucose rises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="109"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Antioxidants that may support healthier insulin activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="111"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Smoother energy release due to its balanced fibre and starch content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="113"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.
