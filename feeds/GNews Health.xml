&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Millions of Americans have high cholesterol, which can lead to heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A bedtime snack rich in fiber and plant protein may help lower cholesterol. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a cholesterol-lowering late-night snack, our Chia Seed Pudding checks all the boxes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have high cholesterol, you’re not alone. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, millions of Americans have high cholesterol (aka hyperlipidemia).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This condition, defined as total blood &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/myths-about-high-cholesterol-to-stop-believing-8760519" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol levels higher than 200 mg/dL&lt;/a&gt;, is a leading risk factor for heart disease. However, that doesn’t mean you’re destined for heart troubles. “Keeping cholesterol levels in a healthy range helps reduce the risk of plaque buildup in the arteries, which can lead to heart disease over time,” says &lt;a href="https://www.topnutritioncoaching.com/registered-dietitians#kathleen-benson" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kathleen Benson, RDN, CSSD, CPT&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, healthy meals are the foundation of a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7836633/high-cholesterol-diet-plan-for-beginners/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol-lowering diet&lt;/a&gt;. But snacks can help, too—even the ones you eat before bed, like our ​​&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Chia Seed Pudding&lt;/a&gt;. It’s loaded with ingredients that can help reduce cholesterol. Yet, it’s light and satisfying enough that it won’t mess with your sleep. No wonder dietitians are huge fans. Here’s how it can help keep your heart healthy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-chia-pudding-is-great-for-high-cholesterol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why Chia Pudding Is Great for High Cholesterol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s High in Fiber  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the myriad benefits of enjoying a high-fiber diet is that it can help lower cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “When I have a client trying to manage high cholesterol levels, we focus on getting more fiber and healthier fats in their diet,” says &lt;a href="https://bebalancednutritionrd.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Meggie Connelly, M.S., RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. Filled with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seeds-benefits-11705262" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber-rich chia seeds&lt;/a&gt;, our Chia Seed Pudding delivers a hefty 11 grams of fiber per serving.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds contain a mix of both &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soluble and insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But it’s their soluble fiber that’s behind chia’s cholesterol-lowering powers. The reason? Soluble fiber can absorb some of the cholesterol in your gut, removing it from the body before it can cause trouble. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Low in Saturated Fat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Interestingly, research has shown that cholesterol from food doesn’t always affect your blood cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The real culprit is saturated fat, found mainly in full-fat dairy, red and processed meat, lard and ghee. Saturated fat tells your liver to rev up its cholesterol production, which provides far more cholesterol than the amount we absorb from food.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since this chia pudding is made with almond milk, it contains merely 1 gram of saturated fat per serving. If almond milk isn’t your thing, feel free to sub in another &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitians-favorite-plant-based-milk-11733338" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based milk&lt;/a&gt; like soy, cashew or oat milk or low-fat cow’s milk. Just steer clear of coconut milk and full-fat cow’s milk, which are both high in saturated fat. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Contains Plant Protein  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you have high cholesterol or not, choosing a late-night snack that contains some protein is the key to staying satiated all night long. “This will help you feel full during the night and help control blood sugar levels so you’re not starving by the morning,” says&lt;a href="https://www.brannoninbalancenutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Brannon Blount, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. Each serving of this chia pudding delivers 7 grams of protein. And not just any kind of protein. All of its protein is plant protein, which has been linked to better heart health. It’s so beneficial that the American Heart Association recommends getting most of our protein from plant sources like the chia seeds and nuts in this recipe.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-a-heart-healthy-bedtime-snack"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look For in a Heart-Healthy Bedtime Snack &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A combination of fiber and protein.&lt;/strong&gt; Consider this the magic duo. “Fiber and protein combined, or paired together with an assortment of foods, can support steady blood sugar and satiety,” Benson says. That’s important because chronically high blood sugar levels can lead to diabetes, which increases heart disease risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients that are easy to digest.&lt;/strong&gt; When you’re trying to get some quality zzz’s, the last thing you need to eat is something that will upset your tummy or delay sleep even further. Choose something light, easy to digest and satisfying, yet low in fat and added sugars. In addition to chia pudding, oatmeal, popcorn and cereal with low-fat milk are all great options.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something simple to assemble. &lt;/strong&gt;After a long day, it’s normal to experience some decision fatigue. But, instead of reaching for something with empty calories (we’re looking at you, bag of chips), choose something nutrient-dense that you can easily whip up. “Your late-night snack needs to be quick and easy to put together, like a banana and nut butter, or a peanut butter and sliced strawberry sandwich on whole-grain bread. Or make your chia pudding in advance,” says Connelly. “If you have to spend 30 minutes making your late-night snack, it’s not going to be something you do consistently.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Late-night snacking may get a bad rap, but if you didn’t eat enough during the day, a little nibble before bed might help you fall and stay asleep. That said, if you have high cholesterol, there are some considerations to keep in mind. If cholesterol is an issue, dietitians recommend choosing a snack that’s &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/heart-healthy-high-fiber-snack-recipes-8700225" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in fiber, low in saturated fat&lt;/a&gt; and contains some protein. Our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Chia Seed Pudding&lt;/a&gt; checks all the boxes. So, whip some up today. You can double (or even quadruple) the recipe. And it will stay fresh in your fridge for up to three days for a hassle-free bedtime snack your heart will thank you for. &lt;br&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;A dog in Raleigh is recovering after being bitten by a rabid
raccoon on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Animal Control was called to Windsor Trail in Raleigh on Thursday
after the dog had been bitten. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wake County Public Health and Wake County Animal Control
confirmed on Friday the raccoon tested positive for rabies. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;According to county officials, the dog was up to date on its
rabies vaccination and received a booster after being bitten. It is expected to
be ok. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Rabies is a serious public health concern, and we’re
grateful that this pet was protected through vaccination,” said Wake County
Commissioner Tara Waters. “This incident is an important reminder of why it’s
so critical to keep your pets up to date on their rabies shots.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Anyone in the area who may have encountered a raccoon is asked to call the Wake County Communicable Disease line at 919-250-4462. If a person or their
pet may have been bitten or scratched, officials advise seeking medical
attention right away. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;County officials have provided a list of tips to help
minimize rabies risks:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/rabid-raccoon-bites-dog-raleigh-june-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/rabid-raccoon-bites-dog-raleigh-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not approach animals that you do not know. Exercise caution and maintain a safe distance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have been bitten or scratched by an animal of unknown vaccination history, wash the wound immediately and seek medical attention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure your pets have a current rabies vaccination. If your pet is allowed outside, a booster vaccine is strongly recommended. Keep outdoor pets indoors until they receive the booster vaccines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not feed stray or unknown animals, including cats and dogs. Avoid any interaction that may result in potential exposure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not leave trash or food outside unless it is in a trash can with a tight-fitting lid. Prevent attracting wild animals to your property.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a pet is fed outside, do not leave food out overnight to minimize the chances of attracting animals that may carry rabies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a pet comes in contact with an animal that might be rabid, contact a veterinarian immediately. Seek professional guidance to ensure the well-being of your pet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

(WHAM) — &lt;a href="https://townandcountrysolutions.com/" target="_blank" title="https://townandcountrysolutions.com/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Town &amp;amp; Country Pest Solutions&lt;/a&gt; has been helping people locally and across the state get rid of pests for the last 40 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rats in general are horrible all over Rochester," said Caleb Fabry, the company's president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fabry said Town &amp;amp; Country's phones have been ringing nonstop for the last six months, with some of the worst infestations he's ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ten years ago, we would get calls, but it was here and there," he said. "(Now) we're seeing them every day. We're seeing some of the worst infestations we've ever seen in the Rochester area. I would say that it's aligning with what you would expect in a bigger city like New York City and things like that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the pest control company went out to a home in Gates whose owner had to be removed due to the condition of her home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a really sad situation," Fabry said. "She was living there last week, and her mattress is on the floor. She's an elderly lady."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fabry said the home was littered with urine and feces from pests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We go in there to evaluate how we can stop it, and there's rats everywhere," Fabry continued. "I'm telling you, she was just sleeping in this house a prior week. Rats everywhere. There was a chicken running around in the house.

In acute pain, neurons in the medullary dorsal horn reduce their activity through a natural “braking” system involving A-type potassium currents, helping limit pain signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in chronic pain, this mechanism fails, and the neurons become overactive, continuing to send pain messages. This discovery provides a clearer biological pathway for how pain becomes chronic and may guide future therapies aimed at restoring this internal regulation system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brainstem Relay Dysfunction:&lt;/strong&gt; In chronic pain, neurons in the medullary dorsal horn lose their ability to dampen pain signals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A-Type Potassium Current (IA):&lt;/strong&gt; This current acts as a brake in acute pain but fails to activate in chronic pain conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Implication:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting IA could be a novel strategy to prevent or treat chronic pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does some pain go away while other types linger, turning into chronic suffering? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking study from scientists at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem may have uncovered part of the answer — deep inside the brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111075"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In acute pain, IA increases — acting like a natural sedative for the pain pathways. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published this week in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, researchers led by Doctoral student Ben Title under the guidance of Prof. Alexander M. Binshtok from The Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Medicine and the Center for Brain Sciences (ELSC) at The Hebrew University, reveal that our bodies respond to acute (short-term) and chronic (long-lasting) pain in surprisingly different ways at the cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their discovery sheds new light on how pain becomes chronic — and opens the door to better-targeted treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Brain’s “Pain Relays” Behave Differently in Acute vs. Chronic Pain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The team studied a small but crucial region in the brainstem called the medullary dorsal horn, home to neurons that act as a relay station for pain signals. These projection neurons help send pain messages from the body to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that during acute inflammatory pain, these neurons actually dial down their own activity. This built-in “braking system” helps limit the amount of pain-related signals sent to the brain. Once the inflammation and pain subside, the neurons return to their normal state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in chronic pain, this braking system fails. The neurons don’t reduce their activity — in fact, they become more excitable and fire more signals, potentially contributing to the persistence of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Key Player: A-Type Potassium Current&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a combination of electrophysiology and computer modeling, the researchers identified a key mechanism: a specific potassium current known as the A-type potassium current (IA). This current helps regulate the excitability of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In acute pain, IA increases — acting like a natural sedative for the pain pathways. But in chronic pain, this current doesn’t ramp up, and the neurons become hyperactive. The absence of this regulation may be one of the biological switches that turns temporary pain into a long-lasting condition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Chronic Pain Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first time we’ve seen how the same neurons behave so differently in acute versus chronic pain,” said Prof. Binshtok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that this natural ‘calming’ mechanism is missing in chronic pain suggests a new target for therapy. If we can find a way to restore or mimic that braking system, we might be able to prevent pain from becoming chronic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Step Toward Smarter Pain Therapies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic pain affects over 50 million people in the U.S. alone, often with few effective treatment options. This new study adds an important piece to the puzzle by showing how the nervous system’s built-in pain controls are disrupted in long-term pain conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By understanding the brain’s own strategies for limiting pain — and why they sometimes fail — scientists are now one step closer to developing smarter, more precise therapies for those who suffer from chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this pain and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8eeaefe0efebe3edcefdeff8e7e1e0a0e6fbe4e7a0efeda0e7e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Danae Marx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://huji.ac.il" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Danae Marx – Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adr3467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Opposite regulation of medullary pain-related projection neuron excitability in acute and chronic pain&lt;/a&gt;” by Alexander M.

If seeking in-person medical attention, call ahead to inform your doctor, urgent care, or emergency room of the potential measles exposure before arrival so facilities may take precautions to prevent exposure to other individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, if it has been less than six days since the potential exposure, you may be able to receive post-exposure treatment that could prevent illness. Contact your healthcare provider, pharmacy, or local health department for vaccination and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GTCHD has a measles hotline that can be reached during normal business hours, Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at 231-995-6800. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the line will be monitored from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Saturday, June 21st, and from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Sunday, June 22nd.  If outside of office hours, Grand Traverse County residents can also contact 2-1-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Disease investigations performed by our local health department are critical to ensuring we can limit the impact of diseases such as measles in our community,” said Mike Lahey, Health Officer at GTCHD. "It is important to consider staying up-to-date on all routine vaccinations, including the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, to prevent the spread of severe illness and disease."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WPBN</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 20:15:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxNRjk0N1BvLTNRekJxNHpWbE1BVkhVQkVEMVRjLWxyWl9VbklRLThqcVVqOGpNdmFMVW5FOTFtdnlKa1NCTTFuNWw2U05ac29UU0ljVnBqZ19GOTljc3YyREQ3Sm1UMVU1Vkpxekk2UGVOdHJ0bE9MdEFNQXNxcnRmNVhmakVCM1REX204SkV1WkpPdG1TLUxBcGFxbHFOZ0hvcExDMUF3TDVCaU1MUHNJMXFFb0lvUFFVVTl4cw</guid></item><item><title>犹他县多年来首例麻疹病例报告- KSL新闻 | Utah's first measles case in years reported in Utah County - KSL News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxOM2oxcTFXUjhJZnNLR2xrUFVZUWhjci1vZ3o3WVI4SWZ0d2ptdnJiSWtVeGF4T0ZGUmVaNGVmR0d6SVp4NFRnaENOUzhyZk5kZWdtMmRTVjVDZllEclFjN1VhQTBXYW55Zjk0Q2Q1LWZDY2pQeVhTejJRcWd2WVZoczMxVlhMT01mdzh4U0t2cmdwVllzUklZNUFB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY – Utah public health officials announced the first case of measles to originate in the state in at least two years, urging those who may have come in contact with the person to watch closely for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a release, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services said it has "identified an adult from Utah County who has been diagnosed with measles." On Friday, Dr. Leisha Nolen, state epidemiologist, said the person is between 20 and 40 years old, she but did not identify the individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department said the person was unvaccinated "and has no out-of-state exposures, which indicates the infection was transmitted within Utah." The release stated that the department had identified anyone else with measles as of Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ksl-article-content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department said during thier "infectious period but prior to diagnosis," the person visited "several" public places. This included the Timpanogos Regional Emergency Room on June 14 between 2:14 p.m. and 7:02 p.m., and the Parkway Health Center in Orem on June 13, though no specific time was immediately known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nolen said the individual visited healthcare providers due to measles symptoms and was advised to stay home to quarantine, which they reportedly did following their diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People who were at these sites at the same time or two hours after this person could have been exposed to measles," the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials urged those who may have crossed paths with the infected Utah County resident, especially those who are unvaccinated, to watch for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do have to suspect there are additional measles cases in Utah," Nolen said, noting the affected individual had not traveled outside of the state, pointing to the disease originating from Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have not been able to identify how that happened, so certainly there is some person who was able to transmit the virus to this individual. So we do think there are additional cases," Nolen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Related:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Measles symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department said measles symptoms appear seven to 14 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People who have a high fever (higher than 102.2°F or 39°C) and a cough, runny nose or red eyes may have early stages of measles," the department said. "A rash will usually appear after four days of fever."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rash, usually showing up first at the hairline then spreading down a person's body, is described as one of the main identifying signs of measles, Nolen said in a press conference Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department noted that a person with measles can spread the disease before symptoms occur. Health officials urged those who develop symptoms to steer clear of others and call their health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Call first before you go to a clinic or hospital to prevent other people from exposure," the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the department, over "90% of Utahns have been vaccinated against measles and are highly protected against infection." The department noted that infants under 1 year old cannot get the vaccine, meaning they are not protected from measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nolen recommended people speak with their clinicians to track down what vaccines they've had and learn more about an option to get an antibody test that will show if antibodies are present. Nolen noted there is no danger in having additional doses of the vaccination. It is recommended that people get two doses of the vaccine to make sure they are fully protected, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Public health in Utah wants to reassure the community that immediate action is being taken to contain the situation," the department said. "We encourage those who are not vaccinated to talk to their doctor about receiving the vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nolen said in the press conference that the last case of measles in Utah occurred two years ago, "in an international traveler."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on measles, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story may be updated&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL News</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 20:12:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOM2oxcTFXUjhJZnNLR2xrUFVZUWhjci1vZ3o3WVI4SWZ0d2ptdnJiSWtVeGF4T0ZGUmVaNGVmR0d6SVp4NFRnaENOUzhyZk5kZWdtMmRTVjVDZllEclFjN1VhQTBXYW55Zjk0Q2Q1LWZDY2pQeVhTejJRcWd2WVZoczMxVlhMT01mdzh4U0t2cmdwVllzUklZNUFB</guid></item><item><title>犹他州报告了首例麻疹病例。以下是您需要了解的信息。-《盐湖论坛报》 | Utah reports its first measles case.

The person, who was not further identified, is unvaccinated and had no out-of-state exposures, indicating the infection was transmitted within Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-element"&gt;&lt;div class="image-rootCenter"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1ez1ofp"&gt;&lt;span class=" lazy-load-image-background "&gt;&lt;span class="image-img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption-credit"&gt;(Francisco Kjolseth  | The Salt Lake Tribune) Public health officials warn of the first verified case of measles in Utah as Dr. Leisha Nolen, state epidemiologist, gives an update on a adult from Utah County diagnosed with the highly contagious disease on Friday, June 20, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;At a press conference Friday, state epidemiologist Dr. Leisha Nolen said officials have not yet identified the source of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“We do think there are additional cases,” Nolen said. “At this time, we have not identified others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Nolen said the infected person is isolating at home with minimal contact. The Utah County Health Department has been working closely with the person and their family, she said, advising exposed relatives to monitor symptoms and stay home to prevent further spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Before their diagnosis, the Utah County resident visited several public places during their infectious period, health officials said. People who were at those sites during or two hours after that person may have been exposed to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Two of those locations were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt; • &lt;b&gt;The Parkway Health Center&lt;/b&gt;, 145 W. 1300 South, Orem, sometime on June 13. Health officials are trying to confirm a specific time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt; • &lt;b&gt;Timpanogos Regional ER&lt;/b&gt;, 750 W. 800 North, Orem, June 14, between 2:14 and 7:02 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;DHHS is urging people who were in those locations at those times to monitor themselves for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Measles symptoms typically appear seven to 14 days after exposure. They include a high fever — above 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit — and a cough, runny nose, or red eyes. A rash will usually appear within four days of a fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“The rash is really what hints to us that this is measles,” Nolen said, noting that it typically begins at the hairline and spreads down the body. “It can take up to three weeks from being exposed to actually start to have the symptoms, but usually it’s about 10 days.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;If you develop symptoms, stay away from other people and call your health care provider, health officials say. Call before going to a clinic or hospital, so staff there can prevent other people from exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;As of Thursday, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported&lt;/a&gt; a total of 1,214 confirmed measles cases in 34 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;In early June, &lt;a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/06/04/utah-officials-warn-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/06/04/utah-officials-warn-potential/"&gt;DHHS reported&lt;/a&gt; that an infected out-of-state person traveled through Utah’s Washington County, visiting family in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;According to DHHS, more than 90% of Utahns have been vaccinated against measles, and are well protected against infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, or MMR, Nolen said, “make you 97% sure that you will not get the infection. … And even if you do get the infection after that vaccine, it’s going to be much more mild than if you don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;There are exceptions, though: Infants younger than 1 year old, for example, are not eligible for the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Public health officials urge Utahns to check their immunization and medical records, or talk to a health care provider to see whether they were protected against measles. That’s especially true for people who are planning to travel outside the state or the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“It’s important to recognize that this is a controllable outbreak,” Nolen said, stressing the critical role of vaccination in reducing the risk of infection. “Unfortunately, measles does cause really severe disease, so one in 20 kids will go into the hospital, and that’s really significant. We also know kids can die of this. We’ve already had three deaths in the United States. We don’t want any more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Salt Lake Tribune</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 19:01:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE4tMlNCcVBwVzRJV0tIY3UxN3dIZDhFb0RBVnViUGd3THlzNnl2bkU2akJMLTRuX3V0cE1PdGoyUEFiVEloaTNTbEthaGhlSm9Td1RhWWNJZEtyWVU4WjVnSEx4RUJ4VUQ4SHNSN193RmpJMnFIdHlYdzhpbw</guid></item><item><title>美国宇航局代理局长珍妮特·佩特罗（ Janet Petro ） “拥抱挑战”更新2025年6月20日-美国宇航局观察 | Acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro ‘Embrace The Challenge’ Update June 20, 2025 - NASA Watch</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwgFBVV95cUxNOEN5SUNRUmxmUjRZLWJRSExETGJvODNZQUFZOGFNUGFlVG9HVHI3ZXBrcHBsekwxeFVRN0l1ZDVVcmV3VjhUazdsM0lMTXVYVHVzQkg3VTdkV2tJZU1vaVA2SkFFQTAxZ1I0NmstUUxtVV9KXzZFY2tmSF9DYVRkem5xQlV1ZUcwWFBwejFWMy1wTVl6MFJxZFg2dk5VUHpsbUE3R2hfY3RhM2lUNFV0OUR5MDRfajBsSnIwV1VlczRsUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wysiwyg"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keith’s note:&lt;/strong&gt; this weekly ‘Embrace The Challenge Update’ includes a link to a site where y ou can post questions for a 25 June agency wide town hall. It asks for name an email. So I used &lt;em&gt;Wehrner von Braun – &lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4e192b263c202b3c0e202f3d2f60292138"&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and I got in and posted &lt;em&gt;“So much for cybersecurity.”&lt;/em&gt; FYI the comment field says “&lt;em&gt;After submitting, your question will enter a moderation queue for approval&lt;/em&gt;” – In other words someone is going to filter the questions that Janet answers. Of course no one would ever think of censoring any of the questions that touch on certain topics. Just sayin’. &lt;strong&gt;Full memo below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-19971"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt; As we move through summer, I know many of you are balancing mission demands, upcoming transitions, and well-earned time off. I want to thank you for everything you’re doing to keep us steady – whether you’re supporting a mission milestone, planning for what’s ahead, or helping maintain continuity at your center.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, we have an agencywide town hall scheduled for 1 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, June 25. You should have received a calendar invite, and &lt;a href="https://nasa.cnf.io/sessions/anq4/before?session_before_redirect=http%3A//nasa.cnf.io/sessions/anq4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here’s the link to submit questions online&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Vanessa, Casey, Brian, and I know this is a challenging time, and we’re committed to having an open and honest conversation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ahead of that, I want to acknowledge the very real challenges many organizations are facing as we work through the potential for a more focused budget. These impacts vary across mission directorates, centers, and support offices, but no part of the agency is untouched. Some have asked why we’re acting now, or whether we should wait to see how Congress acts. The reality is we must make responsible choices based on the funding we are projected to receive and begin shaping the workforce toward the missions we’ve been called to do. Using voluntary tools like the Deferred Resignation Program, Voluntary Early Retirement Authority, and Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment now gives us the best chance to prepare for the next Fiscal Year without resorting to other more disruptive actions. These are NASA’s decisions, made in service of our mission, and our people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://nasawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/unnamed.png" alt="" class="wp-image-19972" srcset="https://nasawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/unnamed.png 770w, https://nasawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/unnamed-300x186.png 300w, https://nasawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/unnamed-768x477.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, a lot continues to happen across the agency:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More than 260 stakeholders from government, industry, and academia joined our Advanced Modeling &amp;amp; Simulation Seminar to learn about the Launch, Ascent, and Vehicle Aerodynamics (LAVA) framework as the team gears up for its public release this fall. The framework is a computational fluid dynamics software system that can accurately simulate challenging problems central to our mission, from aircraft performance evaluation to launch environment characterization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I signed a new agreement this week at the Paris Air Show with our longtime partners at the German Aerospace Center – DLR – that will extend our collaboration in space medicine research. As part of this effort, DLR will provide radiation sensors to fly aboard Orion during Artemis II, helping us better understand the health risks of deep space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week, Expedition 73 aboard space station centered efforts on exercise research, spacesuit readiness, and science operations – including studying fluid behavior in microgravity using containerless liquid systems – while NASA teams on the ground continue to review the recent repair to the Zvezda module’s aft segment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our TRACERS mission has reached an important milestone this week. The twin spacecraft – designed to study how solar wind interacts with Earth’s magnetosphere – arrived at Vandenberg Space Force Base. They will soon be integrated with a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket ahead of a planned July launch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On June 13, years of space technology investments to expand commercial launch capabilities culminated in the successful maiden flight of UP Aerospace’s Spyder hypersonic rocket. The new launch system offers a low-cost vehicle to enable enhanced suborbital missions and planetary re-entry test environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’d like to congratulate Rich Burns at Goddard and John Blevins at Marshall on being named 2025 Service to America Medal honorees – better known as the Sammies. Rich led the OSIRIS-REx mission, which successfully returned samples from asteroid Bennu and is helping us better understand the origins of our solar system. John, as chief engineer for SLS (Space Launch System) rocket, played a key role in the Artemis I mission and is helping us prepare for Artemis II. These awards recognize the highest levels of public service, and Rich and John’s work reflects the dedication and excellence that define our NASA team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Embrace the Challenge,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Janet&lt;/p&gt;

It has an average survival rate of 12 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man, who posted his story in an &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1lbdcel/i_have_six_months_to_live_ama/"&gt;anonymous Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt;, has just six months left to live despite living 'a very healthy lifestyle' and having no family history of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I never smoked, almost never drank, ate clean and exercised daily. Sometimes biology lets you down.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pancreatic cancer affects roughly 67,000 Americans every year and kills about 52,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than half the time, the disease is first spotted after it has already reached stage three or four due to its vague symptoms. These include abdominal pain, weight loss, back pain, jaundice and floating or clay-colored stools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This leads patients to assume their symptoms are from more benign causes like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was the case for Clair Honeywood, a 45-year-old from the UK who chocked her severe stomach pain up to IBS. She was diagnosed with inoperable pancreatic cancer and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14392951/deadly-pancreatic-cancer-warning-signs-stomach-pain-IBS.html"&gt;given a year to live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Matthew Rosenblum of Michigan assumed his &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13301841/diagnosed-lethal-pancreatic-cancer-miracle-drug-combo.html"&gt;bone-white stools&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 were from Crohn's disease, but it was actually stage four pancreatic cancer at age 32. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear exactly what causes pancreatic cancer, but smoking, obesity and diabetes are thought to increase the risk by inducing harmful inflammation that causes cells to divide and become mutated more easily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man in the Reddit thread, however, blames his diagnosis on bad luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'Before this diagnosis, I was in perfect health. I thought I had another 50 years left. The first thought was “This is too soon.”'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The former engineer said he will soon move into hospice care and try psilocybin therapy for pain and the mental health effects that have come with his diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Psilocybin, the psychoactive ingredient in magic mushrooms, has been thought to reduce anxiety and depression in cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also has signed up for several clinical trials. It's unclear if he will be getting standard treatments like chemotherapy or radiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Clair Honeywood (left), 45, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at stage three after mistaking her symptoms for IBS. Matthew Rosenblum, meanwhile, thought his bone-white stools were from Crohn's disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Early signs of pancreatic cancer include jaundice, stomach pain, back pain, weight loss, and floating stools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For now, he is focusing on using up his savings on vacations, scuba diving, skydiving and other items on his bucket list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His main regret is not taking enough risks like 'starting a business, moving to another place, trying something you were interested in but didn't know if you could do.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In the end, your failures are often not as consequential as you might think,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I’m glad I’ve been able to experience life. In all the possible realities I could’ve existed in, this was a pretty good one. Even if it’s short. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don’t have any grandiose aspirations for my legacy. A simple “that guy was alright” is good enough for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The biggest piece of advice I would give is to not take the time you have for granted. I know that’s probably a worn out statement, but it rings incredibly true when you realize how finite your life really is.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 18:14:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxPYjFjZHUzOHNGbG00bU9CUFBvXzdZemFYaVdRWnE0NEhXSndyeXFZcG42ZjVrZnQxOGN6cWRWcXhnR0ZXdV9TVFFndTA1NTBmckVqVndWalQzUEx4Qi1oZm54NEx0V1lETE1oQmNTdXFUY3RabllvM0Q4UjFyWFRwbTV0WjI3U3BLeGc2WExFb3hnUVRzQkFkWG0zZ1laVXJpSUNFbmxhYWFqQ0VEbC0xTDZR0gG3AUFVX3lxTE43RGp2R1RzTkFpS1RGWjd0eV9CVTFLazlvVkN3dlhfQ2NuOEdFQk1WNm5heUJKRENCczNTekJfTUxVU3VUOGhTR0VaeVVvS18zdG1jaERfOG1MeDdsMkYwX0NtMThUc2dUcUNzRzNzMXI3SnM0ZWlBYzROenl1VThrZ1J4RFg0VlBNVWtWcXk5cHJ0UmlsQTBMTGZhajlPeEVHeDJsS3JOUHkxaUR2d2tMZlowZ3l4aw</guid></item><item><title>男性在获得捐赠肾脏后健康崩溃-它充斥着蠕虫- Ars Technica | Man’s health crashes after getting donated kidney—it was riddled with worms - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxQVVdxSjBodGJCeThZSC1XTEpMLVh0Ny1rOExDam90WXhqVWgwbzd2VF9xY24zdzZBZWRoZHJIMWpLRFdVdHRpRkh3cGZkeWotc0V4WEVNTHhEQ0R4b2RXRHotU3F0alNBTkxOc1VhNy1tN2QyUWl6S3luRlZrc3lWSmVSczNfazA0TmlqX051MmdfRHFxWFVoYTFYeVNnUDVNa2J3aWlaeU9sbDNqWlpMYmdqOWw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;About two months after receiving a donated kidney, a 61-year-old man ended up back in the hospital. He was tired, nauseous, and vomiting. He was also excessively thirsty and producing too much urine. Over the next 10 days, things only got worse. The oxygen levels in his blood began to fall. His lungs filled with fluid. He kept vomiting. He couldn't eat. Doctors inserted a feeding tube. His oxygen levels and blood pressure kept falling. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and put on mechanical ventilation. Still, things kept getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, he was transferred to the ICU of Massachusetts General Hospital, where he had received the transplant. He was in acute respiratory failure and shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412510"&gt;a case report in this week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, doctors at Mass General explained how they determined what was wrong with the man. Their first steps were collecting more information about the man's symptoms from his wife, reviewing his family medical history, and contacting the regional organ-procurement organization that provided the kidney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Process of elimination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man's condition and laboratory tests suggested he had some sort of infection. But as a transplant recipient who was on a variety of immunosuppressive drugs, the list of infectious possibilities was "extensive."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Camille Kotton, Clinical Director of the hospital's Transplant and Immunocompromised Host Infectious Diseases division, laid out her thinking. She started with a process of elimination. As an immunosuppressed transplant patient, he was also on several medications to proactively prevent infections. These would rule out herpesviruses and cytomegalovirus. He was also on a combination of antibiotics that would rule out many bacterial infections, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482370/"&gt;fungal infection &lt;em&gt;Pneumocystis jirovecii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that strikes the immunocompromised and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563286/"&gt;the protozoan parasite &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One feature stood out: The man had developed elevated levels of eosinophils, white blood cells that can increase for various reasons—including parasitic infections. The man also had a reddish-purple rash over his abdomen. Coupled with the severity of his illness, Kotton suspected a widespread parasitic infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man's history was notable for contact with domestic cats and dogs—including a cat scratch in the time between having the transplant and falling critically ill. But common bacterial infections linked to cat scratches could be ruled out. And other parasitic infections that might come from domestic animals in the US, such as toxocariasis, don't typically lead to such critical illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

She was given six months to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a decade later she is living a full and vibrant life - defying the odds in what doctors call a 'miracle' case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2015, she began experiencing headaches and seizures, prompting her to go to the hospital. Doctors found &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14408499/unusual-sign-cancer-decade-glioblastoma-brain-symptom.html"&gt;a tumor in her brainstem&lt;/a&gt;, called a glioma, a typically fatal &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-03d25b20-4df1-11f0-890e-2ff2c2bfa2b3"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; with minimal treatment options that are often unsuccessful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors said she had about six months to live until the cancer, which has a survival rate of about eight percent, killed her.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wethor said: ‘Because my tumor is so difficult to treat, I was able to leave the hospital and spend my "last six months" doing what I love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘During those first six months, when I thought they might be my last, I made it a mission to do something creative every single day.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She painted, taught herself how to play guitar, and made fashion a form of self-expression. She visited museums with her mother, which she said 'was crucial to keeping my mind off my diagnosis and current health circumstances.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she never received treatment, her symptoms – &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14808807/brain-cancer-perimenopause-symptom-sign.html"&gt;headaches, fatigue, and seizures&lt;/a&gt; – became manageable with a healthy balance of mindfulness and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Ten years ago, doctors discovered a tumor in her brainstem—a usually fatal cancer. Yet Wethor has beaten the odds, living a vibrant life full of adventure and creativity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s not always perfect, but I’ve found ways to work with my body rather than against it,’ she said. ‘Most days, I’m able to live a full and relatively normal life…I don’t assume I have time.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, an advocate for cancer research, Wethor undergoes MRI scans, fearing all the time that the cancer has grown. But she hasn't let that fear take over her life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A glioma of the brain stem is a tumor that develops in the area connecting the brain to the spinal cord and can come in different varieties based on the specific type of glial cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The brainstem is crucial in controlling vital functions such as breathing, heart rate, swallowing, and movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Damage to it can lead to a wide range of devastating effects that Wethor fears are lurking just around the corner, including difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brainstem gliomas are rare and more common in children than adults. Every year, there are roughly 300 cases in adults and 500 cases in children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is the same cancer President Joe Biden's son Beau had. He was diagnosed in 2013 and died two years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My doctors can’t explain why I have survived,’ she said. ‘I still have my tumor, but miraculously, it has not grown.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no treatment for this form of cancer, leaving her wondering when her regular MRI scan will show that the tumor has grown and pressure on her brain has worsened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors do not know what prompted the tumor to develop, how it might respond to treatment, what the best available treatments are, or whether it will come back if a patient reaches remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Grace Wethor in 2020. While not in treatment, her symptoms – headaches, fatigue, and seizures – are manageable with a healthy balance of mindfulness and physical health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;‘The hope is that one day a trial or new treatment will emerge that can help tumors in this area of the brain,’ she said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But research suggests that a simple measure you can do at home is highly predictive of longevity. It’s known as your grip strength, and it measures the force or pressure your hand exerts when squeezing or holding an object. Grip strength can be measured in a doctor’s office, or you can pick up a device called a hand grip dynamometer (like this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Handeful-Dynamometer-Measurement-Electronic-Strengthener/dp/B08X4JQDJZ/ref=sr_1_5?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.65125207%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;) to check it at home on your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://mdmercy.com/find-a-doctor/clayton-alexander-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clayton Alexander, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clayton Alexander, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, orthopedic surgeon and hand specialist at Mercy Medical Center; &lt;a href="https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/alfred-tallia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alfred F.

But doctors say there is something to grip strength and indicating a healthy, long life. Here’s what the study found, plus what doctors want you to keep in mind when using this as a measurement of your health status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38595265/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed data from more than 12,000 adults aged 50 and older for 12 years. The researchers used handgrip dynamometry measurements to track grip strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that people with weaker grip strengths had a 45% higher risk of dying during the study period than those with stronger grips. The researchers concluded that grip strength provides a “robust prediction of time to mortality” and suggests that healthcare providers encourage people to do strength training as they get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Muscle health is part of overall health, and longevity is a significant health outcome,” says &lt;a href="https://www.ndsu.edu/hnes/faculty_and_staff/ryan_mcgrath/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ryan McGrath., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ryan McGrath., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, lead study author and associate professor in the department of Health, Nutrition, and Exercise Sciences at North Dakota State University. “Understanding how aspects of muscle health, such as strength, may connect with health outcomes is important for informing relevant programs and lifespan health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How might grip strength be linked to longevity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a new concept, and, in fact, doctors usually test grip strength during check-ups as people get older or if they’re getting ready for surgery. “It’s part of the measure of frailty,” says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/199050-david-m-cutler" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Cutler, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;David Cutler, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. “We use frailty as a measurement all the time to assess someone’s risk for surgery and health status.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grip strength has emerged as an indicator of total body muscle mass and strength, explains &lt;a href="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=ns1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nikhil Satchidanand, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nikhil Satchidanand, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, exercise physiologist and assistant professor in the University at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Division of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine. “It is not just a measure of muscle power but also helps us understand the general health of our skeletal muscles,” he says. “In clinical and research settings, grip strength is used as a non-invasive, easy, and cost-effective way to gather information about an individual’s overall health and function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good grip strength is also crucial for survival, points out &lt;a href="https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/alfred-tallia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alfred F. Tallia, M.D., M.P.H.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alfred F. Tallia, M.D., M.P.H.&lt;/a&gt;, professor and chair of family medicine and community health at the Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. “The ability to grasp things is an essential part of our daily lives that touches our success at all activities of daily living—feeding, bathing, clothing ourselves, ambulating, and movement,” he says. “So it is not at all surprising that a decline in grip strength is correlated with prediction of impending death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips for improving grip strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all of that, grip strength isn’t the end-all, be-all for longevity. In fact, Dr. Cutler points out that it’s “just one of several measures” doctors use to look at a person’s health status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know that it’s the grip strength that leads to a longer life, and we don’t know if it will improve their longevity, but we can use measurements that include both grip strength and other standard frailty measurements,” Dr. Cutler says. (Those include things like whether someone has multiple underlying health conditions and if they’ve lost significant weight lately with no explanation, he says.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you want to improve your grip strength, there are things you can do. “You can improve grip strength by using a grip strength trainer, but just because you do so does not mean you can reduce mortality,” Dr. Alexander says. (It just may mean that you’ll be better at opening jars or grasping weights.) You can also try repeatedly squeezing a ball, McGrath says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But experts stress that your grip strength can only tell so much about how long you’ll live. “Grip strength loss is just a marker of frailty—it is not the cause of mortality,” Dr. Alexander says. If you’re concerned that your grip isn’t strong, McGrath says you can work on it. But you’re worried about your overall health, he recommends focusing on physical activity and eating a healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 16:18:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE9kTHdnYjExMnJBWURxeTN2WWl0NGlxOENpMVZGRVZQMlcwaDhVcURCNjZ6RHY1R3EyTFJkWWYxZjJ6SGg0NTNRN28zVHhBdUZXdHFhdFNQajcyQmFjX1JUMWRkeUM2QlZtbkN2N3FB</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，排名第一的低估食物可以增加您的镁摄入量- EatingWell | The #1 Underrated Food to Increase Your Magnesium Intake, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxNcnhiRE16VFBFbm45ZjhwLWZXY252SW55Q2tmRmNIb1VyU0xTMnRxTFJGZFJPTGE1c1JRcS1LbkFYdm1MM21Mb09pbEZfS1hvRmItVUpTWHQyX0IwbEhKd0hJOFFBcHJoQXh6MWE1bVpFazlwVGRfTGFZYU1QVkNiMWV2eDVUWEctTUQyZDJnZVhlVVBqR0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adequate magnesium intake supports a healthy heart, better sleep and good digestion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chia seeds are an excellent source of magnesium. They also offer fiber, protein and omega-3 fatty acids. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can enjoy chia seeds in so many ways, including overnight oats, chia pudding and jam.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium doesn’t receive as much airtime as other nutrients (like protein), yet it’s so important for maintaining our whole-body health. The mineral helps with heart and nerve function, blood pressure, blood sugar regulation, strong bones and energy production. “Magnesium is a mineral your body needs to help over 300 little ‘helper’ proteins (called enzymes) do their jobs,” says &lt;a href="https://inutritioncenter.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Vanessa Imus, RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When magnesium levels are low, your first symptoms may include muscle cramps, fatigue or poor sleep, says Imus.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re not eating enough &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-metabolic-syndrome-11736662" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;, such as leafy greens, nuts, seeds and whole grains, you’re probably low in this mineral. Let’s zero in on seeds as a source of magnesium: Dietitians say &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dangers-of-chia-seeds-11717491" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt;, specifically, are a simple, underrated way to add more magnesium to your day.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One ounce (about 2 tablespoons) of chia seeds offers 95 milligrams of magnesium, which provides 23% of your Daily Value.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That same 1-ounce serving has &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7959854/ways-to-add-5-grams-of-fiber-to-your-meals/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;10 grams of fiber&lt;/a&gt; (!), 5 grams of the omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid and 5 grams of protein. Chia seeds also offer B vitamins and are a source of a number of antioxidants, including chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, kaempferol and quercetin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds provide magnesium and fiber, both of which are essential for maintaining a healthy digestive system. For starters, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-8656021" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium may help promote&lt;/a&gt; the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut.  These bacteria work to improve the gut barrier’s function and balance the microbiome, Imus says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Not only that, but magnesium may also help regulate bowel movements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Two tablespoons of chia seeds pack an impressive 35% of your fiber needs. Eating more fiber helps with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-before-in-the-morning-to-help-you-poop-11718405" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;digestion regularity&lt;/a&gt; so that you’re going to the bathroom consistently (and easily)—just make sure to drink plenty of water.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The ample amount of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/signs-youre-not-getting-enough-magnesium-11740104" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, fiber and omega-3 fats found in chia seeds also supports a healthy heart. Chia seeds may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lower-triglycerides-mistakes-11742759" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lowering triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;, while also raising HDL cholesterol.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds, especially ground chia seeds, can increase levels of omega-3 fatty acids in the blood, which can help fight heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In turn, low magnesium levels have been linked to issues like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7906963/sneaky-reasons-blood-pressure-is-high-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and irregular heartbeat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re not sleeping well, it could be a sign your body needs more magnesium, says &lt;a href="https://sproutoutloud.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ali McGowan, M.S., RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;: “Chia seeds are a small, easy step to help fill that gap.” Observational studies have found that low magnesium intake may be linked to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8076313/magnesium-for-sleep/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sleep problems&lt;/a&gt; like snoring, short sleep duration and daytime sleepiness.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, emerging research has found that omega-3 fatty acids may also improve how well you sleep.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds have a slight earthy taste, but otherwise, they don’t have much flavor. This means chia seeds can easily be added to many dishes and recipes to add thickness while also boosting the nutritional offerings. “I love adding chia seeds to overnight oats, blending them into smoothies for extra thickness, or making a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cinnamon-roll-oatmeal-8690614" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;quick pudding with milk, cinnamon and vanilla&lt;/a&gt;,” says McGowan.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add to oats: &lt;/strong&gt;Add fun texture and thickness to your overnight oats recipe. You can add chia seeds ground or whole, just make sure to add more liquid for the seeds to soak up, or else your breakfast may be dry. The &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-high-protein-high-fiber-meal-plan-for-weight-loss-11736989" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber and protein combo&lt;/a&gt; from chia seeds will give you more staying power (i.e., you’ll feel fuller longer) throughout the morning.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make chia pudding: &lt;/strong&gt;Chia pudding couldn’t be easier to pull together. Just combine chia seeds with your choice of liquid (milk and plant-based milks work well) and voilà, chia pudding. Adding flavors like vanilla, ground cinnamon, honey or maple syrup will take your pudding up a notch. Or try our go-to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Chia Seed Pudding&lt;/a&gt; recipe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create your own jam: &lt;/strong&gt;Store-bought jam can be high in added sugar and low in nutrients, so consider making your own with chia seeds. It’s as simple as combining a fruit of your choice—frozen berries work well—with chia seeds.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Imus also reminds us not to overdo it. ​​“Chia seeds absorb a lot of water, and too much may lead to constipation or bloating.” Starting with 1 to 2 tablespoons is a reasonable amount.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds make for a great way to up your intake of magnesium. Two tablespoons of chia seeds provide about a quarter of our daily needs, which helps support a healthy heart, better sleep and good digestion. Try adding the seeds to overnight oats, smoothies, yogurt or toast for a boost in not only magnesium, but also omega-3 fatty acids, fiber and protein.

&lt;p&gt;Some oral bacteria and related virulence factors, such as molecules that help bacteria colonize the body — many of which can trigger a potent inflammatory response — were significantly enriched in the guts of Parkinson’s patients with cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that promoting a healthy microbiome through consistent oral care, a balanced diet, and potentially targeted probiotic interventions could support improved disease management in Parkinson’s,” Saeed Shoaie, PhD, the study’s lead at King’s College London in the U.K., said in a &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/mouth-and-gut-bacteria-linked-to-brain-changes-in-parkinsons-disease"&gt;university news story&lt;/a&gt;. The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2025.2506843#abstract"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Microbiome signatures of virulence in the oral-gut-brain axis influence Parkinson’s disease and cognitive decline pathophysiology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Gut Microbes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with Parkinson’s can have a range of &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/non-motor/"&gt;nonmotor symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, including gastrointestinal problems such as constipation or nausea, in the years before &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt; appear. Changes in the gut may play a role in Parkinson’s development via the communication system between the gut and the brain, called the gut-brain axis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the oral health of Parkinson’s patients also impacts the course of their disease, the contribution of mouth bacteria has been largely overlooked. In fact, &lt;em&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;, a well-studied oral bacterium, has been found in the brain of people with &lt;a href="https://alzheimersnewstoday.com/approved-treatments-for-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, and active gum disease, or periodontitis, has been reported to impact cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The human gut and oral bacterial communities are increasingly linked to neurodegenerative diseases,” Shoaie said. “Disruptions in the gut-brain axis could trigger inflammation and immune responses that contribute to neuronal damage.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Gut, oral microbiome effect on cognition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined gut and mouth bacteria collected from the stool and saliva samples of Parkinson’s patients with mild cognitive decline and dementia to explore the role of gut and oral microbiomes on cognitive impairment. A group of healthy people served as controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s patients with dementia had significantly less gut microbiome diversity than those with mild cognitive impairment. There was also a decrease in microbial diversity and the metagenomic species richness, or the total number of different species within a microbial community, in the oral microbiome of those with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a species analysis, there was a limited number of overlapping bacterial species across all three groups, meaning many species were uniquely enriched or depleted in patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. This suggests “these microbial changes are likely associated with [cognitive impairment],” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a predictive assessment, the changes in microbial species were sensitive enough to differentiate between Parkinson’s patients with varying clinical features, and adding data like age and sex significantly improved the predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We don’t yet know if the bacteria are causing the cognitive decline or if changes in the body due to Parkinson’s allow these bacteria to grow,” said Frederick Clasen, PhD, the study’s first author and research associate at King’s College London. “But our findings suggest they may play an active role in worsening symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When oral bacteria move to the gut&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers then investigated so-called oral-gut translocation, wherein oral bacteria move into the gut, where they don’t usually live. Data showed the guts of patients with dementia were significantly enriched with mouth bacteria. Moreover, those with cognitive impairment or dementia had significantly higher levels of oral-specific virulence factors in the gut, that is, molecules that help the bacterium colonize the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identified virulence factors had various functions, including stress, immune modulation, adherence, biofilm formation, invasion, and metabolism. Some are important for bacteria to infect cells that line the blood vessels in the brain. At the same time, several other factors related to immune modulation were involved in producing LPS, a molecule on bacterial surfaces that triggers inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These toxins could be used as biological markers to identify patients at higher risk of dementia in Parkinson’s,” Clasen said. “In the future, they might also be targets for new treatments that protect the brain by changing the gut environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers also saw a drop in several types of bacteria in the mouth of patients with dementia or cognitive impairment compared with healthy people, which could suggest a loss of healthy bacterial balance, making it easier for harmful bacteria to take over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our study provides compelling evidence that the interplay between oral and gut microbiomes significantly influences [Parkinson’s] and [cognitive impairment],” the researcher wrote. “The translocation of oral microbial species to the gut, along with their associated [virulence factors], highlights new avenues for understanding disease mechanisms and developing potential biomarkers and therapeutic avenues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoaie said the “emerging evidence underscores the potential importance of maintaining oral and gut health in mitigating or slowing neurodegenerative processes. As people with Parkinson’s become increasingly reliant on carers, routine practices such as oral hygiene and nutritional intake may be neglected.”&lt;/p&gt;

The energy they produce is critical in the brain as this organ consumes roughly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8364152/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;20 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the body’s resting energy budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, no one had measured how these organelles are arranged across the brain in three dimensions, which left a gap between the knowledge of cellular biology and the understanding of mental feats that rise or fall with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-energy-from-brain-mitochondria-matters"&gt;Why energy from brain mitochondria matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biology of the brain, we know now, is deeply intertwined with the energetics of the brain,” said &lt;a href="https://www.columbia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; psychobiologist &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/profile/martin-picard-phd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Martin Picard&lt;/a&gt;, a co‑author of the new work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picard and an international team built the &lt;a href="http://humanmitobrainmap.bcblab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MitoBrainMap&lt;/a&gt; from 703 match‑head‑sized samples taken from the donated brain of a 54‑year‑old man who died of a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists profiled &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553192/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;oxidative phosphorylation&lt;/a&gt; capacity, mitochondrial DNA copies, and organelle volume in every cube, then trained a model that predicts energy traits for the rest of the brain with MRI‑level resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cutting-the-brain-into-cubes"&gt;Cutting the brain into cubes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each 0.12‑inch (3 millimeter) cube matched the smallest unit a hospital scanner can currently resolve, thereby bridging lab assays with clinical images. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Handling nearly seven hundred samples demanded robotic slicing, automated biochemistry, and hefty computing power, yet the approach preserved regional context that test‑tube studies lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once trained, the model reconstructed a whole‑&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-brains-use-storage-trick-to-keep-your-memories-in-sequential-order/"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; atlas that can overlay standard neuroimages, letting clinicians see where energy shortfalls align with symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-old-brain-regions-had-fewest-mitochondria"&gt;Old brain regions had fewest mitochondria &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evolutionarily ancient areas such as the brainstem and basal ganglia showed the sparsest mitochondrial coverage, indicating the lowest production of energy for brain cells. More recently evolved cortical folds, in comparison, brimmed with high‑output organelles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;German neuroscientist &lt;a href="https://valentinriedl.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Valentin Riedl&lt;/a&gt;, who was not involved in the project, called the feat “technically impressive and conceptually groundbreaking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gradient matches behavioral observations: functions like balance and breathing endure late into life, whereas problem‑solving and working memory (tasks seated in newer cortical regions) fade first when energy falters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-evolutionary-changes-in-brain-mitochondria-functions"&gt;Evolutionary changes in brain mitochondria functions &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings align with evolutionary &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7617105/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;theories&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that more recently developed brain regions evolved to support complex tasks like language, planning, and abstract thinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-brain-is-constantly-making-predictions-about-the-world-and-your-place-in-reality/"&gt;functions &lt;/a&gt;require more energy, which explains why newer cortical areas are packed with higher-density and more efficient mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, older brain structures responsible for survival functions like breathing or heart rate regulation operate on lower energy demands. This evolutionary layering may help explain why certain cognitive abilities are more vulnerable to aging and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lessons-from-gray-and-white-matter"&gt;Lessons from gray and white matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553239/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gray matter&lt;/a&gt; in the brain packed about fifty percent more mitochondria than &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf3736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;white matter&lt;/a&gt;, and those mitochondria also generated energy with greater efficiency. That finding echoes earlier &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11024075/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; showing that the density of mitochondrial complex I correlates with IQ and processing speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because gray matter handles local computation while white matter relays long‑range signals, the split hints that thinking depends not just on how many mitochondria exist but also on how well they convert fuel into &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31985968/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ATP&lt;/a&gt;, the cell’s energy currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-linking-energy-to-mental-performance"&gt;Linking energy to mental performance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10526226/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that mitochondrial health strongly influences learning, attention, and emotional regulation. These traits rely on fast, flexible neural circuits that are especially sensitive to energy shortfalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regions like the prefrontal cortex, essential for decision-making and working memory, demand high levels of ATP to function properly. When mitochondria falter in these areas, even minor deficits can ripple outward into daily thinking and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signals-for-aging-brains"&gt;Signals for aging brains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dysfunction of brain mitochondria is increasingly viewed as a driver of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39877373/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;neurodegenerative disorders&lt;/a&gt;; recent reviews tie impaired organelle dynamics to amyloid and tau build‑up in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2317673121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; from Picard’s lab links psychosocial stress to shifts in the biology of brain mitochondria, suggesting lifestyle and environment may tweak the energetic landscape long before plaques appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By pinpointing where energy production runs thin, the new map could steer drug and behavioral trials toward the regions most likely to benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-toward-personalized-energy-profiles"&gt;Toward personalized energy profiles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early data hint that individual lifestyles (diet, sleep patterns, exercise) may leave distinct marks on each person’s brain energy map. Tracking those differences could guide tailored interventions long before clinical symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining the MitoBrainMap with wearable health trackers may reveal how daily habits shift brain mitochondrial performance in real time. That fusion of lab-grade &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-mapping-research-mouse-neurons-revolutionary-advance/"&gt;precision&lt;/a&gt; and personal monitoring opens the door to truly preventive brain care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team has already begun cataloging nine key regions in 500 additional brains to gauge variation across sex, ancestry, and disease history. If the patterns hold, future MRI scans may include an energy overlay that predicts who is at risk for memory lapses, years before they first arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08740-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 15:07:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPTFV3aVRaUTJxcTFjY3lsS01tdlY3UERBak05X0J0NUhiRnVWNHF3Tk1LQTc5ZG9ESGpOeE90VUVhYUlzenF6ZFdINVhBTFRhM011cjBFaVhyOVFRZnViUDVQRVVFdV95Ym1JWUd5ZmcwMmg1VE91LXNuRmpTN1Rnenp3RzdzdV9taW4waXF0cFJ3N2dnZUhOMUd3</guid></item><item><title>医生如何为RFK Jr.的疫苗政策转变做准备-第19期新闻 | How doctors are preparing for RFK Jr.’s shifts on vaccine policy - The 19th News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE1jbjI5V0NDZldwOTlJQVlraEhaLUxMU3hMU050Z2M5cVdxZ2FGTDhDeERJdEo1ZE8tcG1rNlp2RnpvTmpmYUIwcXM2ZWl5cVI2c2xQeWliTDE1cWlnUnR4c3ZVZ1VmcFpPZ3c0Qjk0NlphRkhzSUY4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenberg article-body-width js-hang-punc"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        
                  
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to vaccines, there are two kinds of parents coming into Dr. Megan Prior’s office in Washington, D.C., these days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One set are parents who pepper the pediatrician with increasingly panicked questions about the future availability of vaccines and whether their children can get any shots early. Then there are the parents who feel vindicated in their decision not to vaccinate their kids, &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Weighing-the-Risks-and-Benefits.aspx"&gt;despite vaccines’ overall safety and record of disease prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s almost like I have these two groups of diverging patients, where some are really, really worried about their access and want to get things done as soon as possible,” she said. “And then others are sort of in this vaccine hesitant category.”&lt;/p&gt;

  

  
      
  




&lt;p&gt;Both groups have been spurred by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s HHS shakeups could have huge implications for vaccine policy in America. Earlier this month, he fired all 17 members of a key vaccine panel and replaced them with a smaller group of people who in some cases &lt;a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/06/rfk-jr-fires-vaccine-panel-replacements/"&gt;lack relevant experience and who, like him, have been skeptical of vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/rfk-jr-hhs-moves-to-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines-45495112"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; the vaccine panel firings were aimed at addressing members’ conflicts of interest, even though they worked under &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/ACIP-conflicts-interest-policy.pdf"&gt;a comprehensive policy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Physicians who treat both children and families say they’re frustrated with Kennedy’s unprecedented firing of the panel known as the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) — and they’re concerned about what it might mean for the future availability of safe and effective vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, doctors are figuring out as a medical community how they can keep their patients healthy with evidence-based guidelines. They’re turning to each other — through membership in trusted organizations that are taking joint actions — and figuring out how to give patients reliable information amid uncertainty about the government’s next steps.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ACIP’s review of vaccines and subsequent guidance, under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, helps insurance companies determine vaccine coverage. A change to ACIP recommendations could have the ripple effect of making a vaccine more expensive to obtain, or more difficult to access through doctors’ offices and pharmacies. The new panel has not taken any actions yet, but its members are scheduled to next week. Vaccine experts say they’re watching closely to see what policy changes, if any, might emerge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If I were a mom, and I’m thinking, ‘What do I do for my kid right now?’ I want to be confident that my primary care physician, my family doctor or my pediatrician was making recommendations based on what we know from science and not based on what the insurance company will or will not pay for, or what politics is saying,” said Dr. Jen Brull, a longtime family physician who is now president of &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/home.html"&gt;the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)&lt;/a&gt;. “I think it’s very safe to say that you can look to your primary care physician for that kind of recommendation, and that’s what you should be looking for.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prior, who has long used ACIP and CDC guidance on vaccines to answer questions from parents, said she recently downloaded a version of the current children’s vaccination schedule that includes recommendations made by the fired vaccine panel, “just in case there are any changes, so I can remember exactly how wording looked.” She is creating a list of trusted sources, including &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKC2kT9HsmA"&gt;the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)&lt;/a&gt; and AAFP, so she can monitor how they mirror or pivot from future government actions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other vaccine experts have announced their &lt;a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/cidrap-launches-vaccine-integrity-project"&gt;own initiative&lt;/a&gt; to protect the integrity of vaccine policy, information and access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Clearly, there’s a lot of us who are super interested in evidence-based science that will ensure that physicians and families have access to the right recommendations, no matter how politicized things get,” Prior said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Around the same time that news about Kennedy’s ACIP firings broke, hundreds of doctors were gathered in Chicago for a key meeting of &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/"&gt;the American Medical Association (AMA)&lt;/a&gt;, the largest association of physicians, representing more than 190 state and specialty medical societies. Within hours after the firings were public, Brull and representatives from several major medical groups drafted an &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/a25-emergency-1001.pdf"&gt;emergency resolution&lt;/a&gt; that called on Kennedy to reverse his actions on the vaccine panel and also requested a Senate investigation into the firings. The resolution passed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The emotion in the room was that everyone who was there cared about this — but we wanted to make sure that the AMA, that our individual organizations, were speaking truth,” Brull said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. David Higgins, a pediatrician and spokesperson for AAP, said the recent dismantling of expertise on ACIP threatens a clarity that has developed over decades within the medical community when it comes to vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AAP has been issuing vaccine guidance since 1935, nearly three decades before ACIP was created. To help reduce confusion, both entities officially began publishing harmonized guidance on vaccines in 1995. The consistency helped streamline care for families and reduced discrepancies as combination vaccines became more widely available, according to Higgins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AAP still maintains its own expert review process for its vaccine schedule, and Higgins said the organization plans to keep issuing recommendations that are “grounded in science and committed to child health.” He worries about potentially conflicting recommendations in the future, and how that might raise public confusion and distrust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Parents we talk with are understandably anxious and unsure,” he said in an email. “Our parents and families have a lot of questions, and as pediatricians, we welcome those questions. Pediatricians want to partner with parents and meet them where they are with compassion, clarity, and credible information.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brull also wanted to emphasize that point from the lens of family physicians, who sometimes see generations of one family and can be a key source of evidence-based medical information, especially in rural areas with more limited health coverage options.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My foundational advice to parents and kids who are old enough to have these conversations on their own is that the best thing most people can do is reach out and talk to their primary care doctor — whether that’s their pediatrician or their family physician, and have a conversation,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prior, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/ittybittyrevolution/reels/"&gt;who shares her views on health policy news on social media&lt;/a&gt;, does not want to minimize the implications of ACIP’s new membership and what it could mean if they pull a safe vaccine from the immunization schedules for adults or children. She still distinctly remembers her constant worry about whether her young child could access a COVID-19 vaccine, and the transition to in-person schooling and re-entering more public spaces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If we live in a world where &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/"&gt;measles is incredibly common&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/national-international/whooping-cough-pertussis-post-pandemic-pediatrician-vaccination/3759327/"&gt;whooping cough is incredibly common&lt;/a&gt;, where these really infectious diseases are just part of our lives again, parents will have to go through those decisions again,” she said. “I think that piece of it makes me so frustrated. I know how frustrating it was to be a parent in COVID, and I do not wish that stress on anyone. It’s doubly frustrating that this stress we would be putting on ourselves is 100 percent preventable.”&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Vaping might be safer than cigarette smoking, but they carry their own health risks. A New Jersey man’s electronic cigarette habit likely contributed to his fast-spreading, fatal lung cancer, his doctors say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors at the AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center in Atlantic City &lt;a href="https://amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/947911"&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; the tragic death this month in the American Journal of Case Reports. The 51-year-old former smoker and longtime vaper developed an aggressive lung cancer that killed him just months after diagnosis. Though a causative link isn’t confirmed, the authors say more studies are needed to figure out vaping’s cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the man visited a local hospital sometime in 2020 after he started to cough up blood. During the prior month, he had also been experiencing symptoms of weight loss, chest discomfort, and shortness of breath. Tests soon revealed that he had a form of non-small cell lung carcinoma, specifically determined to be squamous cell carcinoma. The cancer had already started to spread and break off into pieces that reached the heart, making surgery unfeasible. He was discharged and quickly placed on chemotherapy, but to no avail. The man’s health continued to rapidly deteriorate and he died three months after his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The man had a history of cigarette smoking, the equivalent of 10 pack-years (meaning he smoked roughly a pack a day for 10 years). But he told the doctors he quit in 2009 and switched exclusively to e-cigarettes for the next 11 years. He regularly received lung and heart check-ups, and his last chest X-ray two years earlier was normal, suggesting his cancer only recently emerged. Because of the aggressive and non-responsive nature of the cancer, his relatively young age (most cases are caught in people over 65) and the lack of recent cigarette use, the doctors suspect that vaping probably played a part in his death.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“While causality cannot be established, the case highlights a potential association between [vaping] and malignancy,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People have gotten seriously sick from vaping before, though usually under specific circumstances. In 2019, for instance, a mysterious lung disease that affected thousands of people in the U.S. was ultimately &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/what-ever-happened-to-the-vaping-lung-disease-1845750495"&gt;traced back&lt;/a&gt; to toxic additives primarily used in THC-containing vapes (while the initial outbreak did subside, these cases still &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/woman-hospitalized-with-covid-19-was-actually-suffering-1847362336"&gt;appear&lt;/a&gt; occasionally). Other chemicals used to flavor vapes have also &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/popcorn-lung-how-vaping-could-scar-your-lungs-for-life/"&gt;been tied&lt;/a&gt; to rare lung illnesses. But this appears to be one of the first case reports to explicitly link vaping and lung cancer. Other &lt;a href="https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/oral-carcinoma-associated-with-chronic-use-of-electronic-cigarettes-2161-119X-1000304.php?aid=88343"&gt;isolated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33926987/"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; have found a connection between vaping and mouth cancer. Some studies have also suggested that people who both vape and smoke (so-called dual users) have a &lt;a href="https://www.gavinpublishers.com/article/view/vaping-smoking-and-lung-cancer-risk"&gt;higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of lung cancer than people who only smoke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, the overall research to date doesn’t appear to &lt;a href="https://www.tobaccoinduceddiseases.org/Evidence-update-on-the-cancer-risk-of-vaping-e-cigarettes-A-systematic-review,192934,0,2.html#:~:text=No%20significant%20incident%20or%20prevalent%20risk%20of%20lung%20cancer%20or%20other%20types%20of%20cancer%20was%20found%20in%20the%20never%20smoker%20current%20vapers%20population."&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; a significant added risk of lung cancer among people who only vape and have never smoked. And studies have also long found that vaping is &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/quit-smoking/ready-to-quit-smoking/vaping-to-quit-smoking/vaping-myths-and-the-facts/#:~:text=Myth%201%3A%20Vaping%20is%20just%20as%20harmful%20as%20smoking&amp;amp;text=Nicotine%20vaping%20is%20not%20risk,of%20the%20risks%20of%20smoking%22."&gt;less harmful&lt;/a&gt; in general than smoking. Given that this case is only one anecdote, the doctors aren’t pushing for formal changes to screening guidelines just yet. But they are calling for further studies to untangle the unique dangers that vaping may pose.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

These symptoms, which can include exhaustion, difficulty concentrating, and muscle weakness, often begin within minutes to hours after orgasm and can persist for several days. Although the condition has been largely observed in men, there is growing, albeit limited, evidence that it may also affect women. A new scientific review published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12119-025-10372-x" target="_blank"&gt;Sexuality &amp;amp; Culture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; offers the most up-to-date summary of what is currently known about POIS, highlighting its symptoms, possible causes, and a wide range of treatment attempts—none of which has proven universally effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted the review because POIS remains an under-recognized condition with no established diagnostic criteria in medical manuals and no agreed-upon treatment approach. Since it was first described in 2002, only a handful of studies have attempted to systematically explore its causes and potential treatments. The review authors aimed to provide a clearer overview of the scientific literature to help both clinicians and patients better understand the condition and guide future research efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To carry out the review, the authors searched the PubMed database for articles with references to POIS in their titles, abstracts, or keywords. This initial search produced 429 results, which were then narrowed down to English-language studies published between 2020 and 2025. After removing irrelevant or duplicate entries, the authors were left with 29 articles that met their inclusion criteria. These papers formed the basis for their review of the latest knowledge surrounding POIS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors began by reviewing the symptoms and diagnostic criteria most commonly associated with POIS. Because the condition is not formally recognized by diagnostic systems like the International Classification of Diseases or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, researchers have had to rely on informal criteria. The most widely accepted standards were developed by Dutch psychiatrist Marcel Waldinger and his team, based on reports from 45 male patients. These criteria include flu-like symptoms such as fatigue, feverishness, and irritability; onset of symptoms shortly after ejaculation; recurrence in nearly every ejaculation; and a duration of symptoms typically lasting between two and seven days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later research has expanded upon these findings. In what remains the largest study of POIS to date, researcher Natale and colleagues in 2020 surveyed 302 men, 268 of whom met at least three of Waldinger’s diagnostic criteria. The most commonly reported symptoms were difficulty concentrating (reported by 84% of participants), extreme fatigue (83%), irritability (74%), and muscle weakness (70%). Many participants said they avoided sexual activity, masturbation, or even romantic relationships to prevent the debilitating symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While POIS has historically been viewed as a male-only condition, newer reports suggest it may also affect women. However, these cases are rare and under-documented, and more research is needed to understand how the condition manifests in female patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause of POIS remains a subject of intense debate. Early studies proposed that it might be an allergic or autoimmune reaction to a person’s own semen. Waldinger’s research supported this hypothesis through allergy skin tests, which showed positive results in a large majority of POIS patients. A few case studies even documented successful treatment through desensitization therapy using diluted samples of the patient’s semen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet more recent studies have cast doubt on the allergic explanation. Some patients do not show typical allergy responses, and semen-specific antibodies are not always present. Other researchers have proposed alternative explanations, including the idea that POIS may stem from a chemical imbalance in the brain, a dysregulated immune or hormone response, or nervous system dysfunction. A particularly novel theory suggests that POIS results from minor nerve damage in the pelvic muscles responsible for ejaculation, similar to conditions that cause delayed muscle pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The varied and sometimes conflicting findings suggest that POIS may have multiple causes. Different patients may experience the condition due to different underlying mechanisms, making it difficult to define a one-size-fits-all explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to physical symptoms, POIS is frequently associated with mental health problems. Studies have reported high rates of depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder in those affected. One study found that 87.5% of POIS patients had at least one of these conditions. Another found a lower, but still significant, rate of 45%. Many individuals also experience premature ejaculation, likely due to low sexual activity or anxiety about triggering symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the exact cause of POIS remains unknown, treatment has been inconsistent and largely experimental. Doctors have tried a wide range of medications and therapies, targeting the suspected underlying causes. In the 2020 Natale study, some of the more commonly used medications included antihistamines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (commonly used to treat depression), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Of these, niacin and anti-inflammatory drugs appeared to be most effective for the highest number of participants, but still only helped a portion of those who tried them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other approaches have included hormone therapy, especially in men with low testosterone levels, and psychological interventions like relaxation techniques. A few cases have reported positive outcomes from desensitization therapy or immunotherapy. In one recent and unusual case, a man underwent surgery to block semen from interacting with immune cells in his body and reportedly saw his symptoms disappear. Another case reported improvement after undergoing a microbiota transplant to alter gut bacteria, though it’s unclear whether this treatment played a direct role in his recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the limited number of documented cases and the diversity in symptom expression and treatment outcomes, no official guidelines exist for treating POIS. Most medical professionals are unfamiliar with the condition, and some patients report difficulty discussing their symptoms due to embarrassment or stigma around sexual health. The authors of the review stress the need for personalized approaches to treatment and encourage clinicians to work closely with patients to identify potential triggers and helpful interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While earlier reviews on POIS exist, this new article includes a larger and more recent body of research. The authors recommend that POIS be considered for inclusion in formal disease classification systems like the ICD or DSM to promote awareness and improve clinical recognition. They also emphasize the importance of continuing to explore the condition in both men and women and testing treatment strategies in larger patient samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12119-025-10372-x" target="_blank"&gt;Postorgasmic Illness Syndrome: Insights from Recent Literature on a Rare but Fascinating Disorder&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Krystian Wdowiak, Agnieszka Maciocha, and Julia Wąż.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 14:05:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxNYl9zcllwS0JjV3hQc2xkR2ZwR2l4aWJHTHkxTXN2d0gzOEZDWTdGT0c0dEEyNUdObE1IZ0VMZEt6TEFHU2p6S1U4bVEwV1VmdVg5dmJfb1lJTHVGeTlXTHNhcXY5bnpyb0FNMjdhVlNqR09NMGZfZzlpNGtWZmxKdVFUa3NsekhNMDliY2FJeTFxR1RaZW1uamxDOVlQRXlKUFNESWhvcnI4RkdUdF92a3hrSXQ3MUk4WHBRRkc0OTQyVV9NVUFV</guid></item><item><title>肾脏健康和不安腿综合征解释：症状、原因和治愈方法-印度时报 | Kidney health and Restless Legs Syndrome explained: Symptoms, causes, and cure - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgJBVV95cUxQNEJ3WEVzZzFVdjA4LUh4V1oyUWZ0R0JPb0d1bWE2RVlVVlI3NGVDVHVoWEpuMzF3UjEteXpLUTZJc3ZhUnNvVEk1eFZIQk81LXVCQXlOQ05KaWdQVEJudlFUNHU5eHBPbU5CVENRajBJbXQtOHBVLTczVFhPNmlPcUJmclVpOTZSaHB0ZS1BTEJrLU9hQlZXYUhXXzNyZmhSbUR0M2NrTVdoemJmdmdoS2t3anBMcmFCclJQSV9KXzQ5ejBkWE5NWVRmeXlMWTUwbGxnN0dSSmlZeXI1bnlWaE4tZWlObThXbmpjc09rbEZpUjlhS3RMLTQ4WXJ3SUJjQU1EV1l30gGLAkFVX3lxTE83Q1dhZHU5WThTZDF1aWRWMWxkQTJyYzRDRUpMVU1yOVd6cUZYXy1ZVk1LYzB1RC14V0dSbU5od0I3aWk4MVRraFBxNHRPTzFFY3k1OGdRaWNkUDZjODhFS3VwaThkNW9LTy1UbFQyYjM1dmM3dUxiWjZhSU9jaUN3T0h3TnBvdkUwTmNzNXd3b2RqTDdfbC1IcWdsTzdTNkJhVzhzNEVNQTZuX0Q5cy1qQlljOGN2eElsM3YzZE9MM2l5bThpUFNfaTh4bUN0d29XaEdlSDYzeHJZZG95MUdwcy1leHFfNVFaX2hhM3ZCSHVkanViMHRpMHBpbFdJOTZPZ1VjVkpwR2t1MA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study has identified chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients—especially those undergoing dialysis—as a group at significantly higher risk of developing Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). The research highlights that RLS symptoms are highly prevalent in this population and are closely associated with iron deficiency, a condition frequently seen in CKD due to chronic inflammation, poor dietary intake, and blood loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2016 meta-analysis found that nearly one in four CKD patients experiences RLS, with higher rates among those on hemodialysis. Further, brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid studies have shown lower iron concentrations in certain areas in RLS patients, suggesting that central, rather than peripheral, iron deficiency is more relevant to symptom development. In CKD, this imbalance is often worsened by dialysis-related blood loss and systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study further noted that CKD patients with RLS had lower levels of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and serum iron, along with elevated TIBC, pointing to both absolute and functional iron deficiency. These findings underscore the importance of early detection and iron-targeted therapy in managing RLS symptoms and improving overall quality of life in CKD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What is Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restless Legs Syndrome—also called Willis-Ekbom Disease—is a neurological and sensory condition characterized by an uncontrollable urge to move the legs. It typically occurs during periods of rest or inactivity, especially in the evening or at night, making it a sleep-disrupting disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition tends to worsen in the evening and improves with movement. People often describe the sensations as aching, itching, throbbing, crawling, or pulling in the legs. Though it mostly affects the legs, it can occasionally impact the arms too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Signs and symptoms of RLS&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RLS symptoms can range from mild to severe and vary from person to person. Some of its key features include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discomfort after resting: Symptoms typically start when you're sitting or lying down for long periods, for example during a long drive, or while watching a move in a theatre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relief with movement: Stretching, pacing, or leg simple movement helps temporarily improve the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worse at night: Many experience trouble falling or staying asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Night time twitching: RLS may be associated with another, more common condition called periodic limb movement of sleep, wherein the legs twitch and kick during sleep, possibly throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impact on mood and focus: Chronic fatigue, depression, and difficulty concentrating are common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In severe cases, RLS symptoms occur more than twice a week and can interfere with work, social life, and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What causes RLS?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, there's no known cause for restless legs syndrome. However several contributing factors have been identified. Genetics appear to play a role, as RLS often runs in families. One of the most significant medical links is iron deficiency, especially low levels of iron in the brain, which interferes with dopamine production—an essential chemical for smooth muscle control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;RLS is also frequently seen in people with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, kidney disease, and peripheral neuropathy. Additionally, problems in the brain’s dopamine pathways, similar to those seen in Parkinson’s disease, have been associated with RLS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Managing RLS: What helps?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently there is no cure for RLS but its symptoms can often be managed with the right combination of treatment and lifestyle adjustments. The first step towards tackling the issue is to address and acknowledge underlying conditions like iron deficiency, diabetes, or sleep apnea. People with RLS are often advised to avoid or limit their intake of caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine, especially in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to reduce the nighttime symptoms, it has been observed that Creating a regular sleep routine and maintaining a calming bedtime environment has a positive effect on the body. Further, warm baths, leg massages, or the use of heating pads and ice packs also give relief. Some devices like vibration pads or specially designed foot wraps that apply gentle pressure have also proved to provide temporary relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 13:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在主要研究中，医生发出警告，因为常见的睡眠习惯与过早死亡的风险有关-每日邮报 | Doctors issue warning as common sleep habit is linked to risk of early death in major study - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNaDFLLWM2RnpHMi1tUU15Q21sOWtZOHZmSnJHSHZvT2tnd0JaU0phOUw5TFNNbkZUWFYzc2VnOTQ1UFNybXJDU1Q5S0hJVjhrdjZ3TFg1QjNDcGN0VkJaVS1aVGpQaUM3VnFVNUNkdVNHUDE2ZzJCaHVwenQ1UWVsWlJtVi1QNEhCekZMY1haRmhXMUJXcjc4Yi1QVHNvSkXSAaQBQVVfeXFMTk9VU0ozalY1eURtbnUtTXZSc0xTeTRYaHA1Q3o5WXRKWUxLSmtpSDF4S0RvNDc5a2Q0TTZEcmREaDZqOVRHcnFoUVhyRVg3MU1STWhqcXZCUEp0dmVsM2E3M0FDQ2d1ZGxlc3BNUW5tSlpSSGtvWHBLaVIyZG1STHhEUWxxV210bERZU3FVcTlQZ1pWNmhlZUNqTHE5czdPdjdiOFQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Daytime napping may be linked to a higher risk of early death, according to a major new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The discovery was made by researchers who tracked the sleep habits of more than 86,000 healthy middle-aged adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that those who regularly napped—particularly in the early afternoon—were more likely to die prematurely than those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, presented at the SLEEP 2025 conference, found the risk of death rose by up to 20 per cent among frequent nappers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say daytime sleepiness may be a warning sign of disrupted or poor-quality night-time rest, and could point to underlying health problems such as sleep disorders, dementia, or heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor James Rowley, from Rush University Medical Center in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/chicago/index.html" id="mol-5b7c6590-4dd4-11f0-bd39-15654a550036"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, who was not involved in the research, said the findings should influence how doctors ask patients about sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The major take-home message is that if a doctor asks about a patient's sleep habits, they should also be asking about napping,' he told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/napping-patterns-older-adults-tied-all-cause-mortality-2025a1000fn3"&gt;Medscape&lt;/a&gt; Medical News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In other words, doctors should be asking their patients, 'Do you nap in the day?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers found that longer naps, inconsistent napping schedules and napping around midday could increase the risk of early death&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. The disease can cause anxiety, confusion and short-term memory loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study focused on middle-aged adults who did not work night shifts and had no major health problems at the outset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This helped to rule out other explanations for excessive daytime sleepiness and suggesting that the link with earlier death may not simply be due to existing illness or lifestyle factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants' sleep was assessed over a week-long period, using actigraphy—a method for monitoring a person's sleep-wake patterns using a small, watch-like device called an actigraph. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Daytime napping was defined as sleep between 9am and 7pm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, participants napped for around 24 minutes, with approximately a third of naps taken in the morning, between 9 and 11am. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During a follow-up period of 11 years, 5,189 of the participants died and overall, researchers noted that as people got older, they slept for longer later in the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After adjusting for potentially confounding lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol use and nighttime sleep duration, results showed that a less consistent napping routine was associated with a 14 per cent increased risk of mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists found the highest risk of death was seen in people who slept for the longest during the day, with people who nap between 11am and 1pm experiencing a seven per cent increased risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Around 900,000 Britons are currently thought to have the memory-robbing disorder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead researcher, Professor Chenlu Gao, from Harvard Medical School, said: 'Our study fills a gap in knowledge by showing that it's not just whether someone naps but how long, how variable, and when they nap may be meaningful indicators of future health risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While many studies have examined the links between sleep and mortality, they have largely focused on nighttime sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, napping is an important component of the 24-hour-sleep-wake cycle and may carry its own health implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our findings suggest that certain patterns of napping could serve as early indications of declining health.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers warned that further research is needed to better understand the biological pathways underlying these associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They noted that longer or more irregular naps could reflect underlying health problems such as heart disease, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14365571/Coffee-reduce-type-2-diabetes.html"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, depression and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other studies suggest the explanation may lie with the impact on our circadian rhythms—the natural sleep-wake cycles that determine a host of bodily functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts, from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, also argued that being asleep during the daytime could impact the brain's ability to clear waste that builds up during the day. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come after a landmark study last year suggested almost half of all cases of Alzheimer's disease—the most common cause of dementia—could be prevented by tackling 14 lifestyle factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These included hearing loss, high cholesterol, vision loss and lack of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts claimed the study, published in the prestigious journal The Lancet, provided more hope than 'ever before' that the disorder that blights the lives of millions can be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's Disease affects 982,000 people in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's Research UK analysis found 74,261 people died from dementia in 2022 compared with 69,178 a year earlier, making it the country's biggest killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2019 estimate put the annual death toll at 70,000 people a year with the health issues caused costing the NHS £700million each year to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The WHO puts the annual global death toll from physical inactivity at around 2million per year, making it in the running to be among the top 10 leading causes of global death and disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Lots of people still take it, despite studies showing it can increase your mortality rate—this is any multivitamin supplement'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They [multivitamins] often have more than 100 per cent of the recommended daily allowances for all your vitamins and minerals which can be dangerous.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS says most people should get all the nutrients they need by having a varied and balanced diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average male adult needs around 700 micrograms (µg) of vitamin A a day, and women 600µg, according to the health service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But some multivitamins sold on the high street can &lt;span&gt;contain a much higher dose at 800µg per tablet. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unlike other supplements that are difficult to overdose on, as excess comes out in your urine, multivitamins containing higher levels of vitamin A and vitamin K could also remain in the body as they're fat soluble.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Ahmed &lt;/span&gt;said: 'For things like vitamin A and vitamin K which are fat soluble it can be quite dangerous and potentially in the long term can lead to liver failure, bone problems, and even bleeding and blood clot disorders.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fat soluble vitamins can accumulate in the body over time in the liver and fatty tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If consumed in excess, however, this can&lt;span&gt; weaken the bones, and damage the kidney and the heart.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The NHS says most people should get all the nutrients they need by having a varied and balanced diet &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taking vitamin D at high doses for an extended period of time can also cause complications like hypercalcemia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is where excess calcium is deposited into the bloodstream, increasing the risk of heart and kidney disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ahmed advised people who are worried they are not getting enough essential vitamins and minerals to take one specific supplement for their needs—for example, vitamin D supplements too boost bone health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ahmed also said a healthy balanced diet that includes lots of oily fish, fortified foods and fibre is the best way to get all the essential vitamins the body needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'One thing that is fantastic that I take every day is a seed mixture,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I get the milled version, where they take out the hard shell, to help with digestion and some say it can also increase the nutrient absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is super high in fibre and protein and its got so many minerals and vitamins in it as well. It's a food not a supplement so this is probably the best way to make sure you get all the trace elements you need in your diet,' he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as the latest official figures show the number of Brits being hospitalised for malnutrition and nutritional deficiencies has almost tripled in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2022, there were more than 800,000 admissions in England and Wales with conditions linked to poor nutrition, including 'Victorian' illnesses scurvy and rickets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iron deficiency was the biggest problem, NHS data revealed, with admissions for the bone-weakening condition shooting up by 149 per cent since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research has, however, shown that multivitamins may serve no real health benefits.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2018, a major study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that the most popular supplements — multivitamins, vitamin D, calcium, and vitamin C — made no difference to the risk of heart disease, stroke or early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Folate — found in leafy greens and eggs — and other B-vitamins were seen to offer some reduced risk of heart disease, although the authors noted that the evidence for this was 'low to moderate quality'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 12:38:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>HPV疫苗在预防宫颈癌方面非常有效-健康专家- GhanaWeb | HPV vaccine highly effective in preventing cervical cancer - Health expert - GhanaWeb</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiywFBVV95cUxOREhlVGRBRHJHWV9nMW5nc0YyRlJSVk1DRFJqVVdDdHF2SmxhUFJ4WDlqTDlvdU1NVGUzQ3pqUk9HbFRWdGpfaWpGczdMWUU0bW9CMHJ2ZG51SXlyUkllcS1QZjRZTUNBREI3ZVVNS3U2RFVZVFZWMVV6QWVKS3lkRHlQQ2Q5cF80aE1Melp1bjRvZkFjS1h1MjNnM1JvRkYycnppS0RVUkx2Zm11QTJtRzItWng4YV9jbWFFRm1EdmszU0pON2JMLUlONA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-left"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="article-content-area"&gt;&lt;p id="article-123"&gt;A general medical practitioner, Dr Julian Nii Ardey Ansah, has highlighted the benefits of the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine in the prevention of various types of cancers and genital warts. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
According to Dr Ansah, the HPV vaccine protects against infections caused by the types of HPV responsible for more than 90 percent of cervical cancers, as well as most cases of anal, vulvar, vaginal, penile, oropharyngeal (throat) cancers, as it prevents about 90 percent of genital warts.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Speaking in an interview with GhanaWeb on June 20, 2025, the medical expert described the vaccine as ‘highly effective’ and urged the public to prioritise early vaccination.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“The earlier we vaccinate, the better the chances of preventing these life-threatening diseases. Parents, schools, and health authorities must work together to ensure young people are protected at the right time," he emphasised.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He explained that the vaccine provides nearly 100 percent protection against cervical pre-cancers linked to HPV types 16 and 18 when administered before exposure. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“This is why it’s most effective when given to young people before they become sexually active,” he stated.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Dr Ansah also assured the public that the HPV vaccine is generally safe. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He listed common side effects as; pain, redness, or swelling at the injection area, as well as mild fever, headache, nausea, fatigue, dizziness, or fainting particularly among adolescents, stating that rare side effects may include allergic reactions or syncope (fainting).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
However, he noted that the vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy and advised women to wait until after childbirth before receiving it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On the recommended age for vaccination, Dr Ansah said the ideal time for boys and girls to receive the vaccine is between the ages of 9 and 14, using a two-dose schedule at 0 and 6–12 months. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The recommended dose for children aged 15 to 26, is a three-dose catch-up schedule which can advisedly be administered at 0, 1–2, and 6 months. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Adults aged 27 to 45 may also be vaccinated following consultation with a healthcare provider, although the benefit is considered less effective due to possible prior exposure to HPV.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Dr Ansah concluded by encouraging parents and guardians to take proactive steps in safeguarding their children’s health by ensuring timely vaccination.&lt;br&gt;

Carbohydrates such as bread, pasta, fruit, and sweets are broken down to glucose in the digestive system, which then enters the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After eating, a hormone called insulin briefly rises in the body to help absorb glucose from the blood, so it can be used as energy. In healthy individuals, the body tightly regulates blood sugar levels, keeping them within a narrow range — about 4.0-4.5mmol/L when fasting, and no more than 7.8mmo/L two hours after a meal, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;British Heart Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, even healthy individuals experience after-meal spikes which sometimes reach levels similar to those seen in diabetics, and often go unnoticed. These sudden surges can trigger energy crashes, sugar cravings and mood swings in the short term.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over a longer period, frequent high blood sugar peaks can contribute to low-grade inflammation, impaired insulin sensitivity and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease — even in people without diagnosed diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The good news is you don't need to banish carbohydrates from your diet to keep blood sugar levels in check. Instead, health coach and parliamentary advisor Steve Bennett suggests a slow and steady approach, pairing carbs with foods that digest more slowly to help smooth out those peaks and troughs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31890044" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;span class="caption" itemprop="description"&gt;You don't need to say no to carbs, you just need to eat them correctly&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steve says: "Big blood sugar spikes are primarily caused by ultra-processed carbohydrates, especially those stripped of fibre." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added: "Incorporating fibre (vegetables, salads, and whole grains), protein (lean meats, legumes, or tofu) and healthy fats (avocado, nuts, and olive oil) at every meal slows the absorption of sugars and helps maintain steady blood glucose levels."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theweirdsciencedrop.substack.com/p/the-weird-science-drop-9-sunken-ships" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scientists have pinpointed the exact two years in your life when you age the fastest. Much more on this in our weekly newsletter here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;How to avoid blood sugar spikes&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over time, repeated big blood sugar spikes contribute to insulin resistance (where your body is less able to regulate its blood sugar levels), increasing the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and even accelerated ageing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Heart disease is the third-leading cause of death in England and Wales, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregistrationsummarytables/2023" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;ONS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/about-us/about-the-charity/our-strategy/statistics#:~:text=Our%20data%20shows%20that%20more,by%20167%2C822%20from%202021%2D22." target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Diabetes UK, which&lt;/a&gt; estimates diabetes levels are at an all-time high.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h5&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Check food packaging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31890081" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;meta itemprop="width" content="615"&gt;
&lt;meta itemprop="height" content="410"&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="publication-theme-indicator"&gt;
&lt;span class="caption" itemprop="description"&gt;A meal packed with protein, healthy fats and fibre is great for your blood sugar levels&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steve says: “Hidden sugars in 'healthy' foods like granola bars, fruit juices, low-fat yoghurts, and smoothies often contain as much sugar as desserts and are big spikers. Unexpected culprits like rice cakes (higher glycemic index than sugar), dried fruit, sushi with white rice, and even sweet potato fries can trigger large glucose spikes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He recommends checking labels for key indicators that food will spike your blood sugar:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 5g of sugar per 100g may cause moderate spikes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above 10g per 100g is likely to trigger significant glucose elevation (often marked red on food labels)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aim for products where fibre is at least half the sugar content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h5&gt;2. Eat fibre first&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;Data from the Food &amp;amp; Drink Federation reveals that only 9% of adults meet the recommended 30g of fibre per day. A new survey from &lt;a href="https://www.saga.co.uk/health-insurance" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Saga Health Insurance&lt;/a&gt; suggests this shortfall may be driving blood sugar crashes, cravings, brain fog, and potential long-term health issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eating high-fibre foods before a meal can significantly reduce glucose spikes. Instead of cutting out your favourite carb-heavy snacks, start with a salad, raw vegetables, or a handful of nuts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Combining high-carb foods with protein and healthy fats helps slow digestion and moderate glucose impact. For example, pair dark chocolate with almonds or have berries alongside a dessert.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;3. Make smart swaps&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;For Brits looking to swap a chocolate bar for a satisfying, balanced snack, Steve recommends Greek yoghurt with berries, chia seed pudding, hummus with vegetables, some nuts or a boiled egg.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steve suggests replacing white rice with cauliflower rice for meals, using leafy greens instead of tortillas, and swapping tropical fruits for lower-glycemic berries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31890062" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;span class="caption" itemprop="description"&gt;Energy crashes and sugar cravings are signs of high blood glucose spikes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h5&gt;4. Move after meals&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;You don't need to do intense exercise to be healthy. It turns out you can eat your favourite foods in moderation and resist sugar spikes by taking a 10-minute walk after eating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steve notes that this can reduce glucose spikes by up to 30%. Gentle movement helps muscles use up excess sugar before it accumulates, he explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;5. Avoid nighttime snacks&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bodies become more insulin-resistant in the evening, meaning the same food eaten at night causes a higher glucose response than if it were eaten earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The health coach explained: "Nighttime spikes disrupt sleep quality, impair overnight cellular repair, and contribute to morning brain fog. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"They also interfere with growth hormone release, which happens primarily during deep sleep and is essential for tissue repair and metabolic health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 11:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPX2tlalZhb2xwWm5lajdMYXNyWDR6TFlucEEwSUxid05NVEFGUFdhS0xKUnpBYmVQbE5zQldHemFYTFdlN1g4bFY2UFl4LUR3cHp0S1ZBbGRYa0RMYzVhTnQ3ZmExVlJiU0lTdjgwRDNJOV9LbVI4TGRTQW1QaXlwNnJYVQ</guid></item><item><title>通过吃一种含有“关键”营养素的水果来帮助降低血压- Surrey Live | Help lower blood pressure by eating one fruit with 'crucial' nutrient - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPbUM1ZS1DZnpoQjVqejlnUXR2RnFMQkNkSXJrNjhwZDBMV09WcGExUlVRYjBLV3g3T2lKOW5MRm15aWlVMHlsNHBXN2NOMm5uT2JWU3VTS0NRMEFUdThGTURGeWZoX1V3cFpPeVkwSFFBMVUzTXg4SGVXNzRUQ09JZ1kyWGZVdm1H?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating a wide variety of fruit and vegetables &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/eat-30-plants-week-improve-30701080" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;is good for our health&lt;/a&gt; and the more different plants you can eat the more nutrients you will be getting into your system and the healthier &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/gut-health-score-93-out-30672961" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;your gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; will be. Some experts suggest &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/eat-30-plants-week-improve-30701080" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;30 plants a week&lt;/a&gt; is a good number to aim for. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most of us will have heard about the importance of vitamins to our bodies since we were children. But there are many other important nutrients that we hear a lot less about, despite their importance to our health. Among them is magnesium, which is involved in more than 300 reactions in the body, registered dietitian Patricia Bannan &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/fruits-with-high-magnesium-rcna202425" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;told Today&lt;/a&gt;. But "despite its importance, about half of US adults don’t get enough magnesium from food", she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are simple ways to increase your magnesium intake — and you can do it simply from eating the foods you come across easily in any supermarket, instead of having to spend a fortune on expensive food or supplements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is magnesium and why is it important?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Magnesium is a mineral that helps several bodily functions, including:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;turning the food we eat into energy&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; making sure our cells, organs and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9820677/#:~:text=Magnesium%20(Mg)%20is%20involved%20in,of%20the%20blood%E2%80%93brain%20barrier" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;brains are functioning as they should&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;stabilising moods&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;maintaining our muscles&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;aiding vitamin D in travelling around the body&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;making sure the glands which aid bone health work normally.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;As well as the above, scientific research also shows it may play a role in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/5/429?ref=circle-magazine-health-wellness-genetics-blog" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;improving symptoms of anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28654669/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;mild depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35184264/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;help improve sleep&lt;/a&gt;. There's also evidence that healthy magnesium levels help your heart health. And one review of evidence found that people with higher intakes of magnesium had an &lt;a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/glossary#meta-analysis" rel="nofollow"&gt;8% lower chance of developing high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; than those with the lowest intakes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theweirdsciencedrop.substack.com/p/the-weird-science-drop-9-sunken-ships" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scientists have pinpointed the exact two years in your life when you age the fastest.

&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What fruit is high in magnesium?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; You can get magnesium in several different fruits (and other foods) but one of the best is the &lt;b&gt;passion fruit&lt;/b&gt; , which contains 4-5 grams of magnesium per fruit. One &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.00617/full" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;study in the Frontiers in Pharmacology journal&lt;/a&gt; said that "more than 110 phytochemical constituents" have already been found in the plant which shows "a wide range of health effects and biological activities such as antioxidant, anti-hypertensive, anti-tumor, antidiabetic, hypolipidemic activities". &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It adds: "These outstanding results suggest that passion fruit may offer a range of health benefits, such as managing inflammatory and neurological disease, and also preventing some chronic diseases like hypertension and hyperlipidemia."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today.com notes that "the pulp of the aromatic fruit can be eaten raw, as a yogurt topping, or added to juices and drinks" and adds that it "also tops the list of fruits with the most protein".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What other foods are high in magnesium?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are lots of other good sources of magnesium, including:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;leafy green vegetables like spinach or chard, as well as green peas, sweetcorn and potatoes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;nuts and seeds like almonds, cashews, chia seeds, peanuts and pumpkin seeds&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;legumes like black beans and edamame beans&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;fruits like avocado, banana, papaya, blackberries, kiwis and figs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;dark chocolate&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rebecca McManamon, consultant dietitian and British Dietetic Association spokesperson, told the &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/bbc"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; that you are probably reaching the recommended daily amount of magnesium if you’re eating unsalted nuts or wholegrains daily, along with a variety of fruit, green vegetables and legumes. She added: "If these are not foods you eat regularly, you may be at a higher risk of not getting enough magnesium." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What about supplements?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many scientists adopt the "food first" approach to getting the nutrients we need. Professor Tim Spector, of Kings College London, says he generally believes supplements to be ineffective and that, unless people are dealing with specific health issues, most of us should be able to get the nutrients we need from food. And registered dietitian Anna Taylor told the Cleveland Clinic: "Food first is my mantra. If you take a dietary supplement for magnesium and take too much, you may experience uncomfortable side effects such as cramping, diarrhea and nausea."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How do I know if I'm eating enough magnesium?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taylor told the Cleveland Clinic that eating the following would be a good way of getting the amount of magnesium your body needs:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Five servings of fruits and vegetables per day&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;At least three servings of whole grains per day&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;One ounce of nuts or seeds per day&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;One serving of legumes most days of the week.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it's important to note that if you eat those recommended amounts, you'll also be getting several other nutrients and health benefits that those food contains, including fibre. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 11:38:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPbUM1ZS1DZnpoQjVqejlnUXR2RnFMQkNkSXJrNjhwZDBMV09WcGExUlVRYjBLV3g3T2lKOW5MRm15aWlVMHlsNHBXN2NOMm5uT2JWU3VTS0NRMEFUdThGTURGeWZoX1V3cFpPeVkwSFFBMVUzTXg4SGVXNzRUQ09JZ1kyWGZVdm1H</guid></item><item><title>Ozempic时代正在迫使精英阶层改变健康休养地-《华盛顿邮报》 | The Ozempic era is forcing wellness retreats for the elite to change - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOU1psSHVlT3pITnV4QkVzUXg4clhvd2x4VllSRHk5TXh6VDd0RUtUYS1ILWtnY05rSnk3LS1iYlRVMXpZcUtySm91X2pCS1NjbGVsVWNSYVE5ZnhwQVQ5d0dCeHc5V2RrUUt0QS1DQ3dmZU84YVNwNWhXRnViMTJ5aVNWYUtUUFI1?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="53Z432Y3SRG5NAJUCFCJNQWYJM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It was 3 p.m., and already Mitra Mechanic had completed a yoga class and a four-hour guided hike.

The cost of that week? $6,900 per person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EHLVSGXUFRDTBMWR7WACDUOHKE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On paper, Mechanic was looking for a “reset” after a stressful period. But like many of her fellow attendees, she was also hoping to slim down on the rigorous program. She was prescribed the highest dose of the GLP-1 prescription weight loss medication Mounjaro for her Type 2 diabetes, but she hadn’t experienced the transformative weight loss many people report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BSFBHEC7JZCVTCZ4KO5IKYHBUA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I’m some sort of a unicorn case,” she sighed.

Twenty-five years later, medications like Mounjaro and Ozempic can yield dramatic weight loss while requiring less money and effort than a luxury wellness retreat. In response, Mountain Trek and similar retreats are evolving to meet the needs of a new type of guest: medicated, motivated and seeking support. Some wish to supercharge their weight loss progress, while others need help mitigating unwanted side effects such as digestive discomfort and significant muscle loss.

Starting at $12,200 for six nights, it enlists a nutritionist, hiking guide and personal trainer to help guests build muscle, improve overall fitness and learn about optimal nutrition. The offering has been “quite popular,” according to Glasscock, and the company expects interest to grow alongside the ubiquity of weight-loss medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KEPPWPQ4KJG2XGCCUP2447AVLY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pritikin.com/wellness-retreat" target="_blank"&gt;Pritikin Longevity Center&lt;/a&gt; in South Florida says about 10 percent of its guests are taking GLP-1s. A two-week stay at the center starts at $14,000 and includes a personalized program devised by physicians, nutritionists, trainers and psychologists. Each retreat typically begins with a medical consultation including blood panels, an exercise tolerance test and a DEXA body scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MI5GD3XH2ZEYPKCIVRMVM65EVY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“There’s a big percentage of the population that either has tried them already or that will use them, and we know this is not going anywhere,” said Pritikin’s medical director Marianela Areces, who says the center can make a partner with the drugs instead of an enemy. “Our program is actually helping guests that are on these medications to be able to tolerate them and stay on them and avoid the side effects, or mitigate some of the negative effects that these medications may have.” A new Pritikin meal plan called the GLP-1 Plate, for example, increases the serving of protein to prevent muscle loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AGKJG4UL4ZHFPFIFK3IDM3ZNTQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Occasionally, Pritikin’s on-site physicians will prescribe GLP-1s as part of a patient’s customized weight loss program. Last year in April, the center hosted a 30-year-old man for a month-long stay. His goal, Areces said, was to start taking Mounjaro under the supervision of the center’s doctors, which he did alongside a high-protein, low-fat diet and weight-resistance exercises. By the fall, adhering to Pritikin’s strategy had produced the desired result. During a subsequent week-long visit, a body composition test indicated he’d lost 80 pounds while preserving muscle mass, Areces said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UQIVZJBKPVCFXL3G3ZA5646XTY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That Pritikin guest declined to be interviewed, but according to Areces, the results of&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;his hard work in the gym and kitchen gave him the confidence to begin slowly reducing the medication under the guidance of Pritikin’s endocrinologist. “He was very motivated, and he wanted to come off. He’s like, ‘I can do this,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="6XC4IK7UYFG3RFPLKSMJHK5C4Y" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="6XC4IK7UYFG3RFPLKSMJHK5C4Y" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What a magic shot doesn’t provide&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HY4UAW5MT5EYHHVMLV5VVNOCIM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On the final morning of her Mountain Trek retreat, Mechanic reported to a private office behind the gym for her final weigh-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3CXATFKG5NAIDNABNVLFIPLY7Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I lost six or seven pounds in the week, which I hadn’t [done] this entire time on Mounjaro,” she said. Back in Austin, Mechanic’s doctor also ran a blood test to see how a week of extreme wellness had affected her blood sugar levels. “He was stunned at how much of a significant drop it had,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="62KTP7BWIRFONKM3E4I5Z73J2Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Weight loss, lower blood sugar and better digestion are virtually guaranteed in a luxury health retreat’s structured, temptation-free world, but integrating the program’s teachings back home is challenging. Mechanic has regained some of the weight she lost at Mountain Trek, but she says other lessons from the experience have stuck, particularly the “de-stressing and relaxation piece.” Her menopausal sleep issues have improved, and she occasionally visits a local cold plunge studio for its reputed metabolism-boosting, inflammation-lowering benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7WJS4WDUMJE45DLL6Z44WR3G4M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Is a Mountain Trek retreat worth its high price tag? Mechanic says it is. She’s completed the program twice and hopes to return for a third time this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WGS5GCXGS5GZ7DCX3GELF5SERA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“That sense of accomplishment at the end of the week is really pretty invaluable,” she said, reflecting on a world where so much — including weight loss — is increasingly effortless. “When you finish the week of Mountain Trek, you look back at the lows, like when you’re on a mountain you’re ready to jump off because you’re so winded, and then the highs of sitting in the hot tub at the end of the day, chatting with the group, looking at the beautiful scenery. For me, it was like, &lt;i&gt;my body was able to do that. &lt;/i&gt;It’s much more than weight loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LQ3LX4OUQBAMPE4RYDF34KYEEE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Esme Benjamin is a freelance travel and wellness writer based in New York City.

The drug, an antiretroviral, works not by stimulating an immune response, but by blocking HIV from reproducing during its early stages—specifically, by disrupting the function of the virus’s capsid protein. This happens so long as the body receives injections every six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Lenacapavir has already been approved in some countries as a treatment for HIV in people with forms of the virus that are resistant to other treatments. However, prior to this week, its prophylactic use had not been approved anywhere, making the FDA’s decision a significant new development in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The drug is not the first medicine that can be taken preemptively to protect against an HIV infection: pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pills were already available in many countries, including the United States. But these must be taken every day, and ensuring ongoing access to these medicines, and that people actually remember to take them, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/lenacapavir-usaid-hiv-aids-funding-cuts/"&gt;is a known challenge&lt;/a&gt;.

This kind of testing – monitoring the health of people who regularly work with H5N1-infected animals – is how the vast majority of cases (64 out of 70) have been found in this outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But then, several CDC officials overseeing the bird flu response were &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/trump-health-layoffs-include-staff-overseeing-bird-flu-response-source-says-2025-04-01/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; on 1 April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since then, only about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;50 people&lt;/a&gt; in the US have been tested after exposure to sick animals – and no positive cases have been announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s also been difficult to understand the extent of the outbreak and how the virus spreads among animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We still just don’t have a good picture of the scope and scale of this outbreak – we never really have.

This funding was used to monitor, test, vaccinate and otherwise respond to public health issues at the state, local, territorial and tribal level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We’re seeing health departments scrambling,” Nuzzo said. “That infrastructure is just dramatically eroding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;International monitoring programs to address outbreaks before they expand across borders have also been cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We have taken for granted all of those protections, and I fear that we are poised to see the consequences,” Nuzzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Trump’s crackdown on immigration also poses a major challenge in detecting cases and treating patients during outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“A lot of the people who are most at risk are strongly disincentivized to report any cases, given that many of them are undocumented or are not US citizens,” Rasmussen said. “Nobody wants to go get tested if they’re going to end up in an Ice detention facility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When cases are not detected, that means patients are not able to access care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although it’s rare for people to become sick with H5N1, for instance – the virus is still primarily an avian, not a human, influenza – this variant of bird flu has a 52% mortality rate globally among people with known infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Allowing a deadly virus to spread and mutate under the radar has troubling implications for its ability to change into a human influenza without anyone knowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;And if such changes were detected, widening gaps in communication could be the next hurdle for preventing a pandemic, Nuzzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Communication is our most important public health intervention. People, in order to be able to know how to protect themselves, need to have access to facts, and they need to believe in the messengers. And the communication around the measles outbreaks are deeply eroding our standing with the American people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Even stockpiled vaccines and other protective measures, like personal protective equipment, take time to distribute, Nuzzo added. “And flu is a fast-moving disease that could cause a lot of damage in the months it would take to mount a vaccination campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The US government’s cancellation of its $766m contract with Moderna to research and develop an H5N1 vaccine also signals a concerning strategy from health officials, Nuzzo and Rasmussen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Other restrictions on vaccine development, like a new plan to test all vaccines against saline placebos, is “going to make it extremely difficult to approve any new vaccine” and would “have a devastating impact on our ability to respond to a potential pandemic”, Rasmussen said – especially in a rapidly moving pandemic where speed matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“You don’t have time for that if this virus causes a human-to–human outbreak,” Rasmussen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;All of these policies mean the US is less prepared for a pandemic than it was in 2020, she said. And it also means there will be preventable suffering now, even before the next big one strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We are actively making people less safe, less healthy and more dead,” Rasmussen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPNF9rb2RSUDhTOEZ6ZmttenFjaHA0RWNJQ0hYbFNTRDVUaG94b3huM0Y1elRPU1U2ajNjUlNhQWhqOUY4ZTdpRjhxNTIyQ1JzV1RBWmZMMVBFLVBYb0xaS3VqN1ZVUXlOcGgzSDZvdWl5OVQwdlItRDdDNE0waFV2YlNnc1Z0YjVJMWRoUGVRSFg4dDVKS19heVpRV3VLQkgt</guid></item><item><title>Wegovy效应：一种新药重塑了肥胖青少年的生活-路透社 | The Wegovy effect: A new drug reshapes the lives of teens with obesity - Reuters</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE1RZmV5TnpwZkZjLXhCRGRIUW4tWTlaYmpPRVdsNUVZQzZLbVgtNHNzcFZCOERNR1NoRzBYSXM2X2dpYWI4N21FQ0szRHFac3JlR2pzYjlGMkFBQzNwY291cUdsSEF0LWJZX3VZcUt6VXk1Zk1rSnEtcjB4d2FLdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE1RZmV5TnpwZkZjLXhCRGRIUW4tWTlaYmpPRVdsNUVZQzZLbVgtNHNzcFZCOERNR1NoRzBYSXM2X2dpYWI4N21FQ0szRHFac3JlR2pzYjlGMkFBQzNwY291cUdsSEF0LWJZX3VZcUt6VXk1Zk1rSnEtcjB4d2FLdw</guid></item><item><title>感染多达30%美国人的常见脑寄生虫干扰神经元通信- IFLScience | Common Brain Parasite Infecting Up To 30 Percent Of Americans Disrupts Neuron Communication - IFLScience</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwgFBVV95cUxOeHFNQ2QxOXBqaXJnZ2NLbmFuQWpZZlo5Z3VaeVV1d2NPcWxBLUdzS3IxOTFZT0tadm8wek5POG1LLVh3R1ZXbE1QX3dJNjlEM05OUlcxM2w0YVByd0xrWlUwcXJLMEJGelUzYzZsUHdZUl9OdEEycDZoSkNkdW5GTHpwVEJDOXU4a1hselk4NDhrTEpwX3hyVk5SbkNnQzBlLVptclY5MTlLQXc5V2g3Sm5IMzB6eVpPd3JjSlc0TzRSQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii &lt;/em&gt;is an opportunistic bugger, capable of infecting pretty much any warm-blooded animal and has a particular preference for living in brain cells. Once someone or something is infected, the parasites form cysts in neurons that can last for life. Many people who are infected by the parasites (around 10 to 30 percent of the US) often don’t even know it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parasite is often contracted from undercooked meat or exposure to cat feces. In many cases, infected people are asymptomatic, but some people do develop flu-like symptoms like fever, muscle aches, headaches, and fatigue. They may also have swollen lymph nodes, particularly in the neck. None of these symptoms are peculiar to the parasite and are common to other infections. Individuals with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;weakened immune systems&lt;/a&gt;, however, can experience more severe symptoms, including confusion, blurred vision, slurred speech, and are unsteady on their feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has even been claimed that getting the parasite can do wonders for your dating life, at least according to one study from &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/people-infected-by-brainaltering-cat-parasite-are-more-attractive-finds-study-63735" target="_blank"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most cases, a person’s immune system will keep the parasite in check, but it can stay dormant in their brains for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, diagnostic tools can only detect whether a person has been exposed to &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt; by identifying antibodies. This, unfortunately, does not tell doctors whether the parasite is still present in the brain or how and to what extent it has impacted their brain function. But that may soon change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new study, researchers at the University of California, Riverside, found that infected neurons release fewer extracellular vesicles (EVs), tiny packets surrounded by a membrane that are used by cells to exchange information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found this disruption in EV signaling can interfere with how neurons and glial cells, especially astrocytes, maintain a healthy brain environment,” Emma H. Wilson, a professor of biomedical sciences in the Riverside School of Medicine, who led the research, explained in a &lt;a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2025/06/18/how-common-brain-parasite-disrupts-neural-communication" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even a handful of infected neurons can shift the brain’s neurochemical balance. This suggests that communication between neurons and supporting glial cells is not only critical, but also vulnerable to hijacking by parasites.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings could represent a new way to use EVs as biomarkers that can be isolated in a person’s blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The existing research has focused on mouse models and human cells in a laboratory setting. In essence, in healthy mouse brains, astrocytes – a type of glial cell that makes up the majority of cells in the central nervous system – regulate neurotransmitters like glutamate. This ensures that neurons do not become overexcited (where a neuron fires signals too rapidly, not that it is looking forward to something). But when infected with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;, the neurons stop sending the right EV signals, resulting in regulation stopping and higher levels of glutamate, which can lead to seizures, neural damage, or altered brain connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The parasite may play a larger role in neurological and behavioral conditions than we previously thought,” Wilson added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson and colleagues are now looking to analyze human blood samples for EVs linked to the parasite infection. They also hope to better understand how glial cells detect and respond to the parasite proteins, potentially offering new therapies or even vaccines in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our brains have built-in defenses that may recognize and respond to neurons infected by &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;,” Wilson explained. “If we can learn how to support or enhance that process, we may be able to better protect people, especially the most vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its impacts, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt; is often misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no need to avoid someone who is infected; most people live their entire lives without symptoms,” Wilson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pregnant individuals should be cautious as the parasite can cause serious birth defects if contracted for the first time during pregnancy. The most effective prevention is proper food handling and hygiene. Cook meat thoroughly, wash vegetables, and always wash your hands after handling cat litter, especially from young cats, which are more likely to shed the parasite.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper is published in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1012733" target="_blank"&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 10:50:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxOeHFNQ2QxOXBqaXJnZ2NLbmFuQWpZZlo5Z3VaeVV1d2NPcWxBLUdzS3IxOTFZT0tadm8wek5POG1LLVh3R1ZXbE1QX3dJNjlEM05OUlcxM2w0YVByd0xrWlUwcXJLMEJGelUzYzZsUHdZUl9OdEEycDZoSkNkdW5GTHpwVEJDOXU4a1hselk4NDhrTEpwX3hyVk5SbkNnQzBlLVptclY5MTlLQXc5V2g3Sm5IMzB6eVpPd3JjSlc0TzRSQQ</guid></item><item><title>40岁的男子死于癌症后，医生告诉他胃痛是由于压力|热门-印度斯坦时报-印度斯坦时报 | 40-year-old man dies of cancer after doctors told him stomach ache was due to stress | Trending - Hindustan Times - Hindustan Times</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/trending/40yearold-man-dies-of-cancer-after-doctors-told-him-stomach-ache-was-due-to-stress-101750415730568.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 40-year-old father of four in the UK died from bowel cancer just eight months after he began experiencing stomach pain, which he initially believed was due to stress, a &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/dad-40-dies-cancer-after-35417374" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="report"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by Mirror UK said.

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The disease-causing bacteria thrive in warm, moist environments and are spread through the urine of infected animals, which can contaminate water or soil. They’re found worldwide, but as temperatures rise due to climate change, they’re becoming increasingly common in cooler areas, including the Northeast, said Marieke Rosenbaum, co-senior author of the study and assistant professor in the Department of Infectious Disease and Global Health at Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Humans can contract the disease when infected water or soil gets into the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24021-leptospirosis" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24021-leptospirosis"&gt;eyes, nose, mouth, or a break in the skin.&lt;/a&gt; Those at highest risk are unsheltered adults, veterinarians, sanitary workers, and farmers. It can be treated with antibiotics when properly diagnosed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Rosenbaum said it’s hard to say how many people have been infected with the disease in Boston, as many don’t get tested because they are asymptomatic or only receive a diagnosis if their illness is severe. But the study did track one human case of leptospirosis from 2018 in the city and found that it likely originated from a rat.

Researchers hope the most recent study, which was published in April, will bring new attention to&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;leptospirosis — one of the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441858/#:~:text=Leptospirosis%20is%20an%20infectious%20disorder,through%20infected%20soil%20or%20water." target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441858/#:~:text=Leptospirosis%20is%20an%20infectious%20disorder,through%20infected%20soil%20or%20water."&gt;most common infections transmitted between humans and animals worldwide&lt;/a&gt; but &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31898795/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31898795/"&gt;largely considered neglected&lt;/a&gt; in terms of research — and give public health experts new ideas for how to control rat infestations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s a really unique population of people that are at high risk for contact with rats,” Rosenbaum said. “I hope this will raise some awareness about populations that could be targeted [with interventions], like people who are homeless or are engaged in outdoor injection drug use, in particular.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In January, a &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/02/10/science/boston-rat-population-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/02/10/science/boston-rat-population-climate-change/"&gt;study published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Science showed that the rat population in Boston &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ads6782" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ads6782"&gt;increased by 53 percent between 2011 and 2021&lt;/a&gt;, likely due to warming temperatures extending their foraging and breeding period. As climate change continues to intensify, so will the spread of disease, Rosenbaum said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Ariana Eggleston, the director of rat education for the &lt;a href="https://www.ratcityartsfestival.com/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.ratcityartsfestival.com/"&gt;Rat City Arts Festival&lt;/a&gt;, an annual Allston music festival that raises awareness about the neighborhood’s large rodent population, said the results of the study are “very worrying.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Not only do you have to be careful, you also have to make sure your dog’s feet are clean, you have to be hypervigilant,” Eggleston said, adding that many residents are “exhausted” from mitigating their risk of catching other infectious diseases like &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/05/metro/can-bird-flu-kill-humans-massachusetts/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/05/metro/can-bird-flu-kill-humans-massachusetts/"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; and COVID-19.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Eggleston said a lot of her work with the festival revolves around educating people in Allston-Brighton — &lt;a href="https://www.ratcityartsfestival.com/why-rat-city" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.ratcityartsfestival.com/why-rat-city"&gt;dubbed “Rat City”&lt;/a&gt; — about the importance of reporting broken trash cans, overflowing bins,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;and other items that can attract rats. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

The strategies include &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/07/17/metro/boston-rodent-action-plan-rat-problem/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/07/17/metro/boston-rodent-action-plan-rat-problem/"&gt;getting rid of rats’ food sources&lt;/a&gt;, especially by making sure the public knows how to properly dispose of trash; targeting neighborhoods with the highest concentrations of rats, including &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/07/18/boston-launches-new-rat-plan-using-recommendations-from-leading-expert/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/07/18/boston-launches-new-rat-plan-using-recommendations-from-leading-expert/"&gt;downtown, Chinatown, and Allston/Brighton&lt;/a&gt;; and using technology to more aggressively seek out and get rid of their hiding places and escape routes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“There’s a huge need for a concerted effort to sanitation,” Rosenbaum said, adding officials should focus on areas where humans have the most interactions with rodents. “And ultimately, if we restrict their access to food and water, they won’t be able to reproduce, and that will manage their populations.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dave Wagner, co-senior author of the study and executive director of the Pathogen and Microbiome Institute at Northern Arizona University, said establishing that local rat populations have their own strains of the disease could improve mitigation techniques. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Using information about distinct strains and populations, researchers tracked several rats that had migrated to other colonies, bringing their local strain of leptospirosis with them. That could mean common disruptions to rat populations, including construction, may lead to “intermingling of rat populations” and increased, not decreased, leptospirosis spread, Rosenbaum said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We need to start shifting our approach from, ‘Let’s try and kill them and eradicate them,’ to better understanding how to coexist with them. We’re not ever going to eradicate them,” Rosenbaum said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Wagner said he hopes the study, which was published in the Public Library of Science of Neglected Tropical Diseases, will help the public appreciate that the disease is becoming more prevalent worldwide. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s something we should be keeping an eye on,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

Also called borderline diabetes, the condition means your blood sugars are higher than normal, but not high enough to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diabetes UK estimates nearly 4.6 million people in the UK are diabetics and 1.3 million people could have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes. As the &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/diabetes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; notes 90% of diabetics have type 2 diabetes in the UK, it's important to recognise the signs – if any. Prediabetes is a "warning" of type 2 diabetes, as per the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21498-prediabetes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the condition can be reversed through lifestyle habits, such as exercising more or changing the way – and what – you eat. It may be possible to prevent prediabetes, or if you already have prediabetes, it's important to know what can help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;section data-embed-group="read-more" data-embed-items="2" data-ad-dockable="true" data-redesign-embed="true"&gt; &lt;aside class="read-more-links" data-mod="readMoreTweak" data-immediate=""&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Diabetes explain&lt;span&gt;ed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;First off, it's helpful to review the difference between the two main types of diabetes. According to the NHS:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong condition where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Type 2 diabetes is where the body does not produce enough insulin, or the body's cells do not react to insulin properly&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with prediabetes are at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but you can reduce the risk through lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Prediabetes diagnosis and symptoms&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31889981" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="author"&gt; (Image: Getty)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most people with prediabetes do not have symptoms. The condition is diagnosed from a blood test that measures blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, according to the Cleveland Clinic, the few people who experience symptoms may notice changes in their skin and eyes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Darkened skin in your armpit or back and sides of your neck (acanthosis nigricans)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Skin tags&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Eye changes that can lead to diabetes-related retinopathy&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Some people with prediabetes may already have nerve damage, which can cause tingling or numbness in the feet and hands," shared Dr Nisa Maruthur, John Hopkins Medicine's Associate Professor of Medicine, Epidemiology and Nursing explained on the academic institution's &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/diabetes/prediabetes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How to treat prediabetes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prediabetes is reversible and preventable through leading a healthier lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have prediabetes, you may be eligible for the &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; Diabetes Prevention Programme, which helps people make lasting lifestyle changes. The NHS says the programme has been shown to help prevent type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"A healthy lifestyle can slow, stop and even reverse the progress of prediabetes," explained Dr Maruthur. "This is important to realise since diabetes is serious and associated with health problems and complications that can affect your quality of life and even endanger your health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"With that in mind, your health care practitioner may consider referring you to a diabetes prevention program."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Lifestyle changes that could reverse prediabetes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="portrait" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31890114" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="author"&gt; (Image: Getty)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;To prevent prediabetes from progressing to type 2 diabetes, the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prediabetes/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355284" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, the top-ranked hospital in the US, recommends:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eat healthy foods.&lt;/b&gt; A diet high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains and olive oil is associated with a lower risk of prediabetes. Choose foods low in fat and calories and high in fibre. Eat a variety of foods to help you achieve your goals without compromising taste or nutrition.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be more active. &lt;/b&gt;Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up sugar for energy and helps the body use insulin more effectively. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous exercise.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lose excess weight.&lt;/b&gt; If you're overweight, losing just 5% to 7% of your body weight — about 14 pounds (6.4 kilograms) if you weigh 200 pounds (91 kilograms) — can significantly reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stop smoking.&lt;/b&gt; Stopping smoking can improve the way insulin works, improving your blood sugar level.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take medications as needed.&lt;/b&gt; If you're at high risk of diabetes, your health care provider might recommend metformin (Glumetza). Medications to control cholesterol and high blood pressure might also be prescribed.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nutrition.org.uk/health-conditions/type-2-diabetes-and-nutrition/prediabetes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;British Nutrition Foundation&lt;/a&gt; recommends the following diet tips to protect against type 2 diabetes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Eat fewer sugary foods&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Limit sugary drinks&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Eat more vegetables and fruits&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Choose high fibre carbs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Include some dairy&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cut down on red and processed meats&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 08:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxQb19pRER1Nnh3ck1kaUdHTWJUeVFVNnQxcnJrbnFhMFV2ekpraG9sa0MzSWtucXgxYUJpMG0yaTIyMk1zUV8xSW55Q25YTzNRV2VMLUV6YVRzdTlzVThWMFVpMW9mNW9SSlpLeVB5cXJIMUtLMWd4SHBNalpodklrV2g1TElNZzZnSEhVVQ</guid></item><item><title>MAHA儿童健康报告误引了我们的研究。这是草率的—和令人担忧的-统计 | The MAHA children’s health report mis-cited our research.

Barnum, American showman and circus master, famously said, “There’s no such thing as bad publicity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Or did he?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href="https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/there-is-no-such-thing-as-bad-publicity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;no definitive evidence&lt;/a&gt; that Barnum was the actual source.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But why did we ask? Well, that just came naturally to us, two old medical academics.  Thanks to our training and our work as writers, researchers, and teachers, we know that it is good to think twice about claims and their veracity. This matters less when the stakes are low, like the P.T. Barnum quip, but it matters a lot when the stakes are high — for example, important health policy claims that might affect millions of people, such as those in the recent &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/maha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;MAHA Report&lt;/a&gt;. Citations bolster research reliability because they put claims in the context of prior work and facilitate verification by pointing to sources. And AI agrees. When we asked CoPilot “Do citations matter in writing about science?” it said, yes, “they’re the backbone of academic integrity—without them, science wouldn’t progress in a structured, credible way!” Of course, asking AI is hardly the ideal way to check citations (spoiler alert).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In our little academic world, being cited is gratifying. It means someone actually read something we wrote, found it useful, and chose to build on it. So, we were both intrigued learning that two of our papers were cited in the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/maha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;MAHA report&lt;/a&gt;. Being cited in a major government publication is not just recognition, it’s also publicity. But in this case, not good publicity. Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last week, both of us received calls from journalists about citations in the MAHA report. Kravitz was asked if he knew about a publication cited in the MAHA report (footnote No. 520) meant to support the claim that “more studies on direct-to-consumer television advertisements are directed to adults” than to children. The problem was that the cited paper did not exist. But the clever journalist was able to trace the phony citation to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11056603/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;real paper&lt;/a&gt; Kravitz wrote years before. The citation (since corrected) was supposedly published in the Lancet, a prestigious medical journal whose editorial gates Kravitz long aspired to breech. But it wasn’t. Worse, from the standpoint of ego (always an issue in academia), the paper was attributed to a different author. Most importantly, it did not directly address the claim it was used to corroborate.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Woloshin got a call from a journalist inquiring about his New England Journal of Medicine article, cited in the MAHA report (No. 519). The journalist asked if it was ironic that the report cited a journal Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  recently &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/27/rfk-jr-says-medical-journals-corrupt-so-nih-may-publish-in-house/"&gt;trashed&lt;/a&gt; as unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course it was ironic. But it was also wrong. The &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16597175/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; was published in a different (alas, less prestigious) journal in a different year and, most importantly, on the wrong subject. The citation, used to substantiate a claim about TV drug ads, was actually about print journalists’ coverage of disease awareness campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These errors were just two among many cited by the nonprofit outlet &lt;a href="https://www.notus.org/health-science/make-america-healthy-again-report-citation-errors" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;NOTUS&lt;/a&gt;. For example, the MAHA report cited a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2016-4146" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; about Texas children covered by Medicaid but used it to support a claim about all 50 states. Another claim, that stopping “antidepressants, stimulants, antipsychotics, and other psychiatric drugs … often leads to disabling and pronged physical dependence … and withdrawal,” was &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36513909/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;not supported by its citation&lt;/a&gt;, a review only about antidepressants and not focused on children. Four other citations were to &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/may/30/MAHA-report-AI-fake-citations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;nonexistent papers&lt;/a&gt;. Some believe these errors occurred because MAHA report authors may have relied on an AI agent to find citations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt minimized these (and other) errors in the Report as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTmFjM-T85w" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;“some [minor] formatting issues.” &lt;/a&gt; But that is wrong. This is sloppy work which undermines faith in the whole report. A government report meant to influence the lives of millions of Americans should be thoroughly vetted and based on the most reliable sources. The government has reissued the report, but problems remain: The citation to Kravitz has been partially corrected, while Woloshin’s is unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientific and technological successes of the past century come in part from a culture that respects prior work and endeavors to get the facts right. The process isn’t perfect. As we and others have noted, scientific integrity remains under threat from predatory journals, &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard-Kravitz-2/publication/43131813_Editorial_Peer_Reviewers'_Recommendations_at_a_General_Medical_Journal_Are_They_Reliable_and_Do_Editors_Care/links/09e415134d695c3e8b000000/Editorial-Peer-Reviewers-Recommendatio" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;porous peer review&lt;/a&gt;, poor results reproducibility, and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJM199907223410411" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; scientific crimes and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1702463/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;misdemeanors&lt;/a&gt;. But it is undeniable that journals have made great progress in the last decades — for example, by creating standards for conflict of interest disclosure, pre-registration of randomized trial protocols (to prevent changing methods and outcomes after the fact), and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJM199907223410411" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;publishing&lt;/a&gt; papers &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2821293" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;critical &lt;/a&gt;of the journals when their efforts fall short.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In contrast, given the Trump administration’s recent actions — such as agency closures, grant cancellations, and layoffs of technical experts — the errors in the MAHA report reinforce serious concerns about its dedication to rigorous inquiry and factual accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How could the MAHA authors have done better? &lt;a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/shares/WAa5Ew9Cz64HDPoiqVktK" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;We asked AI&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I have to write a report to outline the leading drivers of childhood disease. Please suggest some basic principles for if and how to use and cite the research literature.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI was happy to oblige.  Here are the top 3 “key principles for using and citing research literature in your report:”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;1. “Prioritize studies from reputable journals to ensure accuracy and credibility in your report.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2. “Reference original studies directly rather than relying on summaries or secondary interpretations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;3. “Select literature that directly applies to childhood disease to maintain focus and avoid misrepresenation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The post ended with general advice and an offer of help:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This concise approach keeps the most important guidelines front and center while ensuring your report maintains integrity.  Would you like help incorporating these principles into a draft section of your report?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Great answer. And funny. But also, given the stakes, very sad.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steven Woloshin, M.D., M.S., is professor of medicine at the Geisel School of Medicine’s Dartmouth Institute. He is an unpaid member of the editorial boards of JAMA Internal Medicine and the International Congress on Peer Review and Scientific Publication —&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;the views expressed here are his own. Richard L. Kravitz, M.D., M.S.P.H., is a distinguished professor at the UC-Davis Department of Internal Medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The nimbus is now responsible for 37% of all coronavirus samples detected. California has been under threat by this subvariant ever since May and now comprises 55% of cases detected in the state as per the state Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Before Omicron, I think most people presented with the usual loss of taste and smell as the predominant symptom and shortness of breath,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious-disease expert to the LA Times. But due to the “razor blade throat” effect of the Nimbus subvariant, attention has now been diverted to “other aspects of these symptoms”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Wastewater surveillance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevated levels of coronavirus have been detected in the state’s wastewater as per noted professionals and may be contributing to the spike in cases. Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, regional chief of infectious diseases for Kaiser Permanente Southern California, wrote in an email to The Times, “Wastewater surveillance across Southern California shows variability: Santa Barbara watersheds are reporting moderate-to-high levels, Ventura and Los Angeles counties are seeing low-to-moderate levels, Riverside is reporting low levels, while San Bernardino is experiencing high activity.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The state Department of Public Health says that viral levels in wastewater have risen by 13% for the ten-day period concluded on May 30 which proves why more positive cases of the virus have started to appear in the city. As per its official website, coronavirus levels across California continue to remain at a “medium” scale.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coronavirus levels in Santa Clara County have started to rise over the summer while the levels in the sewershed of San José are considered to be high. Palo Alto records “medium” levels and Sunnyvale reports “low”. San Francisco, on the other hand, still has a relatively lower number of cases being reported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO READ|&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/what-is-razor-blade-throat-new-covid-variant-nimbus-in-us-causing-very-painful-symptom-know-about-prevention-101750240798218.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="What is razor blade throat?

Experts recommend incorporating specific foods—such as turmeric, lime, apple cider vinegar, green tea, and papaya—into daily meals to support liver health.	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div class="fck_detail"&gt;
&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;According to Dr. Nguyen Anh Tuan, Head of the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery at Central Military Hospital 108, the liver is considered fatty when fat accounts for more than 5–10% of its total weight. This buildup makes the liver more prone to damage and can lead to inflammation, fibrosis, or even liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Dr. Tuan emphasized that dietary and lifestyle changes can significantly improve the condition.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Lime&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Limes are rich in vitamin C, a natural antioxidant that boosts the liver’s production of glutathione, a key compound for detoxification. They also contain naringenin, which has been shown to reduce liver inflammation due to fatty liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Apple cider vinegar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Widely regarded as a natural remedy for fatty liver, &lt;a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/life/wellness/7-drinks-to-detox-liver-4891809.html" rel="dofollow"&gt;apple cider vinegar&lt;/a&gt; may aid in weight loss and help reduce fat storage in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Green tea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/life/wellness/3-best-herbal-teas-to-support-kidney-health-4897201.html" rel="dofollow"&gt;Green tea&lt;/a&gt;, rich in antioxidants and essential nutrients, supports fat burning and may help reduce the risk of fatty liver disease, especially non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Dandelion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Dandelion is traditionally used as a liver tonic. It supports fat breakdown and helps activate liver function, making it particularly effective for individuals with NAFLD related to obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Papaya&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Papaya and its seeds are believed to aid in healing liver damage, including fibrosis. The fruit helps burn fat in the liver and is considered beneficial for managing fatty liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Dr. Tuan advises patients to monitor their weight and limit fat intake to reduce liver fat levels. For those who are overweight or obese, gradual weight loss is key to improving liver function and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="true" data-component-type="tin_xemthem" data-component-value="4903033,4899210,4894666,4903513,4898192,4897201" data-thumb="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Dementia is a degenerative brain condition leading to diminished cognitive abilities, encompassing memory and rational skills, as well as speech and emotional response over time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than 944,000 individuals in the UK are afflicted with dementia, with one in 11 people over 65 being affected. This figure is on the rise due to increased longevity amongst the population.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although an absolute cure remains elusive, prompt diagnosis of dementia is imperative to establish a treatment regime and medications to manage symptoms more effectively. Dr Johannes Uys of Broadgate General Practice pinpointed several precursory indicators that might suggest the advent of dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While dementia is commonly associated with failing memory, Dr Uys indicates that physical symptoms may precede memory deterioration in certain cases. He identifies four initial signs to be vigilant about, often connected to specific dementia types like Parkinson's disease dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The specialist further stressed that the manifestation of symptoms is individual, considering each person's unique experience with dementia. "However, if you notice any of these early signs in yourself or a loved one, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation. Early detection and intervention can help manage symptoms and provide the necessary support", he concluded, reports &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/four-early-signs-dementia-appear-30272065" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;Surrey Live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dementia risk factors are a mixed bag, with some being unavoidable like age, while others can be managed through lifestyle modifications in our younger years. Regular exercise and a balanced diet are known to lower the risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other beneficial changes include maintaining a healthy weight, quitting smoking, reducing alcohol consumption and cholesterol levels. The &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; suggests that cutting down on saturated fats, salt, and sugar, and increasing fibre intake could also help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;The GP went on to share these four early signs to look out for:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;an unsteady gait&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;clumsiness&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;difficulty with coordination&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;tremors or stiffness in the limbs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early diagnosis of dementia allows for prompt support to patients. However, a recent Alzheimer's Society survey reveals that only one in three people consult a doctor within the first month of noticing dementia symptoms in themselves or a loved one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A poll involving 1,100 individuals showed that most people hesitate to seek help due to uncertainty about whether the symptoms are related to the condition or just signs of ageing. It's crucial to remember that dementia is not a natural part of ageing, and if you're becoming increasingly forgetful, especially if you're over 65, it's advisable to consult your GP.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts predict that by 2050, a staggering 150 million people worldwide will be affected by the condition, according to research published in the Lancet Public Health. Currently, around 900,000 people in the UK are living with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 06:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQcUhRS1ZLSk9WNlNRZmRjQWJUWXlQVDNIOHBvOHZodjh2Z0ZLaGtWV0pFQTBRcHJaZ0hPRnp6NEt3ZHFtQUxVT0NuOHREWGhtY3VRU0VybzFKY1ZJODdIVjVDLUV3bEpEYTdBYWVXU2dmV0sySEQ3T25nODJRQ3VjaGpqYTdCYWZn0gGOAUFVX3lxTE54LTN5dWd1cXpqcjdFcDRCQzJhbGQzMm9Vdkp3N3JwVGYyeWhnZmt6emdEd25lSjYzUERLQ1B0dFFsbHNUVFplU1pkTmZLUkNPSVZ0OWN6MWhqOVVoTlFIdzEybThmVVVrejVaaXJhZU9Ba216aS1HRWtIVE8tUTNfLUFtNXBEVGp4ZUVOb2c</guid></item><item><title>通过简单的血液测试，可以在症状出现前3年检测到癌症；新研究显示-印度时报 | Cancer could be detected 3 years before symptoms appear with a simple blood test; new study reveals - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAJBVV95cUxOM0psN09ldWJ5YXNfSjBXZmpuaUFsQnlLUFZRQXV5VVRqYzI3cURlbGFaWXFtTGF6RXQ2YUctZTh3QTFCWmVseHg2cUdGeFVTbmFlNWNHZXdTTV9GRldybGRST2NodzJteFlKMkNhcnEyUV95X0RuNjBhR0N5eVBQSEJ3QU1iUExKbm5HUHdqM0lCdmJyb3JQSmV5VUxabmdudDQ4WkJaS010Vl9fLWg5U0dpSXF6RThwXzBHSjFmNlo4X19UY2dBSGJkeU4xU1F2NG5QQ3BNYlhTazZudWRZOVZ1Y2NYOERyeHZQNXd1bnVhVlRiaTFwNGVBY3dGRFp6dkFXZEI0MnQtVVkyaUVMZDZyYVdGem5HSm5zM25tVFRGb1dp?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the leading causes of death in recent years, cancer, is claiming to take millions of lives each year. Despite the significant advancements in the treatment, the biggest challenge in fighting cancer is that the detection is often too late. Detecting cancer earlier may dramatically improve survival rates and offer more treatment options. But, this is yet harder to diagnose at the earliest stage and is one of the crucial reasons for rising deaths worldwide. Now, a new study by Johns Hopkins University researchers suggests that a simple blood test could help identify cancer years before symptoms even begin to show, potentially transforming the future of early diagnosis and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study published in the peer-reviewed journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article-abstract/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-25-0375/762609/Detection-of-cancers-three-years-prior-to" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cancer Discovery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, this breakthrough might be a push in early diagnosis of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A simple blood test may detect cancer early, before any symptoms start&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer outcomes are heavily dependent on how early the disease is detected. When tumours are caught in their initial stages, they tend to be smaller, less aggressive, and more responsive to treatment. As researcher Yuxuan Wang from Johns Hopkins explains, “Three years earlier provides time for intervention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tumours are likely to be much less advanced and more likely to be curable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time advantage could make the difference between curable and life-threatening cancer, especially in aggressive forms of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the research is a type of genetic material called circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA). Tumours naturally shed fragments of their DNA into the bloodstream, but these traces are extremely minute and hard to detect, especially in the early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Science behind detecting cancer in blood&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify these fragments, scientists used multi-step algorithms and cross-checks to scan blood samples for modifications in DNA patterns that are commonly linked to tumours. The technique forms the basis of a Multi-Cancer Early Detection (MCED) test, designed to look for cancer-specific genetic changes in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team analysed blood samples from 52 individuals, split into two groups:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;26 people who were later diagnosed with cancer within six months of sample collection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;26 people who remained cancer-free.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When subjected to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/screening/multi-cancer-early-detection-tests.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;MCED test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, eight cancer cases were flagged, indicating a 31% detection rate. While not perfect, this detection occurred before any formal diagnosis or visible symptoms appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Testing the method: What the study revealed&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes the findings even more groundbreaking is the analysis of older blood samples from some of the participants. Six of the eight individuals who were detected by the MCED test had blood samples available from 3.1 to 3.5 years before their diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, cancer signals were found in four of those six samples. The ctDNA was present, although at levels up to 80 times lower than what the current test threshold requires. This suggests that tumours begin shedding DNA into the blood long before symptoms arise. if the tests are sensitive enough, these early signs could be caught. While the results are promising, they also highlight a key hurdle that the current technology needs to improve its sensitivity. The earlier the stage of cancer, the lower the ctDNA levels, making detection difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study shows the promise of MCED tests in detecting cancers very early,” says Dr. Bert Vogelstein, a senior cancer researcher involved in the project. “But it also sets the benchmark sensitivities required for these tests to succeed.” In simpler terms, we now know what we should aim for—but we’re not quite there yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What happens after a positive cancer blood test&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the science is encouraging, moving from lab to the clinic is not straightforward. Blood-based cancer screening tests must undergo rigorous clinical trials to prove their reliability and safety. Once proven effective, they still require regulatory approvals before being adopted into regular medical practice. There's also the question of what comes after a positive test. Dr. Nickolas Papadopoulos from the Ludwig Centre notes, “We need to determine the appropriate clinical follow-up after a positive test result. That includes further scans, biopsies, or even preventive treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the current limitations, this research represents a hopeful shift in cancer diagnostics.

These drugs are known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1"&gt;glucagon-like peptide-1&lt;/a&gt; (GLP-1) receptor agonists, because of the way they mimic the natural GLP-1 hormone, which &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-reshapes-the-kinds-of-food-people-eat-heres-what-happens"&gt;controls appetite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using health records, the team matched people who had taken one of the weight loss drugs with people who had undergone either of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatric_surgery"&gt;bariatric surgery&lt;/a&gt; operations, based on age, body mass index, and blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165321" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165321" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-642x428.jpg" alt="Ozempic Isn't Actually The Most Effective Option For Weight Loss, Scientists Confirm" class="wp-image-165321 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165321" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(aprott/iStock/Getty Images Plus)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line: people in the surgery group shed an average of 25.7 percent of their total body weight over two years, while those in the medication group lost 5.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's partly down to patients not sticking to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-vs-supplements-dietitian-reveals-truth-about-glp-1-imitations"&gt;their GLP-1 drugs&lt;/a&gt;, whereas surgery is more permanent, but the researchers also noticed smaller differences over shorter time frames – the surgery always gave the best results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials"&gt;Clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; show weight loss between 15 percent to 21 percent for GLP-1s, but this study suggests that weight loss in the real world is considerably lower even for patients who have active prescriptions for an entire year," &lt;a href="https://asmbs.org/news_releases/head-to-head-study-shows-bariatric-surgery-superior-to-glp-1-drugs-for-weight-loss/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Avery Brown, a surgical resident at NYU Langone Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know as many as 70 percent of patients may discontinue treatment within one year. GLP-1 patients may need to adjust their expectations, adhere more closely to treatment or opt for metabolic and bariatric surgery to achieve desired results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting, however, that the study was funded by the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS), who would have a vested interest in promoting surgical options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, the researchers aren't outright dismissing semaglutide treatments, which also showed beneficial results in this study. With &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-coverage-of-and-spending-on-glp-1s/"&gt;GLP-1 prescriptions doubling&lt;/a&gt; from 2022 to 2023, it's crucial to investigate how they compare to established &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/as-well-as-weight-loss-studies-find-bariatric-surgery-also-lowers-the-risk-of-developing-cancer"&gt;surgery methods&lt;/a&gt;, and to figure out which options are best for each individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs remain much more popular than surgery, but people &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.57349"&gt;don't often&lt;/a&gt; stick to taking them. Meanwhile, only a small percentage of people eligible for surgery choose it as an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight loss isn't the only benefit that can come from Ozempic. The drug was originally approved as a way to treat type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="165259" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, because it helps lower blood sugar levels, and studies have shown it can also reduce &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-and-similar-drugs-lower-cancer-risks-study-suggests"&gt;the risk of cancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-could-be-good-for-your-heart-even-if-you-dont-lose-weight"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;. In this study, bariatric surgery was associated with even better blood sugar control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to note that surgery isn't a silver bullet either. Though safe, the procedures are invasive, permanent, and still require patients to stick to strict diet and exercise routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In future studies we will aim to identify what healthcare providers can do to optimize GLP-1 outcomes, identify which patients are better treated with bariatric surgery versus GLP-1s, and determine the role out-of-pocket costs play in treatment success," &lt;a href="https://asmbs.org/news_releases/head-to-head-study-shows-bariatric-surgery-superior-to-glp-1-drugs-for-weight-loss/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Karan Chhabra, a bariatric surgeon at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2025.04.008"&gt;was presented&lt;/a&gt; at the ASMBS annual meeting 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Working out can be a great way to protect your brain health—and new research suggests &lt;strong&gt;you don’t necessarily need to “go hard or go home” to see benefits.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to a large review first published in &lt;em&gt;The British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/em&gt; this past spring, all kinds of exercise—regardless of intensity level—can significantly boost brain health for all ages.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In particular, &lt;strong&gt;moderate-intensity exercise&lt;/strong&gt; led to the most significant results for &lt;strong&gt;memory&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;executive function &lt;/strong&gt;(like problem solving and reasoning).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Low-intensity exercise&lt;/strong&gt; was most beneficial for &lt;strong&gt;general cognition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers also studied specific activities and found that &lt;strong&gt;active video games known as “exergames”&lt;/strong&gt; delivered the most significant cognitive benefits, followed by &lt;strong&gt;mind-body activities such as yoga and Tai Chi.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s what experts had to say about the new study, plus &lt;strong&gt;how to incorporate these three exercises&lt;/strong&gt; into your fitness routine for the&lt;strong&gt; maximum brain boost.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-kind-of-exercise-boosts-brain-function"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this study, researchers analyzed findings from 133 reviews that included over 258,000 participants.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Looking for patterns across the various reports, the researchers found “strong evidence that &lt;strong&gt;exercise improves general cognition, memory, and executive function across all age groups,” &lt;/strong&gt;said lead study author &lt;a href="https://people.unisa.edu.au/Ben.Singh" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Ben Singh, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, postdoctoral researcher in population and digital health at the University of South Australia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The benefits were especially noticeable for children, adolescents, and people with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.health.com/adhd-overview-7187317" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; (ADHD), Singh told &lt;em&gt;Health&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other exercise factors that impacted brain health included:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intensity. &lt;/strong&gt;Low- to moderate-intensity exercise had a slightly stronger association with brain health than vigorous or high-intensity exercise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intervention time. &lt;/strong&gt;Committing to an exercise routine for even a short period of time (one to three months) was beneficial, particularly for general cognition. However, longer interventions were helpful for other aspects of brain health, too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Activity type. &lt;/strong&gt;Exergames—video games that require physical movement—had the biggest effects on cognition and memory. Yoga, Tai Chi, or other exercises that require people to remember coordinated movement sequences were also particularly beneficial for memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “These findings reinforce the&lt;strong&gt; importance of incorporating even light physical activity into daily life&lt;/strong&gt; as part of a long-term strategy for maintaining brain health,” said Singh.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-best-exercises-for-brain-healthand-how-to-do-them"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This latest study is &lt;strong&gt;just a jumping off point,&lt;/strong&gt; Singh said—evidence quality varied, exercise protocols across studies weren’t consistent, and most reports only looked at short-term cognitive benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, this is yet another piece of evidence that &lt;strong&gt;moving more is good for your brain—and yoga, Tai Chi, and exergames could be especially effective ways to do it.&lt;/strong&gt; Here’s what to know about each type of exercise.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; ​&lt;a href="https://www.health.com/yoga-8715089" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Yoga&lt;/a&gt; is an ancient practice that combines &lt;strong&gt;physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation,&lt;/strong&gt; said &lt;a href="https://www.drannaemanuel.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Anna Emanuel, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an integrative and functional medicine physician, yoga teacher, and founder of Love.Life Medical. This combination creates unique cognitive engagement that can improve brain health, Singh explained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yoga can help &lt;strong&gt;reduce stress and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/inflammation-7480642" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; in turn supporting “hippocampal function, the brain’s center for memory,” he said.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It also strengthens the prefrontal cortex, the brain region responsible for decision-making, planning, and emotional regulation,” Singh said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So what’s the best way to get started with yoga (and reap its brain health benefits)? Start with &lt;strong&gt;short sessions—maybe 20 to 30 minutes, two or three times a week,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ascendantny.com/contributors/michael-genovese/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Michael Genovese, MD, JD&lt;/a&gt;, physician and chief medical advisor at Ascendant New York, told &lt;em&gt;Health&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Try styles such as &lt;strong&gt;Hatha or Vinyasa yoga, &lt;/strong&gt;which blend gentle movement with breathwork, Genovese recommended.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And since &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.health.com/stress-management-8551051" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stress reduction&lt;/a&gt; is good for your brain, end each yoga session with meditation or a relaxation technique, added Singh.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Following structured yoga programs specifically designed for brain health or mindfulness can further amplify the cognitive benefits,” he said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/tai-chi-memory-parkinsons-disease-8407135" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Tai Chi&lt;/a&gt; is a traditional Chinese martial art that &lt;strong&gt;combines slow movements and deep breathing&lt;/strong&gt; to intentionally balance energy through the body, Emauel told &lt;em&gt;Health&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Often described as ‘moving meditation,’ the sequence of movements aim to slow down the mind, body, and breath,” she explained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tai Chi promotes cognitive health more effectively than other exercises because it focuses on &lt;strong&gt;slow, purposeful movements that connect the body and mind,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.comprehendthemind.com/team/dr-sanam-hafeez" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sanam Hafeez, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, a neuropsychologist and director of Comprehend the Mind, told &lt;em&gt;Health&lt;/em&gt;. This “activates brain regions responsible for &lt;strong&gt;memory and motor functions&lt;/strong&gt;,” she said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People who practice Tai Chi also have to &lt;strong&gt;remember a specific set of movements,&lt;/strong&gt; which challenges memory, added Genovese.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And like yoga, the practice “&lt;strong&gt;lowers stress,&lt;/strong&gt; which usually means better focus and mental clarity,” he said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For the greatest cognitive benefits, practice Tai Chi at least &lt;strong&gt;three times per week for 20 to 60 minutes&lt;/strong&gt; per session, Singh said, ideally with a group.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Engaging in structured routines, such as the Yang or Chen styles, can be particularly effective, as they require memorization,” he said. “Focusing on controlled breathing and mindfulness during practice further enhances cognitive engagement.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Exergames are &lt;strong&gt;video games that require physical activity&lt;/strong&gt; to interact with the game, making exercise both engaging and cognitively stimulating, Singh explained.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Per Singh, examples include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_67-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nintendo Wii Sports,&lt;/strong&gt; which features games such as tennis and boxing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dance Dance Revolution,&lt;/strong&gt; a step-based rhythm game&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtual reality fitness games,&lt;/strong&gt; including Beat Saber, Supernatural, and FitXR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_68-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_69-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “You are reacting quickly, following patterns, and solving challenges—all while physically active,” Genovese said. “This kind of multitasking can &lt;strong&gt;help sharpen attention, coordination, and memory.”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_70-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_71-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On top of that, the highly interactive and gamified nature of exergames &lt;strong&gt;keeps you motivated,&lt;/strong&gt; leading to more consistent participation and cognitive benefits over time, Singh explained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_72-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_73-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To maximize cognitive benefits, choose exergames that involve complex movements and decision-making, like &lt;strong&gt;rhythm-based or sports simulation games,&lt;/strong&gt; Singh said. Play for at least &lt;strong&gt;20 to 30 minutes, three to five times per week.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_74-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_75-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not only should you pick games that challenge you mentally and physically, but you should also pick ones you find fun. “The more you enjoy it, the more likely you are to stick with it—and that is where the real benefits come in,” Genovese said.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
