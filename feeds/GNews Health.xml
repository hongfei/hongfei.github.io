A bit farther back was the offending bump, large and nearly brushing the inside of her teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her dentist insisted that whatever it was, it &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14786545/Womans-mouth-cancer-deadly-common-infection.html"&gt;would go away with time&lt;/a&gt;. Thirty-six at the time, fit, healthy, and a nonsmoker, Powell was not a high risk for &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-f75ea270-618e-11f0-a87f-05a3c163b258"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. But weeks passed, and the bump remained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Powell went to an urgent care clinic in January 2020, where the doctor referred her to an ear, nose, and throat specialist, who performed a biopsy of the bump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A week went by in silence until Powell got the news that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14654813/Common-mouth-problem-warning-sign-cancer-tongue-removed.html"&gt;the bump was cancerous&lt;/a&gt;, and it had spread to her lymph nodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her diagnosis kicked off what she considers to be the most 'morbid' period of her life, starting with a tongue resection surgery and 30 grueling radiation treatments that she often wished she could quit early because the pain was so great. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tongue cancer accounts for less than one percent of all new cancer cases in the US every year. Around 20,000 cases and 3,200 deaths are confirmed annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Thirty-six at the time, fit, healthy, and a nonsmoker, Jamie Powell was not a high risk for cancer. Neither she nor her dentist could believe that the obtrusive bump on the side of her tongue could be a cancerous mass&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the rate of deaths due to tongue cancer has remained about the same for about two decades, the patient profile of new cases of tongue cancer is beginning to shift from primarily older male smokers to women and younger healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oral cancers usually spread quickly if left untreated, and Powell is confident that hers was allowed to grow unchecked when she was sent home from her dentist’s office over five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It was scary and frustrating not to know what was going on and not having anyone listen to me,’ she told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://people.com/cancer-survivor-reflects-on-life-five-years-after-tongue-surgery-11768664"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Powell had a section of her tongue surgically removed on March 23, 2020, just as Covid was getting its grip on the world. Doctors reconstructed it using tissue taken from her thigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I remember the surgeon describing the surgery to me. I was just numb, and I heard him say that my voice will be different,’ she said. ‘I instantly thought of my kids. How will I sing to them? How will I tell them how much I love them?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She then had all of the lymph nodes removed on her left side to stop the spread of the cancer in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I couldn’t talk or eat. I had a feeding tube and I used my iPad to communicate to the doctors and nurses,’ Powell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also had to endure six weeks of radiation treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Powell had a section of her tongue surgically removed on March 23, 2020, just as Covid was getting its grip on the world&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With her head encased in a mesh mask that is bolted to a radiation table to ensure complete stillness, Powell suffered sunburn-like charred skin on her neck, blisters on her lips, and painful ulcers in her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Off the table, she was fatigued, nauseous, and had lost her sense of taste, so everything tasted of either wet cardboard or sewage. She also no longer had working salivary glands, resulting in a constant dry mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’d rather do surgery every single day than go through head and neck radiation again,’ Jamie, now 41, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jamieraepowell/video/7060165809494281519"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She lost her ability to speak by week three of radiation, her mouth essentially one big canker sore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After surgery, she had to retrain her brain to form sounds and piece them into words. She still has trouble with words starting with ‘sh’ and ‘ch’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating without salivary glands requires her to sip water after every bite. And if she has a dinner date with friends, she has to decide ahead of time whether she will eat or talk. She can no longer do both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At bedtime, she does not recline. Instead, she sits back as if in an airplane seat, propped against acupressure pillows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Think about when you’re sleeping and you wake up and your mouth is dry. I have that 24/7, and it’s heightened to the next exponent at night. So I have to sleep sitting up no matter what,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Radiation treatments led to irritated sun burned-like skin on her neck, sores in her mouth, and blisters around her lips&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And I wake up every hour from choking because of the dry mouth, so I take a drink of water, and I also have a spray bottle, and I will spray the inside of my mouth, like how you water your house plant.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every morning, at four am, she has to pry her jaw open with both hands and use the handle of a spoon to prop her mouth open so that she can stretch it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘For months after radiation, I couldn’t taste anything, then one morning I made my coffee and I could actually taste it - I cried,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Powell began documenting her experience on TikTok when she realized there were no other creators like her on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tongue cancer is rare, but federal tracking indicates it is becoming more common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rates of new cases have risen &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/tongue.html"&gt;about 49 percent&lt;/a&gt; since 1992, according to the National Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases are becoming increasingly common in women and young people, which scientists believe are tied to human papillomavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 70 percent of oropharyngeal cancers affecting the tonsils, base of the tongue, soft palate, and throat are linked to HPV, yet only 61 percent of US teens are fully vaccinated against the virus, which requires two or three doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The death rate due to tongue cancer has remained steady for decades, but case rates are ticking up in part, scientists believe, due to human papillomavirus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 42 million Americans carry HPV, a virus that causes genital warts and cancers like cervical, throat, and anal malignancies, with 47,000 new HPV-related cancer cases diagnosed yearly. Despite this, public awareness of HPV’s cancer risks is declining, even as vaccination remains a critical defense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Most oral cancers are missed until it’s in the later stages,’ Powell said. ‘I’ve learned that no one should go through this alone. The more we talk about this cancer, the more help we can be to one another.’&lt;/p&gt;

Some doctors and medical practices are &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2024/cancer-blood-test-screening/"&gt;already using them&lt;/a&gt;, and the field has been propelled forward by innovation and hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MAJXNMQ4NZAOVDMEBB5UO2R24E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Turning these innovative technologies into usable medical tools for the broader population has been complex. But a study recruiting subjects this summer, funded by the National Cancer Institute, seeks to begin to do that by answering basic questions about how the tests perform in comparison to more conventional cancer screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="YV2Z45NXYZELHJLBBYTJ5ANALY" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="YV2Z45NXYZELHJLBBYTJ5ANALY" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What will the study consider?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ECSK5LPSQBBWXNWOQOHQ5JOHSY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A screening test given to millions of healthy people has to be accurate to avoid costly and anxiety-inducing follow-ups. And for it to become part of routine medical care, there needs to be evidence that the test can reliably find cancers — perhaps far earlier than routine methods. Most importantly, scientists want to see clear evidence that earlier detection leads to longer lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QZH6ONEBMFCQBMF7JLGQZACUUQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To begin to fill this knowledge gap, scientists at nine sites around the country are recruiting up to 24,000 people between the ages of 45 and 75&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;for the &lt;a href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/institutes-networks-ircs/cancer-screening-research-network/the-vanguard-study.html"&gt;Vanguard Study&lt;/a&gt;. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either regular screening or one of two multi-cancer detection tests. All of the groups will be told to continue with regular cancer screenings and will be followed over two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XRX5WGWGIZFL7DZVFENIPK5KQI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The blood tests used in the study are made by Guardant Health and ClearNote Health. They&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;will screen for a variety of cancers, including many for which there aren’t more traditional screening tests: bladder, breast, colorectal, esophageal, stomach, liver, lung, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VZPVBKT5EFCVTFGVLZ6J6IJU7U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers, guided by what they learn from this first trial, hope to launch a much larger trial, with about 150,000 people, to definitively establish the effectiveness of these tests in preventing deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GIXSYZANJ5CZJAJCKNBIMPX4EU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Bert Vogelstein has been working on these ideas for 30 years at Johns Hopkins Medicine and is a scientific founder of Exact Sciences, a company working to make blood tests for cancer screenings, but is not involved in the new trial. He said the field is still in its adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M2N3UEEUQVE7TA2UU43HQ4FLMA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“But adolescents can do a lot of great things, that’s clear in athletics and it’s clear in science,” Vogelstein said. “I think what NCI is doing is great.

People could roll up their sleeves and get a blood test to flag 20 cancers, allowing physicians to give early treatments when they have no symptoms. That could dramatically reduce the need for people to go through years of illness and advanced cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WNLZ276BL5H3RLMB4GBRQXU7FI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“That dream, to me, is decades off, but we’re starting on it now — which is why it’s so exciting,” said Scott Ramsey, a physician and researcher at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and a principal investigator with the Cancer Screening Research Network, which will be running the Vanguard Study. “We’re not talking about treating people who are sick; we’re talking about preventing people of dying in cancer in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PGGHCYOL2NFE7IN7EG4AVPSKWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The harms of screening are not always as clear to the public, but they show the trade-offs inherent when providing a medical intervention to healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BHSPCS5OERAAJARO2P4WAWD4J4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Ramsey pointed to the history around &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/government-task-force-discourages-routine-testing-for-prostate-cancer/2012/05/21/gIQAhFMFgU_story.html"&gt;prostate specific antigen (PSA) tests&lt;/a&gt;, which identified many prostate cancers early — some of which would have never shown symptoms or caused death. That meant that many men were aggressively treated, with surgery and radiation that caused them to be incontinent or impotent for years or decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IXQ65ALXOBDGTNPTZY55VI7TMU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The recommendations on how to test for prostate cancer changed as these trends became clear over decades. Ramsey said that now is the right moment to be subjecting these cancer blood tests to scrutiny. The potential for the tests is enormous, but there are fundamental questions that need to be answered about how and when they should be used — and, perhaps, when they shouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="PYFYLWDLWBD4XM4JIEBJ7DJ5E4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="PYFYLWDLWBD4XM4JIEBJ7DJ5E4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What needs to happen next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="V6REZE437ZFLTN5WLTHUSI3TTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The  recent study in &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article-abstract/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-25-0375/763427/Detection-of-Cancers-Three-Years-prior-to" target="_blank"&gt;Cancer Discovery&lt;/a&gt; illustrated one of the major problems facing the field.

			&lt;p&gt;Copper isn't normally what comes to mind when talking about healthy eating, but a new study links copper in the diets of older adults to better cognitive function – a significant finding for research into &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coffee-could-be-the-secret-to-healthy-aging-for-women-scientists-discover"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carried out by a team from Hebei Medical University in China, the study looked at diet and health data for 2,420 adults aged 60 or over in the US, finding there was a link between more copper in diets and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-4-key-factors-that-may-predict-cognitive-decline"&gt;better cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across multiple measures, those with more copper in their diets scored significantly higher than those with less – though there was also a threshold point above which more copper doesn't seem to bring additional benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-should-eat-more-of-these-8-healthy-foods-and-heres-why?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;8 Foods You Should Actually Eat More of: A Nutritionist Explains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The current study indicates a potential association between dietary copper intake and enhanced cognitive function in American older adults, particularly among those with a history of stroke," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-09280-9"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dose–response analysis suggested an optimal copper intake level, with an inflection point of approximately 1.22 milligrams per day. However, further longitudinal studies are necessary to confirm these findings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that gets at some key limitations of the study. Participants were asked to report everything they'd eaten in the last 24 hours, on two occasions, and the scientists estimated their copper intake from that. That only gives us a snapshot in time, and introduces potential biases from self-reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate further, studies would need to follow participants over several years, and measure their copper intake more carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, we can't say there's a direct &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"&gt;cause and effect&lt;/a&gt; relationship here. However, the relationship is statistically strong enough to warrant further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167687" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167687" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/CopperChart.jpg" alt="Copper analysis" class="wp-image-167687 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/CopperChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/CopperChart-600x387.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167687" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers charted copper intake against cognition test results. (Jia et al., &lt;em&gt;Sci. Rep.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, it fits with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-022-01802-5"&gt;earlier studies&lt;/a&gt; that came to the same conclusion: copper is good for the brain. We know that it helps &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2014.00143"&gt;neuron communication&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232213850"&gt;energy production&lt;/a&gt; in the brain, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2008.09.039"&gt;protects against damage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, the study results aren't surprising. However, they do help quantify the benefits of copper across a relatively large group of older people, and several different &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-test-could-tell-if-you-have-early-signs-of-dementia-with-high-accuracy"&gt;cognitive tests&lt;/a&gt; – and identify a 'sweet spot' for copper intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Though copper is necessary for proper functioning of the brain, and deficiencies can lead to neurological disorders, excessive copper can be toxic, leading to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-09280-9"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1.22 mg per day is the equivalent of a handful of walnuts or a bowl of lentils. Copper is found in more foods &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/nutrition/copper-in-diet"&gt;than you might think&lt;/a&gt; – including mushrooms, dark chocolate, wheat bran, and oysters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15245116"&gt;an increasing amount of interest&lt;/a&gt; in micronutrients such as magnesium, iron, selenium, zinc, and copper, and how they might be important in keeping brains sharp as people enter the later years of their lives. This is on top of what studies have already discovered about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-30-year-study-may-have-found-the-single-best-diet-for-healthy-aging"&gt;diets and healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, what we eat &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-pinpointed-the-best-diets-to-boost-healthy-aging"&gt;plays a major role&lt;/a&gt; in how healthy our brains are – though diet is far from the only factor involved. Research like this can lead the way towards improvements in preventions and treatments for the brain problems that tend to come with old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the increase in the aging global aging population, the prevalence of cognitive impairment is also escalating," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-09280-9"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All forms of dementia, ranging from mild cognitive impairment to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="167684" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, are marked by cognitive decline and are increasingly emerging as a significant global public health challenge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-09280-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

While it’s easy to get immune to concerns about nutrient deficiencies, as a result, these do happen. One to have on your radar is signs of a vitamin B2 deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also known as riboflavin, vitamin B2 deficiency isn’t overly common in the U.S. However, having an underlying &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a40620724/thyroid-problems-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:thyroid issue;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;thyroid issue&lt;/a&gt;, being a vegetarian or vegan, and being pregnant or breastfeeding may raise your risk of being deficient in riboflavin, according to the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Riboflavin-HealthProfessional/#h7" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; (NIH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: Ife J.

It’s also crucial for normal cell growth and function. The &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Riboflavin-HealthProfessional/#h3" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommended daily allowance;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;recommended daily allowance&lt;/a&gt; of riboflavin is 1.1 milligrams for most adult women (that jumps to 1.4 milligrams and 1.6 milligrams when you’re pregnant and breastfeeding, respectively), and 1.3 milligrams for most adult men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, if you’re consistently falling short of that amount, you may end up dealing with uncomfortable symptoms. Vitamin B2 isn’t a nutrient most people are familiar with, and it’s fair to be unclear on what the signs of a riboflavin deficiency actually are. Here’s what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the symptoms of low vitamin B2?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some symptoms of low vitamin B2 overlap with a slew of underlying health conditions, making it tricky to say for sure if you’re dealing with a vitamin B2 deficiency or something else. But if you notice one or several of these at once, it’s worth consulting a healthcare professional for a deeper dive into your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause of fatigue is an admittedly tough thing to pin down. Have you been working out too hard? Are you getting enough iron? Is your sleep off? Or is it your vitamin B2 levels? You can develop anemia, a condition where your body doesn’t have enough healthy red blood cells, when you have too-low levels of riboflavin over a longer period of time, according to the NIH. Among other things, that can make you feel weak and fatigued. But there’s another reason why a lack of riboflavin can make you feel tired, according to Keri Gans, R.D.N., dietitian and host of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpodcasts.apple.com%2Fus%2Fpodcast%2Fthe-keri-report%2Fid1505586646&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fa65372376%2Fvitamin-b2-deficiency-symptoms%2F" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Keri Report podcast;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;The Keri Report podcast&lt;/a&gt;. “Riboflavin helps your body convert carbohydrates into fuel and plays a big role in how your cells produce energy,” she says. “Fatigue can happen when that process breaks down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cracked lips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, this may be due to something else, including not taking in enough liquids regularly. But cracked lips may also be a sign of low B2, according to Ife J. Rodney, M.D., a dermatologist and founding director of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://eternaldermatology.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Riboflavin helps with moisture retention,” she says. If you’re low in the nutrient, your lips’ natural moisture can suffer as a result, leading to cracking and even bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crusty corners of the mouth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a more unique symptom of riboflavin deficiency, leading to lesions at the corners of your mouth. “You may get scaling or cracking in the corners of the mouth,” Dr. Rodney says. (This may even show up in the corners of your mouth and ears, she adds.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scaly patches on your skin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scaly patches can be a symptom of several skin conditions, but they may also be due to a lack of B2. “Riboflavin helps with tissue repair and cell turnover,” Dr. Rodney explains. “Any time you have issues with tissue repair or cell turnover, that’s when you get cracking or scaling.” These scaly patches will often look red or discolored from your usual skin color, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sore throat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riboflavin deficiency may cause swelling in your mouth and throat, making it feel like you have a sore throat, according to the NIH. “Since riboflavin is also crucial for overall cell function, low levels can affect fast-healing areas like the skin and mouth, leading to symptoms like a sore throat,” Gans says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexplained hair loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;That cell turnover that can impact the health of your lips and skin may also affect your hair, Dr. Rodney says. When you don’t have enough riboflavin, it can impact the production of collagen, a type of protein that supports hair follicle (and skin) health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reproductive issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fertility is incredibly complicated, and it’s hard to say that adding more B2 to your diet will magically help you conceive. But not having enough riboflavin can interfere with several areas of reproduction, including the development of sperm and eggs, and ovulation, along with early development of the embryo, says &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://askdrgreves.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Christine Greves, M.D.;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christine Greves, M.D.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ob/gyn at the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies in Orlando, Fla. (Worth noting: Many prenatal vitamins contain riboflavin.) Still, this isn’t usually a go-to solution for doctors when you’re struggling to conceive. “I don’t ask someone when they’re trying to get pregnant if they’re taking riboflavin,” Dr. Greves says. “But I do say that you should be having well-balanced meals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to tell if you have a vitamin B2 deficiency&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, if you suspect you might have a vitamin B2 deficiency, it’s important to see a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation. “A blood test is the gold standard,” says &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://jessicacordingnutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jessica Cording, R.D;cpos:15;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica Cording, R.D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;., author of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/163228068X?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.65372376%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Little Book of Game-Changers;cpos:16;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;“This will give you information on how deficient you may be.” You and your healthcare provider can make decisions on next steps from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which foods are rich in vitamin B2?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few food sources of vitamin B2 to consider adding to your diet. According to the NIH, some of the biggest ones include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beef liver, 3 ounces, 2.9 milligrams&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortified breakfast cereals, 1 serving, 1.3 milligrams&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oats, 1 cup, 1.1 milligrams&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plain yogurt, 1 cup, 0.6 milligrams&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2% milk, 1 cup, 0.5 milligrams&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much B2 do I need?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;B2 recommendations vary slightly by age, sex, and life phase. Most genetic adult women need 1.1 milligrams a day of riboflavin, according to the NIH. However, those who are pregnant need 1.4 milligrams and those who are breastfeeding need 1.6 milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most genetic adult men need 1.3 milligrams daily of riboflavin, per the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I increase my B2 naturally?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding more B2-rich foods to your diet can help, Dr. Rodney says. “I recommend mostly focusing on your diet,” she says. If that doesn’t seem to help, she says a supplement may work—just consult a healthcare provider first about the proper dosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin B2 risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few things that may happen when you take vitamin B2. “Some individuals experience digestive discomfort, nausea, or bloating,” says Scott Keatley, R.D., co-owner of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy;cpos:17;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (Taking it on an empty stomach may make this worse, he says.) Something else to consider, per Keatley: “Excess riboflavin can turn urine bright yellow, which is harmless but sometimes alarming.” That said, you’re likely to just pee out the riboflavin you don’t need. “B2 is a water-soluble vitamin, so excess amounts are typically excreted in urine,” Gans says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Cording stresses the importance of only taking a supplement under the guidance of a healthcare provider. “It’s the best way to go,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet. They are not medicines and are not intended to treat, diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or cure diseases. Be cautious about taking dietary supplements if you are pregnant or nursing. Also, be careful about giving supplements to a child, unless recommended by their healthcare provider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 14:00:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTFBjbV9WX3BkSEY3WW4za2V4Y05PTnkzekRoRHdrZnpSMTUteUQwU2dscUJuSWtod2paUmFHclJncTRkN2NDOXZFYm4zeWdtQ2UwYlFTYmRvZ002LVNwNVVvY0ZKZ1FTaFZDMDZr</guid></item><item><title>亚利桑那州男子在与蔓延到他大脑的严重山谷热作斗争后找到希望- ABC15亚利桑那州 | Arizona man finds hope after battling severe Valley Fever that spread to his brain - ABC15 Arizona</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxPamZvNlY0OG8yZ21MWlNibkdpS1gtVzZ3MHh5NjNXWHRWRkM1UUhHb2o3RmJWOTU2U0RqSzRFYWF2VG9UR0dLLWVnaHAtN1lEd09xaXNlajJ3Q1FmY2FDRGMya0gwNktWUHhoR0VEcUloSGhmV2J1em5sS2wySGpYOWRmU05yZ24tVFcyYkJBTkxNeV9aQVpmSkhFWG9XMFdxM3ZvbFV6UUhQR19vMjMxZG5OTWJOa28?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Phoenix resident is showing signs of improvement after years of treatment for a severe case of Valley Fever that spread to his brain, requiring specialized care at the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most Valley Fever cases present with mild symptoms similar to the common cold, Chris is among the small percentage of patients whose infection spreads beyond the lungs, creating life-threatening complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The spores spread to my brain, which made my condition much more complex and dangerous," Chris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Marie Grill, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic who specializes in treating severe Valley Fever cases, has been overseeing Chris's treatment.

&lt;p&gt;Psilocybin, the main psychoactive ingredient in magic mushrooms, extends the lifespan of human cells, a lab study suggests. Researchers also found that the psychedelic compound slows certain hallmarks of aging in older mice while improving their fur quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, published July 8 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_8461513180531029056&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41514-025-00244-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fageing%2Fi-was-floored-by-the-data-psilocybin-shows-anti-aging-properties-in-early-study" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41514-025-00244-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fageing%2Fi-was-floored-by-the-data-psilocybin-shows-anti-aging-properties-in-early-study" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;npj Aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, provide the first experimental evidence of psilocybin's potential anti-aging properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The study provides a unique look at the potential of psychedelics to promote healthy aging and provides a provocative mechanism to explain how they do it," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/psychiatry/research/faculty-labs/laboratories-of-translational-psychiatry/scott-thompson" target="_blank" data-url="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/psychiatry/research/faculty-labs/laboratories-of-translational-psychiatry/scott-thompson" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Scott Thompson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the University of Colorado Department of Psychiatry who was not involved in the research, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, "much additional work will be required to take these findings forward in a way that will reveal whether or not the findings are applicable and adaptable for human health," Thompson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, studies have explored psilocybin's therapeutic potential for treating various conditions, such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10306375/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10306375/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;anxiety&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/385/bmj-2023-078084" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.bmj.com/content/385/bmj-2023-078084" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;depression&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and neurodegenerative disorders like &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11266071/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11266071/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The team found that the psilocin extended the lifespans of the cells by up to 57%, depending on the dose given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The psilocin also preserved the cells' telomere length and reduced levels of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/oxidative-stress" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/oxidative-stress" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or the buildup of reactive molecules.

(2025). npj Aging.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the psilocin made the cells appear like younger cells, Hecker told Live Science. Hecker's research involves looking at the impacts of aging on the body, and everything she knew to test for "just worked" she said. "I was floored by the data."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then went on to study the effects of psilocybin on approximately 19-month-old female mice — which, in human years, would be in their early 60s. The mice received monthly doses of psilocybin for 10 months. At the end of that period, 80% of the treated mice were still alive, compared with only 50% of an untreated group. The treated mice also displayed hair growth where they'd previously had bald spots, and their once-white hair grew back brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's exciting that we can give this intervention in late life and have such a dramatic impact," Hecker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychedelics, in general, are known to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_1161023596451825621&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-08880-9&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fageing%2Fi-was-floored-by-the-data-psilocybin-shows-anti-aging-properties-in-early-study" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08880-9" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-08880-9&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fageing%2Fi-was-floored-by-the-data-psilocybin-shows-anti-aging-properties-in-early-study" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;alter the workings of the immune system&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the body's &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_8018116739315346023&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fnpp201784&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fageing%2Fi-was-floored-by-the-data-psilocybin-shows-anti-aging-properties-in-early-study" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/npp201784" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fnpp201784&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fageing%2Fi-was-floored-by-the-data-psilocybin-shows-anti-aging-properties-in-early-study" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stress resilience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, both of which can affect organ health, Thompson said. "What is new in this study is the provocative suggestion that changes in the length of telomeres — important regulators of DNA replication — may be produced by psychedelics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major limitation of the study is that the drug doses used in the lab mice are much higher than those typically administered to humans, Thompson said. That said, Hecker argues that this comparison doesn't consider the much faster metabolism of mice and the consequently shortened time the psychedelics are active in the animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings set the stage for investigating psilocybin as a treatment for aging and age-related diseases, Hecker said.

But it’s widespread among those of us in wealthy, highly industrialized nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P45HQEDIIVBRVJH5FJAJYAXUEY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Why? A major study published this week in PNAS brings surprising clarity to that question. Using objective data about metabolic rates and energy expenditure among more than 4,000 men and women living in dozens of nations across a broad spectrum of socioeconomic conditions, the &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2420902122" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; quantified how many &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/06/13/weight-loss-calories-fiber-microbiome/" target="_blank"&gt;calories&lt;/a&gt; people from different cultures burn most days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="S2JSS34NC5HNLISIYVJPB43HPM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For decades, common wisdom and public health messaging have assumed that people in highly developed nations, like the United States, are relatively sedentary and burn far fewer daily calories than people in less-industrialized countries, greatly increasing the risk for obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IRP2RC32SRAGXK5LLLG3VZJ34Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the new study says no. Instead, it finds that Americans, Europeans and people living in other developed nations expend about the same number of total calories most days as hunter-gatherers, herders, subsistence farmers, foragers and anyone else living in less-industrialized nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CS4OXHEVDZB2LLIE4AUGR5XKDM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That unexpected finding almost certainly means inactivity is not the main cause of obesity in the U.S. and elsewhere, said Herman Pontzer, a professor of evolutionary anthropology and global health at Duke University in North Carolina and a senior author of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LGRUTP3EWVEOPCDMSW2PMGV7SU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What is, then? The study offers provocative hints about the role of diet and some of the specific foods we eat, as well as about the limits of exercise, and the best ways, in the long run, to avoid and treat obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="6G63EE4UA5DXPJOUJ7M57W5Y4E" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="6G63EE4UA5DXPJOUJ7M57W5Y4E" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Is diet or inactivity causing obesity?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BII7HAIURNB7DAJJNSR6EODF3Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“There’s still a lively debate in public health about the role of diet and activity” in the development of obesity, Pontzer said, especially in wealthy nations. Some experts believe we’re exercising too little, others that we’re eating too much, and still more that the two contribute almost equally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BNEABTOQ7BBSTPCTXUKOYPHKN4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Understanding the relative contributions of diet and physical activity is important, Pontzer noted, because we can’t effectively&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;help people with&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;obesity unless we first tease out its origins. But few large-scale studies have carefully compared energy expenditure among populations prone to obesity against those more resistant to it, which would be a first step toward figuring out what drives weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GNTTM2UDAJEGPDZNILDLIOXPII" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So, for the new study, Pontzer and his 80-plus co-authors gathered existing data from labs around the world that use doubly labeled water in metabolism studies. Doubly labeled water contains isotopes that, when excreted in urine or other fluids, allow researchers to precisely determine someone’s energy expenditure, metabolic rates and body-fat percentage.

Anyone expecting a wide range of energy expenditures, with hunter-gatherers and farmer-herders at the high end and deskbound American office workers trailing well behind, would be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NYO7IDQC6NFI5OBLZEMAQK5PGI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Across the board, the total daily energy expenditures of the 4,213 people were quite similar, no matter where they lived or how they spent their lives. Although the hunter-gatherers and other similar groups moved around far more throughout the day than a typical American, their overall daily calorie burns were nearly the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P4ZYVXOA3VFSTC3YGNXWUU2IG4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The findings, though counterintuitive, align with a new theory about our metabolisms, first proposed by Pontzer. Known as the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/11/27/exercise-weight-loss-science/" target="_blank"&gt;constrained total energy expenditure model&lt;/a&gt;, it says that our brains and bodies closely monitor our total energy expenditure, keeping it within a narrow range. If we start consistently burning extra calories by, for instance, stalking prey on foot for days or training for a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/10/25/marathon-recovery-strategies/" target="_blank"&gt;marathon&lt;/a&gt;, our brains slow down or shut off some tangential biological operations, often related to growth, and our overall daily calorie burn stays within a consistent band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="XR4EMZRYDZGBTIUE4ONKBN6XRI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="XR4EMZRYDZGBTIUE4ONKBN6XRI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The role of ultra-processed foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VSB6HMTR5FF3ZB75TADEACRSS4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The upshot is that “there is no effect of economic development on size-adjusted physical activity expenditure,” Pontzer says. In which case, the fundamental problem isn’t that we’re moving too little, meaning more exercise is unlikely to reduce obesity much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HPZAFSQZEZGIFC7RIBWNNRHDQA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What could, then? “Our analyses suggest that increased energy intake has been roughly 10 times more important than declining total energy expenditure in driving the modern obesity crisis,” the study authors write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C4X7HE3ITNCZTE2VHSGYSABJEY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In other words, we’re eating too much. We may also be eating the wrong kinds of foods, the study also suggests. In a sub-analysis of the diets of some of the groups from both highly and less-developed nations, the scientists found a strong correlation between the percentage of daily diets that consists of “&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/09/27/ultraprocessed-foods/" target="_blank"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;” — which the study’s authors define as “industrial formulations of five or more ingredients” — and higher body-fat percentages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SUVHEFBD6ZALBFQU7TUXF6PFYA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;We are, to be blunt, eating too much and probably eating too much of the wrong foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BSNVP6FXZRCT5JCPRFNUQZU7UM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“This study confirms what I’ve been saying, which is that diet is the key culprit in our current [obesity] epidemic,” said Barry Popkin, a professor at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and an obesity expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MNZ26ZHS5FFAVDYNL2MZGMDRG4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“This is a well-done study,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BSRFBAZKCBBRTEJI7RNNZ7K6ZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Other experts agree. “It’s clear from this important new research and other studies that changes to our food, not our activity, are the dominant drivers of obesity,” said Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WDATWET4ORFG3ASVWJWFFOSOG4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The findings don’t mean, though, that exercise is unimportant, Pontzer emphasized. “We know that exercise is essential for health.

But this ancient threat is still very much a danger in our modern world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to research published in 2022, the bacterium that causes typhoid fever is evolving extensive drug resistance, and is rapidly replacing strains that aren't resistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, antibiotics are the only way to effectively treat typhoid, which is caused by the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/em&gt; serovar Typhi (S Typhi). Yet over the past three decades, the bacterium's resistance to oral antibiotics has been growing and spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study, researchers sequenced the genomes of 3,489 S Typhi strains contracted from 2014 to 2019 in Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India, and found a rise in extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Typhi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XDR Typhi is not only impervious to frontline antibiotics, like ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, but it is also &lt;a href="https://www.coalitionagainsttyphoid.org/the-issues/drug-resistant-typhoid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;growing resistant&lt;/a&gt; to newer antibiotics, like fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/forgotten-antibiotic-from-decades-past-could-be-a-superbug-killer?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Forgotten Antibiotic From Decades Past Could Be a Superbug Killer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even worse, these strains are spreading globally at a rapid rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While most XDR Typhi cases stem from south Asia, researchers have identified nearly 200 instances of international spread since 1990.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_146183" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-146183" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/SalmonellaTyphiFlagellarStain.jpg" alt="salmonella typhi picture" class="wp-image-146183 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/SalmonellaTyphiFlagellarStain.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/SalmonellaTyphiFlagellarStain-600x333.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-146183" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Salmonella Typhi.

In 2016, the first XDR typhoid strain was identified in Pakistan. By 2019, it had become the dominant genotype in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, most XDR typhoid strains have been fought with third-generation antimicrobials, like quinolones, cephalosporins, and macrolides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by the early 2000s, mutations that confer resistance to quinolones accounted for more than 85 percent of all cases in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Singapore. At the same time, cephalosporin resistance was also taking over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href="https://www.coalitionagainsttyphoid.org/the-issues/drug-resistant-typhoid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;only one oral antibiotic is left&lt;/a&gt;: the macrolide, azithromycin. And this medicine might not work for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2022 study &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(22)00093-3/fulltext#seccestitle10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; mutations that confer resistance to azithromycin are now also spreading, "threatening the efficacy of all oral antimicrobials for typhoid treatment". While these mutations have not yet been adopted by XDR S Typhi, if they are, we are in serious trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If untreated, up to 20 percent of typhoid cases can be fatal, and today, there are 11 million cases of typhoid a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future outbreaks can be prevented to some extent with typhoid conjugate vaccines, but if access to these shots is not expanded globally, the world could soon have another health crisis on its hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The recent emergence of XDR and azithromycin-resistant S Typhi creates greater urgency for rapidly expanding prevention measures, including use of typhoid conjugate vaccines in typhoid-endemic countries," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(22)00093-3/fulltext#seccestitle10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Such measures are needed in countries where antimicrobial resistance prevalence among S Typhi isolates is currently high, but given the propensity for international spread, should not be restricted to such settings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Asia might be the main hub for typhoid fever, accounting for 70 percent of all cases, but if  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="167902" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; taught us anything, it is that disease variants in our modern, globalized world are easily spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent that from happening, health experts argue nations must expand access to typhoid vaccines and invest in new antibiotic research. One recent &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X21007131" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in India, for instance, estimates that if children are vaccinated against typhoid in urban areas, it could prevent up to 36 percent of typhoid cases and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is currently leading the way on this front. It was the first nation in the world to offer routine immunization for typhoid. Health experts argue more nations need to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antibiotic resistance is one of &lt;a href="the-third-leading-cause-of-death-globally-in-2019-was-antibiotic-resistant-bacterial-infection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the world's leading causes of death&lt;/a&gt;, claiming the lives of more people than  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hiv" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73049" data-postid="167902" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;/ &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hiv" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73049" data-postid="167902" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/malaria" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73073" data-postid="167902" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt;.

Below, experts explain why the tracking is off and what COVID is looking like this summer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COVID data from the CDC isn’t too accurate right now, and that’s for a number of reasons.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID tracking data from the CDC used to be a reliable way to look up COVID case numbers and hospitalizations in your area, but that isn’t the case anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since COVID lost its public health emergency designation status, “some of those tools and resources that we relied on for data are no longer being used,” said &lt;a href="https://www.elisabethmarnikphd.com/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Elisabeth Marnik" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68750aebe4b00af0c5f268a4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.elisabethmarnikphd.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Elisabeth Marnik&lt;/a&gt;, a scientist and science communicator based in Maine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospitals also aren’t required to report their COVID data to the CDC anymore, Marnik noted. This is one reason cases may appear to be lower than they really are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, some people, including some medical professionals, don’t look at COVID as a summer problem, said&lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/emily-landon" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" Dr. Emily Landon" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68750aebe4b00af0c5f268a4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/emily-landon" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt; Dr. Emily Landon&lt;/a&gt;, the executive medical director of Infection Prevention and Control at UChicago Medicine. This could mean less COVID testing in the summer, which means fewer COVID cases reported to hospitals and public health departments, Landon explained. And this could also make cases appear to be lower than they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But what doesn’t help that at all is the way the federal government, the new administration, is treating COVID as though it doesn’t exist,” Landon added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration put an end to&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/trump-administration-axes-covid-funding-state-community-health-departments" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" COVID funding" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68750aebe4b00af0c5f268a4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/trump-administration-axes-covid-funding-state-community-health-departments" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt; COVID funding&lt;/a&gt; for state and local health departments, as well as the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, certain health departments don’t have enough funding to properly track COVID infections in their area or to send their data on to the CDC, Landon explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The less funding there is for COVID and for public health in general, the less testing and sequencing and forwarding on of data, data collection and data aggregation,” Landon added. This also makes COVID cases appear to be lower than they actually are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We just don’t have as much data as we had a year ago or even a couple years ago when we were in that public health emergency,” Marnik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wastewater data is a good way to track COVID infections in your area, but it is still not a total picture.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if someone chooses not to test and brushes off a COVID infection as a “cold,” wastewater data can indicate when there are high levels of COVID in an area. Wastewater data tracks infections in sewers from toilets, showers and sinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While wastewater data, once again, isn’t as reliable as it once was, you can look at the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="CDC’s COVID wastewater data" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68750aebe4b00af0c5f268a4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;CDC’s COVID wastewater data&lt;/a&gt; dashboard to see how infection levels are in your area, said &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1821/suruchi-sood" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Suruchi Sood" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68750aebe4b00af0c5f268a4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1821/suruchi-sood" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Suruchi Sood&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also have a tool that I like better called &lt;a href="https://www.wastewaterscan.org/en" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="wastewaterscan.org" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68750aebe4b00af0c5f268a4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.wastewaterscan.org/en" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;wastewaterscan.org&lt;/a&gt;,” Marnik added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, right now, when I look at the data, the CDC page is saying COVID-19 levels are low in wastewater, whereas Wastewater Scan has been kind of toggling between high and medium,” Marnik noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, I think that kind of also shows that there’s some discrepancy between the data that the CDC has access to and the data that Wastewater Scan has access to,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither have a complete look at the country, she added, but both still give helpful information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also look at your local and state public health departments, which may have data on COVID cases in your region, Marnik said. As mentioned above, not all of these departments have enough funding to track this data, but you can check and see if it’s a good resource for your area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this information can help you stay safe from a COVID infection. For instance, if you know cases are high in your town, you can take additional precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Guido Mieth via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Guido Mieth via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;To protect yourself from COVID this summer, gather outside when possible and improve indoor circulation when not.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, COVID cases &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; increasing in many parts of the U.S.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Historically, if we look at all the past summers, we have had a summer spike,” Marnik noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC wastewater data, there’s a COVID increase in Florida and Alabama, Sood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you look at Wastewater Scan right now, we’re starting to see that the West Coast has high levels of SARS-CoV-2 detected in wastewater,” Marnik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also the case for the Northeast. “Whereas the Midwest area has low levels,” Marnik added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, it’s not unreasonable to think we likely will also be having a summer spike now, and the Wastewater Scan data ... because we’re starting to see higher rates in some areas of the country, indicates that we might be also heading for that summer spike,” Marnik added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, it’s impossible to predict how high of a spike we’ll have, noted Marnik.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;At UChicago Medicine, Landon said they’re seeing more COVID this week than last, and more employees are sick with COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, of course, doesn’t account for the folks who aren’t going to the hospital for COVID, so there is even more COVID out there, said Landon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nimbus COVID variant, or NB.1.8.1, is the &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="dominant variant " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68750aebe4b00af0c5f268a4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;dominant variant &lt;/a&gt;in the U.S., meaning it makes up the majority of cases right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been seeing it increasing for the last few weeks,” Landon noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;NB.1.8.1 could potentially “contribute to a summer wave,” Marnik said. “But ... we really just have to wait and see what it ends up looking like.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a peek into what COVID &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; look like in the U.S. this summer, experts look to the U.K. The U.S. tends to follow the U.K.’s COVID-19 patterns, Sood added&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They were seeing an increased amount of COVID-19, the Nimbus strain, but luckily, it actually wasn’t really strongly associated with a lot of hospitalizations,” Sood said. “So, all of that, to me is really quite reassuring.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID levels also weren’t as high as they were in previous summers in the U.K., Marnik noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases in the U.K. are starting to go down, Sood added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.K. tends to have higher rates of COVID vaccination than the U.S., though, Marnik said. This could mean fewer infections in the U.K. as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So it’s really hard to know how we’re going to compare to what we’re seeing in other parts of the world,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, there are more COVID cases in the U.S. than there were a few weeks ago. &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#maps_positivity-week" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="CDC data shows test positivity" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68750aebe4b00af0c5f268a4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#maps_positivity-week" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;CDC data shows test positivity&lt;/a&gt; is currently at 3.1%, up from 2.9%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what you can do to stay healthy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some summer activities — such as vacationing, lacking immunity from winter infections and vaccinations, and being in enclosed, air-conditioned spaces on hot days — can increase your risk of catching COVID, experts told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To lower your risk, there are a few things you can do, such as wearing a mask indoors and washing your hands well (and frequently), Landon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re 65 or older or have conditions that put you at high risk of complications from COVID, you are also &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s1023-covid-19-vaccine.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="eligible to get a second COVID shot" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68750aebe4b00af0c5f268a4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s1023-covid-19-vaccine.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;eligible to get a second COVID shot&lt;/a&gt; in the spring.

However, the symptom worsened after she was prescribed weight loss injections in November 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t have any other symptoms apart from that,” Stirling said of her heartburn, before adding, “I wasn’t losing weight, I wasn’t anemic, I didn’t have any blood in my stools or anything like that. I wasn’t vomiting, and my appetite was brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The typical symptoms that you see for stomach cancer, I had none of them,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Petrus Ibars/Getty&lt;/p&gt; Semaglutide injection pen (stock image)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heartburn is a common side effect of using weight loss injections. According to &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/obesity/mounjaro-side-effects" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:WebMD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WebMD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 1 in 50 people involved in a Mounjaro clinical trial experienced heartburn, acid reflux, or GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stirling said her symptoms largely went away after she stopped taking weight-loss injections, but she still went for an endoscopy in January 2024. A camera was placed down her throat and into her stomach to examine if there was any cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medics told her that she appeared to have an ulcer — an open sore in the stomach — that was almost “completely healed.” They also said she had Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), a common bacteria that can cause sores and inflammation in the lining of the stomach or the upper part of the small intestine, according to &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/h-pylori-helicobacter-pylori" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:WebMD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WebMD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In some cases, the bacteria can also lead to stomach cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They gave me some treatment and said to come back in six weeks [when they were planning to] check that the ulcer has healed,” Stirling recalled of the medics. “When I went back in six weeks, that little red mark was still there, so they sent some biopsies off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They had not said they were worried about cancer, which they would normally do if they were thinking ‘ooh it looks nasty,’ ” she continued. “I was completely blinded when three weeks later I got a phone call to say I have something called signet ring cell adenocarcinoma, which is the most aggressive stomach cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stirling was told that the disease was likely caused by the H. pylori that she could have unknowingly had since childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She explained that her diagnosis was followed by a staging laparoscopy — a keyhole operation that involves the use of small cameras to examine inside the abdomen. She then underwent multiple rounds of chemotherapy and had surgery to remove her entire stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;LightFieldStudios/Getty&lt;/p&gt; Woman in hospital (stock image)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stirling said a CT scan in January 2025 showed that she was “all clear,” but the surgeons have followed up with her every three months since and she is due to have another CT scan in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, I'm doing really well, getting my strength back,” she said. “I'm training for a half-marathon in October this year. I’m back in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Obviously, I've lost a lot of weight because I don't have a stomach, so my eating is very different now, I have a lot of smaller portions,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@clostirlingx/video/7519609762749697302" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TikTok video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TikTok video&lt;/a&gt;, Stirling encouraged viewers to seek medical help if they’re regularly experiencing heartburn, although the symptom isn’t always an indicator of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s so important to get little things checked out,” she said. “Even if you just think, ‘Oh, I’ll just see how it goes.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anything that you just know in your body isn’t right, I’d push to go and get it checked,” she added. “It’s what, like 15 minutes out of your day to go to a doctor’s appointment that could potentially save your life.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/woman-diagnosed-stomach-cancer-weight-loss-injections-heartburn-11772215" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 11:40:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1mYXZscVlBd2RmeEFDQXdXbDVGNVR5Uk1jRUhNSjBLblpFVFdTdU8wUDZBQ05ubnJBRzd0YXpoZVBaTGlkY1Z3bVZsQ2lMRkVDdmp5bmZLejVrZ3RNYUlPLXdfQm12UjhRdFFuMUNLbHdmazQ</guid></item><item><title>在开始服用GLP-1药物之前，医生希望你知道的5件事-《华盛顿邮报》 | 5 things doctors want you to know before you start taking a GLP-1 drug - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPVF9tRk1vOFZ2dEZQSHM0ak83VF9ySmZldTNWaXdRbjk2WFNhbTlEbkFNTkdsQThLa2ZZT2plcnQ5YzRkeVdLa3c5LXVfakdFMzRTRlliaTJ4N3ppbTJjYXRhRmE1eDhLMnRIVUdSOHJhcy1LNnE0VHJIZS1kWTRsVE1iYmJ6NTJ4a0R3RVpySQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EFH62P3V4FA3PIGLWRCSHHQU4Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Roughly 16 million American adults are taking &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/23/ozempic-wegovy-change-life-spending/" target="_blank"&gt;GLP-1 medications&lt;/a&gt;. They are a major breakthrough for people to shed pounds and manage conditions such as Type 2 diabetes. However, doctors say there’s a perception that weight-loss drugs such as semaglutide (brand names Ozempic and Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Zepbound) are all you need to live a healthier life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JWIMJOECNZAE5IZ3SJFGHONVJQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Diet and exercise still matter, said &lt;a href="https://prevmed.bwh.harvard.edu/joann-e-manson-md-dph/" target="_blank"&gt;JoAnn Manson&lt;/a&gt;, chief of the division of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4OYW2YZIQ5CFVEJICEG7KSWMGE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“They remain crucial,” Manson said. “If you’re not paying attention to protein intake, hydration and having regular physical activity — especially resistance training — you can end up with poor nutritional status and substantial muscle loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XDGKSFGJFZDJVOWQ5PYVL7UIG4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;GLP-1 drugs mimic a hormone the body produces to regulate hunger and blood sugar. The injections cut cravings for food, slow digestion and keep people feeling full for longer periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4NCTCHFXSFBHJATCL42UVVZB3Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However, since the drugs affect the stomach’s functions, they also can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and vomiting. Some people stop taking the drugs because of these gut symptoms. Still, Manson said, with some “relatively straightforward” changes in behavior, people can minimize these problems and continue using the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LNBG5PEWOZF6FM6JXBQR5BJWIM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Manson is a co-author of two articles — one for &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2836533?widget=personalizedcontent&amp;amp;previousarticle=0" target="_blank"&gt;clinicians&lt;/a&gt; and another for &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.1133?guestAccessKey=36da2db9-78f9-4823-be41-f21c6fa9a614&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=071425" target="_blank"&gt;patients&lt;/a&gt; — that were recently published in JAMA Internal Medicine.

The weight you lose might include muscle, too&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QGY3QHDK45EGVAUDE5HDNIPPR4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These medications can help someone lose around 15 to 21 percent of their body weight. But a significant portion of that weight — up to one-fourth — can be lean body mass and muscle, Manson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="3DZJGTLSLRFRVNP74YKDC67IYM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="3DZJGTLSLRFRVNP74YKDC67IYM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;2. It can help to start every meal with 20 to 30 grams of protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QVPDC2XBLVEH5NM6ZMUG5YYC3M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This protein can come&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;from chicken, fish, beans, chickpeas or tofu, Manson said. Aim for 1 to 1.5 grams of protein each day per kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body weight. If you don’t have an appetite or are eating smaller meals, you may want to try drinking a protein shake throughout the day as a supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZUUXS3V6PBFAFPUSQEDFVP2BRM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Manson and her co-authors suggest filling a plate this way: half fruits and vegetables, one-quarter protein, and the rest whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="Q6YZ2W4IF5DARPBOTOXULBNCDI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="Q6YZ2W4IF5DARPBOTOXULBNCDI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;3.

Acosta&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of medicine and a consultant in gastroenterology and hepatology at the Mayo Clinic, who has also consulted for Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, and has co-founded two weight-loss-associated companies, Phenomix Sciences and Gila Therapeutics, said he often finds that patients have a “preconceived notion” that they just need to take the medication and they’ll lose weight. But the clinical trials for these weight-loss drugs included “comprehensive programs” with lifestyle interventions for a calorie-reduced diet and exercise program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VBHME7KNWJF2HMJAWXEDOWS5BY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“This perception — just take the shot and don’t do anything else — is wrong. It’s not going to drive real, long-term behavioral changes,” said Acosta, who is a co-author of “The Mayo Clinic Diet: Weight-Loss Medications Edition.” “Patients aren’t going to see the outcomes that we’re seeing in the trials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4GOJZZAHGNDCJP7JKE65RRJVHY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The GLP-1 medications are one tool in a broader weight-management program, Acosta said. He tells people they still need to have a healthy diet, with “a good amount of protein” and enough water to stay well hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X5DQJIKESFGAFJJEXTHWMRT5IA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I like to set the expectations from the get-go,” Acosta said. “And I also tell them that not everyone is going to lose weight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7VUYMBA75BCDPHEOKBUTQUYPYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some people will gain back weight when they stop taking these medications, said &lt;a href="https://publichealth.buffalo.edu/exercise-and-nutrition-sciences/faculty-and-staff/faculty-directory/em1.html" target="_blank"&gt;Elizabeth Mietlicki-Baase&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of exercise and nutrition sciences at the University of Buffalo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UPH742CWPRCD3BZQRA7GWY726Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers are interested in “finding strategies to prevent weight regain after discontinuation,” she said. “But we don’t have a great handle on that just yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 11:31:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxPVF9tRk1vOFZ2dEZQSHM0ak83VF9ySmZldTNWaXdRbjk2WFNhbTlEbkFNTkdsQThLa2ZZT2plcnQ5YzRkeVdLa3c5LXVfakdFMzRTRlliaTJ4N3ppbTJjYXRhRmE1eDhLMnRIVUdSOHJhcy1LNnE0VHJIZS1kWTRsVE1iYmJ6NTJ4a0R3RVpySQ</guid></item><item><title>研究显示，童年创伤影响成人压力评估和心理健康结果- Medical Xpress | Childhood trauma shapes adult stress appraisal and mental health outcomes, research reveals - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQSEhZSm1QSDQ3djI3d05BcDE4VkpQYmJObVJXOGxsZ1NERzFhbE1MbWpmbGZoSGpFeDU1Y3JzeWpoNS1Hek14emYydThSdVd3dTgybENuTHM2aDhEN1FDSGtQQXdNenZNcHYtZGpRaFZhdGJmTHRTVklBRHZjRXpoWGJPV0lDYUU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Leeds psychologists report that stress appraisal and perceived stress act as key conduits linking childhood trauma to adult depression, anxiety, defeat, and entrapment.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Childhood trauma affects nearly one third of young people in the United Kingdom. Early experiences of abuse or neglect have been associated with depression, anxiety, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/post-traumatic+stress+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;post-traumatic stress disorder&lt;/a&gt;, and substance use later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposure to multiple types of trauma has been linked to higher rates of suicidal thoughts and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/suicide+attempts/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;suicide attempts&lt;/a&gt;. Females who experience childhood sexual abuse can face substantially elevated risks of attempting suicide compared to peers without such histories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has examined connections between &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/childhood+trauma/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;childhood trauma&lt;/a&gt; and feelings of defeat and entrapment, which are regarded as indicators of suicide risk. Daily hassles have been proposed as contributors to poor health outcomes that can surpass the impact of acute traumatic events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Effects of childhood trauma on mental health outcomes, suicide risk factors and stress appraisals in adulthood," &lt;a href="https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326120" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;PLOS One&lt;/i&gt;, researchers adopted an online prospective design to investigate whether childhood trauma was associated with mental health outcomes, suicide risk factors, and stress-related outcomes, and to determine whether stress appraisal and perceived stress mediate the effects of childhood trauma on these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;A total of 273 adults participated, with a mean age of 38 years. Nearly 48.4% identified as male. Most participants identified as white and reported employment status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recruitment occurred through the Prolific Academic &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/online+platform/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;online platform&lt;/a&gt;. Participants completed two online sessions one week apart. Session 1 included questionnaires assessing demographics, childhood trauma, perceived social support, subjective socioeconomic status, and lifetime suicide-related experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Session 2 included measures of daily stress appraisals, perceived stress, depression severity, anxiety severity, perceived defeat, and perceived entrapment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers used the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Daily Stressor Appraisal Scale, Perceived Stress Scale—Brief, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7, Defeat Scale, Entrapment Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status, and Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey. Moderation analyses tested the influence of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/social+support/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;social support&lt;/a&gt;, subjective socioeconomic status, and prior suicide-related history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greater exposure to childhood trauma was associated with roughly 15 to 35% higher scores on depression, anxiety, defeat, and entrapment compared to those reporting less trauma exposure. Higher childhood trauma was linked to increases in perceived stress and stress appraisal scores by similar proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significant indirect effects via perceived stress and via stress appraisal emerged for every mental-health and suicide-risk outcome. Social support, subjective socioeconomic status, and prior suicide-related history did not moderate those associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors conclude that everyday cognitive evaluations of hassles form a psychological bridge from early adversity to adult distress, suggesting that interventions for trauma survivors could sharpen their focus on stress appraisal alongside conventional symptom-based treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

The investigation shows that nearly half of the files examined underwent wording changes while leaving the official change logs blank. The authors warn that hidden edits of this kind can ripple through public health research and erode confidence in federal data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reach these findings, the researchers started by downloading the online catalogues—known as harvest sources—that federal agencies maintain under the 2019 Open Government Data Act. They gathered every entry from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Veterans Affairs that showed a modification date between January 20 and March 25, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After removing duplicates and files that are refreshed at least monthly, the team was left with 232 datasets. For each one, they located an archived copy that pre‑dated the study window, most often through the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then used the comparison feature in a word‑processing program to highlight every textual difference between the older and newer versions. Only wording was assessed; numeric tables were not rechecked. Finally, the investigators opened the public change log that sits at the bottom of each dataset’s web page to see whether the alteration had been declared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One example captures how the edits appeared in practice. A file from the Department of Veterans Affairs that tracks the number of veterans using healthcare services in the 2021 fiscal year had sat untouched for more than two years. On March 5, 2025, the column heading “Gender” was replaced with “Sex.” The same swap was made in the dataset’s title and in the short description at the top of the page. The modification date on the site updated to reflect the change, yet the built‑in change log still reads, “No changes have been archived yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the full sample, the pattern was strikingly consistent. One hundred fourteen of the 232 datasets—49 percent—contained what the authors judged to be potentially substantive wording changes. Of these, 106 switched the term “gender” to “sex.” Four files replaced the phrase “social determinants of health” with “non‑medical factors,” one exchanged “socio‑economic status” for “socio‑economic characteristics,” and a single clinical trial listing rewrote its title so that “gender diverse” became “include men and women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 89 cases, the revision affected text that defines the data itself, such as column names or category labels. The remaining 25 changes occurred in narrative descriptions or tags that sit above the data table. Only 25 of the 114 altered files—less than one in seven—acknowledged the revision in their official logs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing followed a marked acceleration: four edits occurred in the final days of January, 30 during February, and 82 during the first three and a half weeks of March—suggesting an intensified push as spring approached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These government datasets form the backbone of countless psychology, sociology, and public health projects. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, for instance, supplies yearly survey information on smoking, exercise, diet, and chronic illness across every state. It is routinely mined to study links between health behavior and mental well‑being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease and stroke mortality files from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention help social scientists examine how stress, neighborhood environment, or discrimination align with geographic patterns in illness and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutrition and physical activity surveys inform work on childhood obesity and its ties to screen time or family structure. Researchers who focus on veteran mental health rely on Department of Veterans Affairs summaries to track service‑connected disability, access to therapy, and suicide risk among former service members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When variable labels shift from “gender” to “sex” in these resources, studies that compare answers given under the old wording with figures retrieved after the change are no longer aligning like‑with‑like. Even a single undocumented edit can scramble replication attempts, invalidate earlier statistical models, or make it impossible to detect real trends in the underlying population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications stretch beyond statistical concerns. Survey designers distinguish between gender, a social identity, and sex, a biological classification, because the two terms capture related but not identical information. Many transgender and non‑binary respondents, for example, select a gender option that differs from the sex recorded on their birth certificate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the government retroactively re‑labels a column without clarifying whether the underlying question also changed, analysts cannot tell whether a fluctuation in the male‑to‑female ratio reflects genuine demographic shifts, a wording tweak, or recoding behind the scenes. Public health officials may then allocate resources on a faulty premise, and medical guidelines that depend on demographic baselines can drift off target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study point to a possible political origin for the edits. They note that the White House issued a directive in early February instructing agencies to purge material seen as advancing “gender ideology”—language echoed by several state administrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No federal office has publicly confirmed that the dataset edits were carried out in response, yet the timing and the tight focus on the term “gender” hint at coordinated action. If the goal was to bring terminology across agencies into alignment, the transparency required by the Open Government Data Act appears to have been set aside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation is not without limits. Because many archives extend back only a few years, the researchers could not examine earlier periods for similar actions. They judged whether a change was routine or substantive by hand, an approach that introduces subjectivity. They also left numerical content untouched; it remains unknown whether any figures were edited alongside the wording.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the findings, the authors suggest a series of steps that scholars and institutions can take to protect the reliability of public data. Independent groups already mirror many federal datasets on private servers, and individual investigators can save local copies of files they intend to analyze. Routine spot checks against archived versions can help reveal unexpected alterations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International repositories such as Europe PubMed Central offer alternative hosting for biomedical resources, lowering dependence on any single government. Most important, the researchers argue, is a cultural commitment to full version tracking inside federal agencies—so that every member of the public can see exactly what changed, when it changed, and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01249-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Data manipulation within the US Federal Government&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Janet Freilich and Aaron S.

But were misaligned smiles always this common? Research suggests that might not be the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While malocclusions—crowded or misaligned teeth—have been found among our hunter-gatherer ancestors, they appear to be more prevalent in modern populations. So what changed? Experts say the answer isn’t simple but point to one possible culprit: our diets. As we traded raw, tough foods for softer, more processed ones, the burden of chewing decreased, allowing our jaws to shrink over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, researchers are exploring how evolutionary biology, diet, and modern lifestyles may have reshaped our faces—and our smiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How farming may have reshaped the human face&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ancient human skulls were strikingly different from our own. Early hunter-gatherers had &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/who-are-you-calling-weak-human-jaws-are-surprisingly-strong-and-efficient" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:large, powerful jaws;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;large, powerful jaws&lt;/a&gt; built for the demanding work of chewing tough meats, fibrous vegetables, seeds, and nuts. But around 12,000 years ago, things began to change. As humans around the world traded hunting for farming, their diets changed too, incorporating more grains and cultivated produce into their diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These foods were softer, more processed, and required far less chewing.” We did not have ice cream or white bread back in the day,” says &lt;a href="https://www.biology.washington.edu/people/profile/susan-w-herring" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sue Herring;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Sue Herring&lt;/a&gt;, professor emeritus in orthodontics at the University of Washington. “When you get your food straight from the environment, it’s probably a little [grittier] than stuff which has been cooked and processed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/news-neanderthal-teeth-nursing-seasons-stress" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Neanderthal teeth reveal intimate details of daily life;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;i&gt;Neanderthal teeth reveal intimate details of daily life&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With softer diets came &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/70/9/759/5872832" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:less mechanical strain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;less mechanical strain&lt;/a&gt; on the jaw. Over generations, our mandibles began to shrink— a trend visible &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16421925/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:in the fossil record;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;in the fossil record&lt;/a&gt;. That shrinkage is, at least in part, adaptive and the result of millennia of evolution, says &lt;a href="https://www.dental.upenn.edu/faculty/myra-f-laird-ph-d/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Myra Laird;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Myra Laird&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor of basic and translational sciences at the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine. “If you don’t need a huge mandible, it’s energetically costly to build that extra bone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But not all changes in jaw size and shape are evolutionary. Bone is highly responsive to physical stress—even within a single lifetime—and builds up around muscle attachment sites. In other words, less muscle usage results in less robust bones, Laird says, citing studies of craniofacial growth in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004724840400051X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:non-human animals like hyraxes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;non-human animals like hyraxes&lt;/a&gt;. “If you switch to a liquid diet, you will not use your muscles as much and see some shape changes in your face.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/ultra-processed-foods-damage-brain-depression-anxiety-cognitive-decline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Here’s how ultra-processed food harms the body and brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here’s how ultra-processed food harms the body and brain&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That’s exactly what researchers believe happened to humans &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1702586114#sec-2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:as they adopted agriculture;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;as they adopted agriculture&lt;/a&gt;. “Post-agricultural populations had a marked reduction in the size of the chewing muscles,” Laird says. “What this suggests is that the origins of agriculture brought about less work for the feeding system”—and, ultimately, much less roomy mouths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How smaller jaws may be crowding our teeth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So, what happens when you try to fit the same number of teeth into a smaller jaw space? Over-crowding and crookedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The way your teeth come through is almost like a zipper,” says &lt;a href="https://jlawrence.scholars.harvard.edu//bio" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Julie Lawrence;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Julie Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor of biological anthropology at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “Your jaw moves forward and then it makes space for them to come through.” If there isn’t enough room for the teeth to erupt, they might become impacted or crowded together. The third molars, or wisdom teeth, are particularly at risk for noneruption in undersized jaws. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3241821/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research suggests;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that the mismatch between the size of the mandible and dentition may be to blame for increasingly crooked teeth among post-industrial humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“That loss of space is really what precipitates the malocclusions, dental crowding,” says Laird. “The rate of malocclusion goes way, way up [in modern humans], and that is ubiquitous across all populations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/fluoride-drinking-tap-water-health-controversy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Why we add fluoride to water—and how it became so controversial;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why we add fluoride to water—and how it became so controversial&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But experts caution that the story isn’t so simple. Although the frequency of malocclusions seems to have increased among modern humans, dental impaction and crowding have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8372939/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:been observed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;been observed&lt;/a&gt; in early hominid skulls. The fossil record is limited and likely not fully representative, Lawrence says. “Better teeth tend to be better preserved,” she says, adding that anthropological data doesn’t take into account confounding factors like missing teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While “there does seem to be a pattern” of increased malocclusions among post-industrialization humans, Lawrence adds, not all changes in teeth alignment can be attributed to diet. Extreme under- or overbite, for example, is the result of population genetics and “doesn’t have to do with industrialization.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many other factors can cause crooked teeth, including environmental conditions or developmental anomalies. And some populations are more genetically predisposed to malocclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ultimately, the prevalence of crooked teeth may also be due in small part to aesthetic bias. “Our modern society is a lot more sensitive to cosmetic problems,” Herring says. “I think we’re a lot more aware of malocclusions now than anybody was in the past.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxNQWh0VTZzbTJZaS11LUdJMGpKYThJTERfeDVtVUlmWjdrREtLVTZTU0pZQlRoa2h5cl9FWmx4WVJhREZubWVEaDRWWXJZR0tXY3R2ZkV0dEZ0a0Vjd2N3WDBzU1RVc1lrdnpTREFnTTZiY3RaRm9DaGhlVkJWbEdCWU5rbnI</guid></item><item><title>OpenEvidence联合创始人Daniel Nadler现在是亿万富翁。-福布斯 | OpenEvidence Cofounder Daniel Nadler Is Now A Billionaire. - Forbes</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxQOGJrUnpaLVBRUTJkeVE0OUFjeU1Xb29fb2cxYUQybnMtOC1hM3h2d3MxZl9iMjdpN3hJcUtUY2VCV2RibDB5TFRVblQ0LVM3SmFsdmRkQ0ZUYldRSzNpWURTOVNrcUlORGQtaWdaTFo1XzZZWlB0OTV1bG9ESldyOWwzcVJtVDMtNEZuREFqOEgyczdyVUtCYjd4TWlPRElIZXJJbjJrRXhqV2xSRTQ4Y1BVZDg0dUdZbWZ5Qg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="fs-article fs-premium fs-responsive-text current-article font-body color-body bg-base font-accent article-body premium-container"&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Daniel Nadler started OpenEvidence to help physicians sort through a deluge of medical research. Now, he’s raised $210 million at a $3.5 billion valuation.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light"&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr class="drop-cap color-accent font-accent"&gt;F&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;strong&gt;or doctors trying to stay abreast&lt;/strong&gt; of the latest medical breakthroughs, reviewing the latest research is like being shot in the face with a water cannon. A new paper is published every 30 seconds. Trying to comb through it all to come up with a diagnosis or treatment plan that reflects the best current options while seeing 20 patients a day is a near-impossible task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We talk about the golden age of biotechnology where there are new drugs and better drugs developed all the time. But it is like the dark ages for physicians because of burnout,” Daniel Nadler, cofounder and CEO of OpenEvidence, told &lt;em&gt;Forbes. &lt;/em&gt;“There is this enormous firehose of information they need to stay on top of, and the human brain is limited in its capacity to read millions of studies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-53" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="color-body light-text"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mauricio Candela for Forbes&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Nadler, 42, a Harvard Ph.D. who sold his previous company for $550 million back in 2018, set out to solve the problem with artificial intelligence. Now, the startup’s proprietary algorithms search millions of peer-reviewed publications, including in top journals like the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association, &lt;/em&gt;to help doctors find the best answers fast, with full citations to papers so doctors can read more for themselves. The software is free for verified doctors to use and makes money through advertising–much like Google does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think OpenEvidence looks like it’s going to be for healthcare what Google was for the Internet,” said Kleiner Perkins billionaire chairman John Doerr, who invested in the company personally as well as through his firm, adding, “It’s the free-for-physician model that’s the magic here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its founding in 2022, Miami-based OpenEvidence has signed up 40% of doctors in the United States, or more than 430,000, and is adding new ones at a current rate of 65,000 per month. Its revenue from advertising is now coming in at an annualized rate estimated at $50 million. That’s not huge, but thanks to the software’s rapid adoption, investors are betting big: OpenEvidence has raised $210 million led by GV (Google’s venture arm) and Kleiner Perkins at a valuation of $3.5 billion, up from $1 billion at its last financing in February, Nadler told &lt;em&gt;Forbes. &lt;/em&gt;Other storied VC firms like Coatue, Conviction and Thrive Capital also invested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new investment makes Nadler, who owns roughly 60% of the company, a billionaire, with a net worth that &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; estimates at $2.3 billion. Cofounder Zack Ziegler, the company’s 30-year-old chief technology officer, owns some 10% of the business, worth about $350 million. Nadler was able to hold on to such a large stake by being its first seed investor, putting in some $10 million of his own money before raising any VC funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the great things about being a second-time entrepreneur is, I’m not an idiot,” Nadler said. “I think the second thing is going to be bigger than the first so maybe the first $10 million should come from me. That’s by far the smartest financial decision I made in my life…..I wanted to bet on myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem OpenEvidence is addressing is enormous, and one that’s only getting bigger. Medical literature is proliferating at a meteoric rate—doubling in size every five years—as new treatment options like gene therapies are developed and scientists learn more about how different diseases and drugs may interact with each other. Sorting through all of it is a herculean task: some papers are excellent, some are bad and many more are outdated. (With AI being used to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01592-0" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01592-0" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01592-0" aria-label="publish"&gt;publish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00894-7" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00894-7" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00894-7" aria-label="review"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; research papers, the problem has only gotten worse.) Meanwhile, physicians in the United States are increasingly strapped for time, given a growing shortage of medical professionals—creating an opportunity for startups to build technology that can help provide better care and relieve pressure on doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="embed-base quote-embed embed-24 bg-accent color-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When everyone was scrambling to come out of crypto, I was like, ‘I am just going to run circles around all of you.’”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;footer class="text-align"&gt;Daniel Nadler, cofounder and CEO, OpenEvidence&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenEvidence isn’t the first company to try to make sense of the overload of medical publications; Wolters Kluwer’s UpToDate has been around for decades and has recently been incorporating AI, along with advice from experts, to do the same thing. But it is the first to build software that integrates AI from the start to make it easier for doctors to find answers to pressing clinical questions and to do so far more accurately than ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors now use OpenEvidence on some 8.5 million consultations a month. Because the tool isn’t considered diagnostic, it doesn’t need FDA approval as algorithms used to detect strokes or sepsis in patients do. And since doctors can download it or use it online for free, it can bypass the lengthy and bureaucratic procurement process with hospitals or large group practices. That’s helped the company sign up doctors at an ever-faster clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Susan Wolver, an internist in Richmond, Va., has become a true believer, using OpenEvidence to write prior authorization letters and look up details of drugs. Most dramatically, while she was on a domestic flight recently, an immunocompromised passenger nearly fainted in the bathroom. Wolver turned to OpenEvidence to figure out the patient’s immune-system risks and come up with a treatment plan on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think a day goes by when I don’t use it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;abbr class="drop-cap color-accent font-accent"&gt;N&lt;/abbr&gt;adler grew up in Toronto&lt;/strong&gt; where his parents were part of the great wave of post-war Eastern European immigrants–his father from Romania and his mother from Poland. “My grandfather was in Auschwitz and survived,” he said. “After the second world war, my grandfather wanted to come to America, and America wasn’t letting people in so they made their way to Canada.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a kid, Nadler was competitive to a fault, dabbling in memory games to see whether he could recite more pages of a &lt;em&gt;Hamlet &lt;/em&gt;soliloquy&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;than a friend. “I was a total nerd,” he said. A Mensa member, he found school boring, and after getting a bachelor’s degree at the University of Toronto, applied to Harvard for grad school, hoping for a greater challenge. Once there, he got a Ph.D in political economy, writing his thesis on the pricing mechanisms of credit derivatives. He also studied poetry under Pulitzer Prize-winner Jorie Graham, launched an app called &lt;a href="https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/QrNVCxko4Kskz1kECvhviy0oSV?domain=thecrimson.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/QrNVCxko4Kskz1kECvhviy0oSV?domain=thecrimson.com/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/QrNVCxko4Kskz1kECvhviy0oSV?domain=thecrimson.com/" aria-label="Sigmund"&gt;Sigmund&lt;/a&gt; that could be programmed to speak specific words during sleep to influence a user’s dreams and served as a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadler was working on his Ph.D., and making just $23,500 a year as a grad student, when he got the idea for his first company, Kensho. At the Fed, he’d been stunned to learn that its regulators relied on rudimentary Excel spreadsheets to make critical assessments. So he teamed up with programmer Peter Kruskall to build algorithms to make financial analysis as easy as a search on Google. When Kensho launched its text-based chatbot, Warren (as in Buffett) in 2012, artificial intelligence was still the province of academics, not the red hot center of the startup world that it is today. “No one was talking about AI in 2012. You are talking about 10 years before ChatGPT,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea worked, and when S&amp;amp;P bought Kensho, paying $700 million, including retention bonuses, it became the &lt;a href="https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/mF98Cwpn4JfK2GKlCVfriJh_EG?domain=forbes.com/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/mF98Cwpn4JfK2GKlCVfriJh_EG?domain=forbes.com/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/mF98Cwpn4JfK2GKlCVfriJh_EG?domain=forbes.com/" aria-label="largest AI deal"&gt;largest AI deal&lt;/a&gt; in history. Nadler, who owned 20%, was suddenly rich. “For second-time founders, that hubris is [often] gone,” said GV partner Sangeen Zeb. “Daniel still has that hubris.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, he teamed up with Ziegler, who was working on a Ph.D. in machine learning at Harvard, but really just wanted to build stuff. The two had a hunch that the AI technology that had helped make traders smarter by finding patterns in large swathes of data could also aid doctors–with even greater impact. Both were also motivated by personal experience. Nadler’s grandfather had died due to a medical error, while Ziegler had watched his brother-in-law, then 22, go through treatment for leukemia. (He’s in remission now.) “It was really eye-opening to me,” Ziegler said. “There’s this enormous amount of complexity, but the way doctors are accessing it is literally leafing through a textbook.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="embed-base quote-embed embed-27 bg-accent color-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think OpenEvidence looks like it’s going to be for healthcare what Google was for the Internet.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;footer class="text-align"&gt;John Doerr, chairman, Kleiner Perkins&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venture capitalist Jim Breyer, who had invested in Kensho, spent four hours talking with Nadler about his idea for OpenEvidence and became one of its first outside investors (along with billionaire investor Ken Moelis) in 2022. Breyer, who’d famously backed Mark Zuckerberg in 2005, considers Nadler among a rarified group of founders. “Daniel is an extraordinary entrepreneur,” he said. “The initial insight of applying AI to medical journals was simply brilliant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2023, OpenEvidence joined the Mayo Clinic’s prestigious accelerator for health tech startups. The program allows startups to refine their ideas—and their technology—at the hospital that, as Nadler noted in a &lt;a href="https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/L4BNCyPpgLfZprZOuQiOixPbta?domain=youtube.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/L4BNCyPpgLfZprZOuQiOixPbta?domain=youtube.com" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/L4BNCyPpgLfZprZOuQiOixPbta?domain=youtube.com" aria-label="2023 video"&gt;2023 video&lt;/a&gt; for the program, “has the largest and highest quality dataset in healthcare.” By this point, AI was booming. Nadler’s decade in the field quickly began to pay off. “When everyone was scrambling to come out of crypto, I was like, ‘I am just going to run circles around all of you,’” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, this is a tough business and there are questions about whether AI-based search will always give the best answer. Nadler argues that by relying on the “gold standards of medical knowledge,” many of which aren’t available on the open internet beyond abstracts—including &lt;em&gt;JAMA &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine­­&lt;/em&gt;­—the startup’s search ranking models are able to extract reliable and relevant information about a rare disease or a drug’s side effects, while keeping hallucinations (AI’s tendency to fabricate facts) at a minimum. “AI is garbage in, garbage out, gold in, gold out,” Nadler said, adding, “Not everything is about coming up with a super nerdy algorithm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stephen Krieger, a multiple sclerosis specialist at Mount Sinai in New York, heard about OpenEvidence from a resident this past weekend when he was doing rounds in the hospital. He needed to find out what antibiotic to use for a neurological infection in someone allergic to penicillin, something outside his own clinical expertise. Before relying on it, he tested its accuracy by asking OpenEvidence about his own research on MS (and also confirmed its answer with his infectious disease colleagues). Not only did it correctly summarize his research, it properly noted constraints that had yet to be published. "The idea that it offered to tell me the limitations of my own work and I agreed with it I thought was kind of great,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="embed-base quote-embed embed-29 bg-accent color-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the great things about being a second-time entrepreneur is, I’m not an idiot.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;footer class="text-align"&gt;Daniel Nadler, cofounder and CEO, OpenEvidence&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Daniel Byrne, a lecturer at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and author of the book &lt;em&gt;Artificial Intelligence for Improved Patient Outcomes, &lt;/em&gt;said it’s not so simple. “What I found that most people misunderstand is that up to half the medical literature is wrong,” he said, noting that papers will often be published about scientific debates or clinical studies that may not ultimately pan out. “Having a reference is a step in the right direction, but it’s just not enough,” Byrne said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Travis Zack, OpenEvidence’s medical director, says that while there will be errors from any AI system, there should be far fewer than with doctors making judgment calls for 20 patients a day without easily consulting the available literature. “What OpenEvidence does is allow physicians to not have to trust their gut,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="embed-base quote-embed embed-28 bg-accent color-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI is garbage in, garbage out, gold in, gold out.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;footer class="text-align"&gt;Daniel Nadler, cofounder and CEO, OpenEvidence&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also remains to be seen how successful OpenEvidence’s ad model will be. Pharmaceutical companies are big spenders, and now they have an opportunity to get detailed information about their drugs in front of doctors who are likely to use them. Thanks to sponsored answers, the company is able to keep the tool free for doctors, helping attract more clinicians and allowing it to tweak its algorithm (and improve search results) based on their feedback. That creates what Nadler calls a “fantasy flywheel,” in which having more users makes the product better, which draws more users, ad infinitum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite healthcare and pharma ad spending amounting to some $30 billion in 2024, building an ad-based business is unusual in healthtech, where most software is sold on a subscription basis. “People hate on advertising,” Nadler said. “I don’t know why—I love advertising.” But even he notes that the company currently has a far greater potential inventory of ads, more than $350 million, than it has sold to date. “Google spent time getting people comfortable with the model, and that’s what we are doing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;abbr class="drop-cap color-accent font-accent"&gt;D&lt;/abbr&gt;r. Aneesh Singhal, &lt;/strong&gt;vice chair of Massachusetts General Hospital’s department of neurology and director of the hospital’s stroke center, downloaded OpenEvidence a year ago, after reading about it in a mass email sent out to the hospital system. Since then he’s noticed the tool gain popularity among his residents and surgeon colleagues. “Everybody seems to be using it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wanted to search for the latest studies on stroke in adults—a daunting task that would otherwise take hours of rummaging through PubMed and online textbooks. The tool proved far better than a generic chatbot like ChatGPT, suggesting follow-up questions to ask about a patient’s medical history and tests that should be conducted, he said. “ChatGPT stops short in that it just gives you the direct answer,” Singhal says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenEvidence’s momentum so far has been staggering as it signs up doctors at an ever-faster clip, a key metric that investor Breyer wants to see. “Getting the weekly and monthly updates gives me enormous confidence that Daniel continues to knock it out of the park,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it’s pushing into using so-called reasoning models, which think through a task in steps, a tactic researchers have found makes AI answers better and more robust. This month, the startup launched a new feature called DeepConsult, which uses this technique to connect the dots between different studies and carry out advanced research on a particular topic. “It allows a physician to essentially have a team of M.D. Ph.D.s that can go off while the physician is doing other things and do that enormously deep amount of research,” cofounder Ziegler said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while OpenEvidence’s tech could be used in a similar way for other scientific fields, Nadler isn’t focused on expansion there yet: he wants to stick to healthcare, both in the U.S. and internationally, especially in countries where access to quality care is limited. Across the industry, there is now a mosaic of AI-powered technology, from &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiejennings/2024/02/23/abridge-raises-150-million-to-make-ai-medical-scribes-even-smarter/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiejennings/2024/02/23/abridge-raises-150-million-to-make-ai-medical-scribes-even-smarter/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiejennings/2024/02/23/abridge-raises-150-million-to-make-ai-medical-scribes-even-smarter/" aria-label="notetakers"&gt;notetakers&lt;/a&gt; for doctors to clinical diagnostic tools. Pair that with a patient’s lab results and data from medical devices like blood glucose monitors, and there’s an opportunity to bring all of that information together, in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coatue cofounder Thomas Laffont, who is invested in OpenEvidence, sees the startup someday becoming the hub where all these tools might converge. “You can squint to a world where OpenEvidence becomes the tool through which all that diagnosis is happening,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

His friend Isaiah Berlin called it a ‘dead secret’ – Austin himself had ‘no idea’ how little time was left. As Hilary term approached, Austin requested a mere four weeks’ leave until his glands ‘cleared up’. He died five weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Austin is best known for speech act theory, which teaches that language does not simply convey information but performs actions. In short, we &lt;em&gt;do things &lt;/em&gt;with words.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;One word, however, is conspicuously absent from Austin’s late correspondence. &lt;em&gt;Cancer. &lt;/em&gt;Lung cancer, Austin’s ‘grave’ diagnosis, claimed his life at &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;age 48.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many at the time, Austin’s doctors, family and friends avoided naming his disease. ‘Cancer’ was a whispered word, a taboo too terrible to speak. Physicians routinely withheld the diagnosis, fearing that merely uttering it would extinguish all hope and hasten death. As one writer observed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Cancer patients are lied to, not just because the disease is (or is thought to be) a death sentence, but because it is felt to be obscene – in the original meaning of that word: ill-omened, abominable, repugnant to the senses.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That writer – Susan Sontag – like Austin, was an astute observer of the power of language. In &lt;em&gt;Illness as Metaphor&lt;/em&gt; (1978),&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Sontag exposed how metaphors surrounding illness, especially cancer, do more than describe; they shape perception, reinforce stigma, and impose narratives that can harm. She called for a ‘liberation’ from these metaphors, arguing that we must stop treating cancer as ‘an evil, invincible predator’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;ontag died of cancer in 2004. By then, the narrative had shifted. When she was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 1975, there were no pink ribbons or ads urging early detection and treatment. By her death, however, cancer had moved from private affliction to &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/how-breast-cancer-rips-up-conventional-markers-of-gender" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;public crusade&lt;/a&gt;. Women marched in solidarity; men grew moustaches for Movember; athletes donned pink jerseys, while coloured wristbands signalled support for everything from leukaemia to pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer was no longer a shameful obscenity but a rallying cry. Shattering the silence was undoubtedly progress. But with this shift came new metaphors – and new expectations. No longer an unspeakable fate, cancer became a &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/should-we-abandon-the-idea-that-cancer-is-something-to-fight" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;battle to be fought&lt;/a&gt;, with patients cast as warriors, urged to ‘Fight Like Hell’. Drive through any major city in the United States, and you’ll pass billboards with slogans: ‘We Fight for You’; ‘Your Battle Begins Here.’ Cancer centres &lt;em&gt;recruit &lt;/em&gt;patients, urging them to &lt;em&gt;enlist&lt;/em&gt;. Public health campaigns preach constant vigilance against a lurking enemy needing to be stamped out before it takes root. What was once too fearsome to name became a call to action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many now worry the pendulum has swung too far. Overtreatment – intervening where it’s unlikely to help and likely to harm – has become a major problem in modern oncology. Take prostate cancer. In the US alone, more than 50,000 men are diagnosed each year with a low-risk instance of the disease. These cancers rarely spread, and observation is a safe approach, with outcomes equivalent to surgery or radiation. Yet more than half of patients still &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34108645/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;undergo&lt;/a&gt; aggressive treatment, risking incontinence, impotence and other harms – without clear benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;We treat not because it helps – but because the alternative feels like &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;giving up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar patterns play out in other cancers. More than 50,000 women in the US are diagnosed annually with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a non-invasive form of breast cancer with a low risk of progression. Yet nearly all undergo surgery, with a third receiving mastectomies. Trials have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39665585/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; that observation can be a safe alternative, but they struggled to recruit patients – and, even when they did, many crossed over to surgery. As one commentator &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29174412/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;, clinicians are conditioned to act, and patients have been ‘brought up to expect “cancer” to be removed.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But overtreatment doesn’t stop at early stage disease. In the US, it’s &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35993614/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that nearly 700,000 people are living with advanced cancer. For many, the final stretch of life will be marked by intervention. One in three will &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6521896/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;receive&lt;/a&gt; aggressive treatment in their last months, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27993817/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;one in five&lt;/a&gt; will get chemotherapy in their final weeks. These treatments rarely prolong life and almost always diminish its quality, bringing exhaustion, nausea, hospital stays and lost time with loved ones. Despite guidelines discouraging such practices, the default remains action. We treat not because it helps – but because the alternative feels like &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;giving up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a physician, I see this firsthand. Patients hear the word ‘cancer’ and brace for battle. Some tell me they’ll accept anything – however toxic – if it means getting rid of the disease. Even when the evidence supports watching and waiting, the very idea can feel like surrender. And even when the evidence supports palliative care, many still choose to ‘fight to the bitter end’. To &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9566.00081" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt; one patient: ‘Doing nothing is no choice&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;’ Clinicians, too, feel pressure to intervene. The urgency doesn’t come from disease biology – it comes from the weight of words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why some oncologists now &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35436144/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt; that we should &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30813118/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt; the ‘dreaded C-word’: removing the cancer label from low-risk cases like early breast and prostate cancers could spare patients unnecessary treatment. We’ve come full circle – but for the opposite reason. What Austin’s doctors withheld to preserve hope, today’s oncologists would withhold to prevent us from doing too much. It’s a tempting solution to a serious problem. Cancer overtreatment &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25847639/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;harms&lt;/a&gt; millions and drains billions from healthcare systems every year. But is &lt;em&gt;renaming&lt;/em&gt; really the answer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;o begin to unpack this, we can turn to Austin and his theory of speech acts. Imagine you’re diagnosed with a disease. It started with a yellowing toenail. Your doctor examines you, then says: ‘You have &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Disease X.’&lt;/span&gt; It’s slow growing, she explains, though it may spread. There’s a treatment, but it has side-effects. Some patients, she says, choose to live with &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Disease X.&lt;/span&gt; You consider your options, opt for treatment, and are cured. You never think of &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Disease X&lt;/span&gt; again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine a different diagnosis. This one began with a lump in your groin. Your doctor runs some tests, then breaks the news: ‘You have &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Disease Y.’&lt;/span&gt; You shudder at the words. She tries to reassure you: it’s slow growing but can spread over time. The treatment has side-effects. But many patients, she adds, find it hard to live with &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Disease Y.&lt;/span&gt; She refers you to a support group, where you hear of patients who fought &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Disease Y&lt;/span&gt; and won. You choose treatment and achieve remission. You remain an active member of the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Disease Y&lt;/span&gt; community. You see yourself as a &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Disease Y&lt;/span&gt; survivor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the difference between &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Disease X&lt;/span&gt; and Y? Between onychomycosis, a fungal toenail infection, and an indolent lymphoma, a slow-growing cancer of the lymph nodes? Yes, they differ in prognosis. But perhaps the most striking difference lies elsewhere. It lies in what Austin calls &lt;em&gt;illocutionary force&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illocutionary force is what words do in the very act of saying them – they create commitments, reshape roles, and influence identities. Take ‘I promise’: those two words don’t just express an intention; they create an obligation. Or take ‘You are guilty.’ Uttered by a judge, those words don’t just assign blame – they make you a criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;The fighter effect is a powerful driver of overtreatment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the words ‘You have cancer’ do more than simply state a medical fact. A cancer diagnosis, like a guilty verdict, carries special illocutionary force. It doesn’t just describe a condition; it imposes a new identity. In short, it makes you &lt;em&gt;a cancer patient&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And not just a patient – &lt;em&gt;a fighter&lt;/em&gt;. ‘Conquer Cancer.’ ‘Fight Like Hell.’ These slogans don’t just inspire; they instruct. They set expectations: show strength, not weakness; determination, not passivity; persistence, not surrender; action, not inaction. Cancer isn’t just a diagnosis – it’s a call to arms. We can give this special illocutionary force a name. Let’s call it &lt;em&gt;the fighter effect&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fighter effect is a powerful driver of overtreatment. It’s what leads men with low-risk prostate cancer to undergo unnecessary prostatectomies. It’s what drives women with indolent breast lesions to receive mastectomies they may not need. And it’s what pushes patients with advanced disease to trade precious time for ineffective treatments at the end of life. The word ‘cancer’ demands action. In the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23136314/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;words&lt;/a&gt; of one patient: ‘Something has got to be done.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognising cancer’s illocutionary force brings into focus two competing strategies for tackling overtreatment: &lt;em&gt;renaming &lt;/em&gt;versus &lt;em&gt;reframing.&lt;/em&gt; Proponents of renaming – those who argue that we should drop the ‘dreaded &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;C-word’&lt;/span&gt; and simply call early cancers something else – focus on blocking the immediate impact of cancer’s illocutionary force. By leaving the word unsaid, they aim to prevent the fighter effect from taking hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s a bit like building dams to stop flooding. It may protect some areas, but it doesn’t address the source of rising waters. The social and cultural currents that drive overtreatment remain, ready to surge again. To truly tackle overtreatment, we need a different strategy. Instead of building local dams, we must quell the rising waters. Rather than renaming the diagnosis, we must &lt;em&gt;reframe&lt;/em&gt; its force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;o reframe cancer’s illocutionary force means shifting the linguistic and social practices that give the word its power. It rejects the narrative that cancer demands a fight, aiming to disarm – rather than simply block – its illocutionary force. It creates space for treatment decisions to be guided by risks, benefits and patient preferences rather than by bellicose expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why reframe rather than simply rename? There are at least three compelling reasons. The first is that reframing targets the root cause of overtreatment. Studies &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24807866/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; that renaming early cancers with terms like IDLE (‘indolent lesion of epithelial origin’) may lead fewer patients to choose unnecessary treatment. But this is like trying to solve vaccine hesitancy by simply replacing the word ‘vaccine’ with a catchy acronym – say, BIBBLES (‘biological immunity boosting with bonafide, longitudinally established safety’).&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Clearly, that just skirts the issue. Renaming may block overtreatment in one instance, but it leaves the underlying misperception intact: that every cancer, regardless of risk, must be treated aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, renaming doesn’t just leave the misperception intact but reinforces it. Avoiding the term ‘cancer’ only feeds the narrative – shared by Austin’s doctors and critiqued by Sontag – that it’s something too terrible to name. Just as calling Voldemort He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named only intensifies his infamy, shying away from the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;C-word&lt;/span&gt; cements cancer’s power. Renaming some cancers, while reserving the word for cases where ‘fighting’ is deemed appropriate, ultimately reinforces the very expectations that efforts to tackle overtreatment ought to challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Reframing seeks to transform the norms and expectations around the diagnosis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason to prefer reframing is that it respects patient autonomy. Imagine you have an American friend, Amy, who hates zucchini. She’s not allergic or intolerant. She simply fears that eating zucchini will make her sick. Worried that Amy’s missing out on zucchini’s culinary delights, you prepare your finest ratatouille. Knowing she hates zucchini, you strategically tell her your ratatouille is made with ‘courgette’. (Schooled in American English, Amy is unfamiliar with zucchini’s British synonym.) She eats your ratatouille.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, it’s plain that you’ve deceived Amy. You’ve prevented her from making an autonomous decision about whether to eat your ratatouille given her preferences. Even if you believe her fear is baseless, your deceit isn’t justified. A better friend would help Amy understand that zucchini won’t harm her so she can confidently enjoy the vegetable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reframing aims to do just that: it addresses the fear directly, helping Amy see zucchini for what it really is. Renaming, by contrast, would have Amy eat ‘courgette’. This might be appropriate if she were your four-year-old daughter but it’s not appropriate for your friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9760953/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt; that renaming early cancers is paternalistic, infringing on patients’ right to make autonomous decisions. Members of the public have echoed these concerns, worrying that renaming feels deceitful. Though paternalism rightly raises red flags in modern medicine, it can sometimes be justified. Proponents of renaming defend it as a way to spare patients the emotional burden of the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;C-word,&lt;/span&gt; nudging them towards better choices. Yet this approach is ultimately flawed. It concedes that the fighter effect is problematic but does nothing to address it. As a result, patients whose conditions remain labelled ‘cancer’ are still subject to its full force, pushing them towards overly aggressive interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reframing offers a better path. Instead of sidestepping the problem, it seeks to transform the norms and expectations that surround the diagnosis. In so doing, it respects autonomy across the board – empowering all patients to make informed, proportionate decisions about their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;When patients discover that their so-called ‘lesion’ used to be called cancer, trust erodes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third reason to choose reframing is that it’s more robust. By robust, I mean resilient to shifting tides of medical practice, testing regimes and human behaviour that can undermine efforts to curb overtreatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider cancer screening. Recently, attempts to restrict mammography to women over 50 to prevent overdiagnosis and overtreatment sparked widespread controversy, with conflicting guidelines, professional disputes and media uproar – what became &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/07/27/mammogram-recommendations-preventive-services-task-force-overdiagnosis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dubbed&lt;/a&gt; ‘the mammography wars’. Even where restrictive screening guidelines are adopted, adherence is patchy, influenced by personal biases and patient pressures. Meanwhile, emerging technologies like blood-based cancer-detection tests introduce new avenues for overdiagnosis, further complicating efforts to address overtreatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renaming might seem more robust: if we can’t stop doctors from finding early cancers that don’t require treatment, we could at least change what they’re called. Replacing ‘cancer’ with ‘lesion’ or ‘IDLE’ might sidestep the fighter effect and thereby reduce unnecessary interventions. But this strategy, too, is fragile. As any physician knows, and as I’ve seen time and again in my own practice, such euphemisms inevitably prompt the further question. To borrow a line from the 1960 movie &lt;em&gt;Ocean’s Eleven&lt;/em&gt;: ‘Look, doc. Give it to me straight. Is this the big casino?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, when patients discover that their so-called ‘lesion’ used to be called cancer, trust erodes. And, in that moment of discovery, the full illocutionary force of the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;C-word&lt;/span&gt; re-enters – often with a vengeance. When Amy Googles ‘courgette’, she won’t be pleased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reframing is a more robust solution. Instead of relying on fragile euphemisms, it directly challenges the fighter effect – the underlying social forces that drive overtreatment. Rather than waging battles over labels, it aims to change the way we think and talk about cancer altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;hanging the way we think and talk about cancer might seem like a lofty, even impossible goal. But as Austin scholars have &lt;a href="https://www.amherstlecture.org/langton2015/langton2015_ALP.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pointed&lt;/a&gt; out, illocutionary forces are not immutable. They are shaped and sustained by social conventions. A promise carries weight because society enforces the expectation to keep one’s word. A guilty verdict gains significance through laws and institutions, and through how society views the crime. These are not set in stone. Change is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true of a cancer diagnosis. Shifting illocutionary force means changing the conventions that give it power – moving away from seeing every cancer as a battle to be won at all costs, and toward treating it like other diseases, where decisions carefully consider a patient’s preferences, along with the risks and benefits of different options. That shift requires action across many fronts. Doctors must reconsider how they present the diagnosis, replacing militarised metaphors with language that emphasises patient agency. Public health campaigns must move beyond combative imagery, crafting messages that inform and empower without resorting to fear to drive decisions. Cancer centres, research institutions and media outlets all have a role to play in dismantling norms that perpetuate the fighter effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Sontag, many have called for such changes. Austin’s insights lend new clarity to these calls, showing us why and how change should occur. Seeing the diagnosis of cancer as a speech act with powerful illocutionary force – capable of shaping norms, expectations, even identity – reveals that overtreatment can’t simply be contained by renaming specific cancers. Overtreatment isn’t just a medical issue, but a social and cultural one too. To change how we treat cancer, we must rethink the illocutionary force that surrounds the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sontag herself saw this clearly. She even lived through an important shift in that force. The unspeakable, ‘grave’ diagnosis that killed Austin had, by the time it claimed Sontag, become nameable, visible – even public. That was progress. But it wasn’t the liberation she’d &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;hoped for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Too many patients are convinced that stopping treatment or choosing palliation means surrender&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’d incisively critiqued cancer’s earlier metaphors of silence and despair, yet wasn’t immune to its newer ones. As her son David Rieff recounts in his memoir &lt;em&gt;Swimming in a Sea of Death&lt;/em&gt; (2008), following her diagnosis Sontag became a ‘militant propagandist for more rather than less treatment’, pursuing extraordinarily aggressive regimens – first for breast cancer, and later for the leukaemia that followed. Though ‘less is more’ captured her artistic sensibility, Rieff writes: ‘when it came to cancer treatments more was always better.’ By today’s standards, much of her treatment would be considered excessive – its toxicity likely contributing to the second cancer that ultimately claimed her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after her bone marrow transplant failed, Sontag refused to stop. She remained determined to ‘fight for her life to the very end’, rejecting any talk of palliation and pressing her doctors to continue. As her son movingly recalls, it was ‘the opposite of an easy death’ – a slow, painful end, ‘stripped of her dignity’ and ‘unreconciled to her own extinction’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a physician treating patients with blood cancers, I’ve seen how too many still face a similar fate, convinced that stopping treatment, choosing palliation – or even death itself – means surrender. As one patient with advanced cancer &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36573958/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;: ‘If I were to die, which I most likely will, then I’m a failure, I’m weak, I’m not a good fighter.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metaphors have changed – but their force endures. Though stigma has given way to slogans, true liberation means casting off these narratives altogether. It means reframing cancer’s illocutionary force so that it’s no longer a death sentence or a battle cry but a diagnosis – one that, like any other, demands deliberation, not action by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;We should all be free to attach our own meanings to the experience of illness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t to deny that a cancer diagnosis can be devastating. The words ‘You have cancer’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;often signal life-altering challenges ahead. Cancer remains a leading cause of death, claiming far too many lives – many younger than Sontag and even Austin, whose enduring contributions to &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/susan-sontag-was-a-monster-of-the-very-best-kind" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;literature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/how-the-thought-acts-of-the-oxford-don-j-l-austin-live-on" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; were tragically cut short by the disease. Early detection and effective treatment – sadly, unavailable to Austin and ultimately unsuccessful for Sontag – can and do saves lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet even with advances in therapy, most cancers remain difficult to cure, and treatments remain long and arduous. In the face of such hardships, some might see the fighter effect as a source of strength, helping them endure a difficult treatment cycle or pursue early intervention. Some patients may choose to embrace the identity of ‘fighter’; others of ‘traveller’; others of something entirely different. We should all be free to attach our own meanings to the experience of illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To argue for reframing cancer’s illocutionary force is not to deny the gravity of the disease, the benefits of early treatment, or the hardships faced by patients. It’s to question whether the expectation to ‘fight’ should be baked into the very act of diagnosing cancer. Patients already grapple with complex decisions – navigating treatment options, weighing side-effects, and considering what it all means. They should not be further burdened by pressures to ‘fight’ because of the force of words. Decoupling the fighter effect from the cancer diagnosis allows patients to make their own informed choices – choices that weigh risks and benefits, not words. Only by shifting these norms can we achieve the kind of liberation that Sontag envisioned – it’s the only way to truly ‘de-mythicise’ cancer so that patients are free to shape their own identities and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Austin reminds us, we &lt;em&gt;do things &lt;/em&gt;with words. Words have the power to create norms, establish expectations, and shape identities. This power is rooted in linguistic and social conventions – conventions that, as Austin and Sontag well knew, are never fixed. In Austin’s day, cancer was an unspeakable diagnosis; in Sontag’s, it became a battle cry. Both were shaped by the language of their time. And both, in different ways, suffered under its weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we stand at a different moment. Patients with cancer needn’t suffer in silence – but neither should they be summoned to war. If we are to carry forward Austin’s insights and realise Sontag’s vision, we must change not just the volume but the force of the word ‘cancer’. It shouldn’t be whispered. Nor shouted. It should be spoken clearly and calmly – so that patients can face a cancer diagnosis with autonomy, unburdened by expectation. To truly tackle overtreatment, we shouldn’t avoid the word ‘cancer’. We should transform what it means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Aeon</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 10:00:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQTUxRTVNKRE1GallMOXFQNVBMNzFpRFZSbzNqWnQ5ZU9FOElVbXBSNGxSSkJCdnFGcmF4cXZSV3c2MXJwRzF1eW9uYXVGNkc3M19sMXU4LThlLU1ubkxBV0FDLXJLRzVmNUM3Ykd1OHBjQlV3OV9kUGNSa2xld3JwYkdIWnZ3ZGMwMXJCUkdRZ21vZw</guid></item><item><title>Benadryl的危害大于好处吗？ -《纽约时报》 | Does Benadryl Do More Harm Than Good? - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE04bXBMMThhLUtnZ3FLVkYyM3ZjbEVQbGswOXJ5UHp6T0VGS2hyU01vRTV3V0FHaGRtRFlQaGc0SmladFlXSDdROS1JeU5aNW9uaFE0OTd2THhuTWxWUGlHUHJfRFpxZ3VVWFRZd0xFakFLeFF6?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 09:00:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE04bXBMMThhLUtnZ3FLVkYyM3ZjbEVQbGswOXJ5UHp6T0VGS2hyU01vRTV3V0FHaGRtRFlQaGc0SmladFlXSDdROS1JeU5aNW9uaFE0OTd2THhuTWxWUGlHUHJfRFpxZ3VVWFRZd0xFakFLeFF6</guid></item><item><title>由于纽约市敦促接种疫苗，全国麻疹病例达到33年来的最高水平- Gothamist | Measles cases reach 33-year high nationwide as NYC urges vaccination - Gothamist</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQWkt0VU9aVE14bG1pTEUxWExGcnd5MUp4TVpWWXJmcnV4ekhXZVRFTHJ2dktBWGxlMDJMOS16dExuT0pPb3JRdVNjbTZRWnpsaXk5SWNtWmdMdGg4Qi13YlQxSGxEZnpIRFNSQXBhV1BiazZqS2FvZ25Rak1peGxFa3lTYUFIMEdNZGpmbjJjSEhBUEt1TWwxd2tmdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="c0fvt"&gt;New York City hasn’t had any measles outbreaks yet this year, even as cases nationwide hit a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;33-year high&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; But individual cases continue to be reported and officials continue to urge vaccination and caution in a city that helped drive a major spike in cases in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="92esc"&gt;Seven cases of measles have been reported in the five boroughs so far this year, with the most recent confirmed in early July, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;city health department updates&lt;/a&gt;.

Though they're not miracle cures, several foods may provide relief next time you have a headache or migraine, in addition to maintaining your &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/summer-hydration-daily-water-requirements/" target="_self"&gt;hydration&lt;/a&gt;, exercise routine, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/best-sleep-tracker/" target="_self"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; and managing &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/7-strategies-to-reduce-stress-and-feel-more-joy-today/" target="_self"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;"The most important thing I tell patients is that migraines are highly individualized," says &lt;a href="https://somerset-medical.com/about/" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Nicholas Church&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified member of the American Board of Family Medicine and the American Academy of Family Physicians. "What helps one person may not help another, and what's a trigger for one might be therapeutic for someone else."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We spoke with doctors and dietitians to help you narrow down which foods may help with headache symptoms. They also discussed which foods to avoid to prevent headaches in the first place.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Omega-3-rich foods like walnuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I recommend &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/health-benefits-omega-3-foods-add-into-diet-with-these-foods/" target="_self"&gt;omega-3-rich&lt;/a&gt; fish, such as salmon, mackerel and sardines," says Church. "These fish are high in anti-inflammatory fats (EPA and DHA), which can reduce inflammation throughout the body, including in the vascular system and brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing a &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n1448" target="_self"&gt;2021 randomized controlled trial&lt;/a&gt;, Church explains that because migraines are believed to involve inflammatory and vascular changes in the body, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-omega-3-supplements-for-a-healthy-heart/" target="_self"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; may help reduce their frequency or intensity when eaten regularly. "The study's findings also align with earlier data showing that omega-3s help regulate prostaglandins, which play a role in headache inflammation," says Church. Prostaglandins are hormone-like substances that impact bodily functions like inflammation, pain and menstrual cramps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish also contain &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/feel-low-on-energy-try-these-11-vitamin-d-rich-foods/" target="_self"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, coenzyme Q10 and B vitamins like riboflavin, which support healthy brain metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiran Campbell, a registered dietitian nutritionist at &lt;a href="https://www.mynetdiary.com/bio-kcampbell.html" target="_self"&gt;MyNetDiary&lt;/a&gt;, also mentions a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831323014503#sec5" target="_self"&gt;2024 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; revealing that omega-3 fatty acids can reduce the frequency, duration and severity of migraines. She adds that plant-based sources include chia seeds, walnuts, flaxseed and algae oil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example foods:&lt;/strong&gt; salmon, mackerel, sardines, chia seeds, walnuts, flaxseed and algae oil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia and flax seeds are great sources of omega-3s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;mikroman6/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Magnesium-rich foods like spinach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uws.edu/faculty/byname/daniel_redwood/" target="_self"&gt;Daniel Redwood&lt;/a&gt;, the director of Human Nutrition and Functional Medicine at the University of Western States, explains, "Attention to the potential importance of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/different-types-of-magnesium/" target="_self"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; in migraine grew in prominence with the discovery (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2584000/" target="_self"&gt;Ramadan, 1989&lt;/a&gt;) that people with migraines had lower levels of this mineral in their red blood cells, serum and brain tissue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Daidone, medical director at &lt;a href="https://trueselfrecovery.com/" target="_self"&gt;True Self Recovery&lt;/a&gt;, seconds this, stating that food rich in magnesium -- like pumpkin seeds, spinach and avocado -- may reduce the severity and occurrence of migraines. He cites a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8912646/" target="_self"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; examining the potential connection between magnesium deficiency and migraine, which describes how magnesium deficiency is implicated in migraine attacks due to processes like cortical spreading depression, oxidative stress, neurotransmitter imbalance and electrolyte imbalance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although clinical evidence of the acute dietary magnesium deficiency as a direct migraine trigger remains limited, scientists are investigating the involvement of intra- and extracellular magnesium levels in migraine pathogenesis," Daidone explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Schonze Del Pozo, a board-certified internal medicine physician and medical director at &lt;a href="https://eastsacconcierge.com" target="_self"&gt;East Sacramento Concierge&lt;/a&gt;, states that many of the patients she sees for headaches and migraines are &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/5-best-magnesium-supplements/" target="_self"&gt;deficient in magnesium&lt;/a&gt;. She also cites a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22426836/" target="_self"&gt;2012 study&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Neural Transmission entitled "Why all migraine patients should be treated with magnesium." As a result, she recommends a healthy diet of magnesium-rich dark leafy greens like spinach, kale, broccoli and Swiss chard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example foods: &lt;/strong&gt;pumpkin seeds, spinach and avocado, kale, broccoli and Swiss chard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Ginger&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many swear by ginger as a way to help with migraines," states &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drknobel/?originalSubdomain=uk" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Maria Knöbel&lt;/a&gt;, a general practitioner and medical director of &lt;a href="https://medicalcert.co.uk/about/" target="_self"&gt;Medical Cert UK&lt;/a&gt;. "Studies have proven that ginger reduces nausea and can decrease the inflammation that leads to migraine pain. Ginger has helped patients during my practice, whether they take it as ginger tea or in supplement form." She references a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23657930/" target="_self"&gt;2014 study&lt;/a&gt; that found ginger powder to be as effective as the medication sumatriptan in treating acute migraine attacks, but with fewer side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger tea may be especially beneficial because, Knöbel states, "It's important to drink enough water, as well as eat ginger. Drinking enough water might stop your migraine from getting any worse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Church also recommends &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/dont-miss-out-on-the-7-hidden-health-benefits-of-ginger/" target="_self"&gt;ginger because it contains&lt;/a&gt; natural anti-inflammatory compounds like gingerol. "I've had patients find relief from migraines or migraine-related nausea using ginger tea, powder or chews," he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29768938/#link={%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29768938/%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%222019%20study%22}" target="_self"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; also found that 400mg of ginger extract, in addition to 100mg of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ketoprofen, may help treat migraine attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger tea combines the benefits of ginger with the hydration of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Muhamad Zulkarnaen/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Nuts and seeds like pumpkin seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Another group of foods I recommend are nuts and seeds, including almonds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and walnuts," Church states. "Like leafy greens, these are rich in magnesium, and some also provide &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/vitamin-e-health-benefits-nutritional-sources-and-drawbacks/" target="_self"&gt;vitamin E&lt;/a&gt;, which has been shown to help with menstrual migraines and migraines with aura." A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4359851/#sec3" target="_self"&gt;2015 study&lt;/a&gt; reflected this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example foods: &lt;/strong&gt;almonds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and walnuts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Cinnamon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cinnamon contains a high amount of antioxidants that may also reduce headache frequency," Campbell explains. "Stir it into your morning oatmeal or tea, or bake it into muffins and breads." She cites a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32638445/" target="_self"&gt;2020 trial&lt;/a&gt;, stating, "Studies suggest that cinnamon supplementation may lower inflammation, cutting down on migraine frequency, severity and duration."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antioxidants in cinnamon may help treat headaches and migraines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;FreshSplash/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Foods rich in vitamin B2, like eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A well-known [1998] &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/wnl.50.2.466?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" target="_self"&gt;randomized controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; found that 400 mg of riboflavin daily significantly reduced migraine frequency and severity over a three-month period," Church says. Though this high dose usually comes from supplementation, riboflavin-rich foods support the same metabolic processes in migraine prevention. These foods can include eggs, dairy and lean meats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Riboflavin is essential for mitochondrial energy production, and many researchers believe that migraines stem in part from dysfunction in energy metabolism within brain cells," Church adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redwood adds, "There exists a small but promising body of research on the effectiveness of some nutritional supplements for migraines, especially riboflavin (vitamin B2), coenzyme Q10 and magnesium. The first research-based indicator of riboflavin's potential as a migraine treatment appeared in a small 1946 article by a medical physician, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, which reported dramatic effectiveness from what would now be considered low-dose B2 supplements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33779525/" target="_self"&gt;2022 systematic review&lt;/a&gt; and meta-analysis found that supplementation of 400mg/day of vitamin B2 for three months affected the duration, frequency and pain score of migraine attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example foods:&lt;/strong&gt; Eggs, dairy and lean meats &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Turmeric &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curcumin is the active compound in turmeric and, according to Campbell, is "high in antioxidant power and shines especially when paired with omega-3s." To add it to your diet, consider sprinkling it into smoothies, curries or teas. Campbell references a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32727335/" target="_self"&gt;2021 trial&lt;/a&gt; that concluded, "Present findings revealed that n-3 fatty acids and curcumin co-supplementation can be suggested as a promising new approach in migraine headache management." However, more studies are needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined with omega-3s, turmeric may help with migraine headache management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Rawlstock/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Whole grains like brown rice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Church mentions that whole grains like quinoa, brown rice and oats may also be beneficial since they "provide a steady release of glucose, preventing &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/what-can-your-blood-sugar-tell-you-i-tracked-mine-for-a-month-to-find-out/" target="_self"&gt;blood sugar crashes&lt;/a&gt; that can trigger headaches, and are good sources of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/high-fiber-foods-to-improve-your-digestion/" target="_self"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, B vitamins and trace minerals." He cites a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9846638/#abstract1" target="_self"&gt;2023 cross-sectional study&lt;/a&gt; of 12,710 participants with all data collected from a 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. It found that for every 10 grams of fiber added to the diet, there was an 11% reduction in the odds of having severe headaches or migraines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By providing magnesium, iron, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/8-science-backed-reasons-you-should-take-vitamin-b/" target="_self"&gt;B vitamins&lt;/a&gt;, whole grains support brain health, oxygen delivery and a stable glucose supply, which are all relevant to migraine prevention," concludes Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37216708/" target="_self"&gt;2023 comprehensive review&lt;/a&gt; also found that curcumin is a promising candidate for preventing and controlling migraines due to its anti‑inflammatory, antioxidative, anti-protein aggregate and analgesic effects. However, additional studies are needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example foods:&lt;/strong&gt; quinoa, brown rice and oats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. Water-rich foods like watermelon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/drkimberlyidoko/?hl=en" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Kimberly Idoko&lt;/a&gt;, a developmental neurobiologist and board-certified neurologist, reveals that dehydration can also trigger headaches, which is why staying hydrated can significantly improve migraine treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/eat-your-way-to-peak-hydration-with-these-6-electrolyte-rich-foods/" target="_self"&gt;Water-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; like cucumber, watermelon and citrus fruits also help you stay hydrated," adds Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent dehydration-caused headaches or migraines, enjoy more water-rich foods like watermelon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Anucha Muphasa/500px/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Foods that may trigger headaches or migraines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chocolate, cheese and alcohol:&lt;/strong&gt; "In one &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17403039/" target="_self"&gt;[2007] study&lt;/a&gt; of over 500 migraine sufferers, 44% reported at least one food as a trigger.

Over a 5-year period, doctors at a neurology clinic in Israel treated 36 children and adolescents (average age 9) with severe daily or near-daily headaches who drank an average of 11 quarts of cola drinks per week," says Redwood. "At the end of a gradual withdrawal period (because too speedy a withdrawal can trigger even worse headaches), 33 of these 36 young people were headache-free, a truly stunning result. Nearly all cola drinks contain substantial amounts of caffeine (&lt;a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00414.x" target="_self"&gt;Chou and Bell, 2007&lt;/a&gt;)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: 11 quarts of cola per week is extreme, and the average person doesn't consume this much caffeine. Moderate caffeine intake is still OK, according to Amelia Ti, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator in New York City who is also part of CNET's medical review board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when it comes to caffeine, Church notes, "&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/cutting-back-on-coffee-is-hard-tips-for-making-it-easier/" target="_self"&gt;Caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, used strategically, can enhance the absorption of pain relievers and constrict dilated blood vessels in the brain, which may ease migraine pain.

Administered via injection just twice a year, it works by targeting the structural protein (capsid) of the HIV, blocking its ability to replicate in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenacapavir was approved in 2022 to treat certain HIV infections, and in trials for prevention, it was found to dramatically reduce the risk of infection and provide almost total protection against HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;WHO’s official recommendation&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Meg Doherty, director of WHO’s Department of Global HIV, Hepatitis and Sexually Transmitted Infections Programmes, said in a news briefing, “These new recommendations are designed for real-world use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO is working closely with countries and partners to support the implementation.” Doherty added, “The first recommendation is that a long-acting injectable, lenacapavir, should be offered as an additional prevention choice for people at risk for HIV and as part of combination prevention. With that, we call it a strong recommendation with moderate to high certainty of the evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second recommendation in the guidelines is that rapid diagnostic tests, like at-home tests, can be used to screen someone for HIV when they are starting, continuing, or stopping long-acting medication to prevent infection, called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health leaders, including WHO’s Director‑General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, touted lenacapavir as “the next best thing” to an HIV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This latest endorsement complements existing WHO‑approved prevention methods – daily oral PrEP, bi‑monthly cabotegravir injections, and the dapivirine vaginal ring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO also streamlined HIV testing protocols to support injectable PrEP uptake in community settings, pharmacies, and telehealth contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why a twice‑yearly injection might prove to be a good shot&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Adherence and convenience:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daily pill demands consistency, which many at‑risk individuals struggle to maintain.

It is spread by contact with certain bodily fluids of a person with HIV, most commonly during unprotected sex (sex without a condom or HIV medicine to prevent or treat HIV), or through sharing injection drug equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If left untreated, HIV can lead to the disease AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within a few weeks of HIV infection, flu-like symptoms such as fever, sore throat, and fatigue can occur. Then the disease is usually asymptomatic until it progresses to AIDS. AIDS symptoms include weight loss, fever or night sweats, fatigue, and recurrent infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no existing cure for AIDS, but strict adherence to antiretroviral regimens (ARVs) can dramatically slow the disease's progress as well as prevent secondary infections and complications. Vaccines for HIV are under trial, but no effective vaccine has been developed to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2025, the global fight against HIV/AIDS faced a significant setback with the United States of America's decision to halt foreign aid funding for HIV prevention and treatment programs. This move, part of a broader 90-day pause in US foreign development assistance, sent shockwaves through the international health community only a week ago, raising alarms about a potential resurgence of the epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO’s endorsement of twice‑yearly lenacapavir marks a transformative moment, especially amidst the looming concerns regarding the funding cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gilead Sciences, maker of lenacapavir, recently announced that it has reached an agreement with the nonprofit Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to supply lenacapavir for HIV prevention at no profit to the company. Under this agreement, Gilead’s pricing reflects only the cost of producing and delivering lenacapavir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gilead Chairman and CEO Daniel O’Day said in a news release, “We are providing the medicine at no profit to Gilead, and in enough supply to reach up to two million people in low- and lower-middle-income countries ahead of generic lenacapavir becoming available.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Sands, executive director of the Global Fund, said in the news release, lenacapavir can “fundamentally change the trajectory of the HIV epidemic,” but only if it reaches the people who need it most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per him, “Our ambition is to reach 2 million people with long-acting PrEP. But we can only do that if the world steps up with the resources required. This is a pivotal moment — not just for the fight against HIV, but for the fundamental principle that lifesaving innovations must reach those who need them most — whoever they are, and wherever they live.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If scaled equitably and thoughtfully, this intervention could reshape the landscape of HIV prevention, moving us closer to a world without AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Actor Nargis Fakhri Reveals 9‑Day Water Fast Twice a Year to Get ‘Snatched’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 05:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>您不需要重物来锻炼肌肉-如果您只有轻物，请遵循科学支持的规则- Fit&amp;Well | You don’t need heavy weights to build muscle—here’s the science-backed rule to follow if all you have are light weights - Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAJBVV95cUxQUUdBa1d4REVrZEhMOUZsTUZwaExEVXBaU1FacFd0REpQdGh1ejViNFB1OFB0RkNmR1hhcTNZNFlCdjFON3h6RFI1bW5iRWZnWDMzTW1aY0tnZHd3UHpzYlNDWEY2ZU1FdDAwMUdZWVFnX1lPRzlTSjNScDE3c0dnaTZoZzFFYjZLc2tDR0ItZEVDdDNhaDk0dWlkRkZaNWl6V0hLNVlHMC1UVmZ4UG5zQlBVZm5Ka2pfOFFpT3d0dVpBOTdlbXlWTEJsckVXUFhMeWxwRG1VRkJKT1djaV9vN2VTRWhqUjQ0ZGs2MFh3SU1CNGVtbmI0b1dOSk02STFi?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to build strength but find yourself gazing forlornly at a pair of light dumbbells, wondering how they can help, I have good news. Research suggests that it doesn’t matter how light or heavy you lift, so long as you lift to the point of near failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the lesson recently shared by certified trainer, Technogym ambassador and friend of the show James Stirling, also known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/london_fitness_guy/?hl=en" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/london_fitness_guy/?hl=en" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;London Fitness Guy&lt;/a&gt; to his 1.4 million followers on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pointing to one small &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25853914/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25853914/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;2015 study&lt;/a&gt; on 18 well-trained young men, Stirling wrote that lifting light weights for 25-35 reps or heavy weights for 8-12 reps produced a similar muscle growth response so long as “the set was taken to the point where only 1-2 reps were left in the tank”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people say heavy [weights build more muscle] but the research says both work, as long as you’re pushing close to failure,” he added, while pictured wielding a heavy and light dumbbell in the accompanying video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research&lt;/em&gt;, did however, find high-load resistance training to be superior for maximizing strength adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stirling’s assertion neatly aligns with another &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sportrxiv.org/index.php/server/preprint/view/484/version/620" target="_blank" data-url="https://sportrxiv.org/index.php/server/preprint/view/484/version/620" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;more recent preprint&lt;/a&gt; by the same lead author that was published last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brad J Schoenfeld and his fellow authors found that lifting weights within two reps of the point of failure, known as two &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/news/reps-in-reserve" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/news/reps-in-reserve"&gt;reps in reserve&lt;/a&gt; (RiR), was the winning formula to build muscular endurance &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-C3REsZc7oivv3wHoC7m7kW" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-C3REsZc7oivv3wHoC7m7kW slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better still, the researchers, led by author Tom Hermann, found just two 30-minute sessions of resistance training a week is plenty to build size and strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-do-you-know-when-you-re-close-to-failure"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How do you know when you’re close to failure? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifting close to failure taps into the principle of progressive overload, in which you consistently challenge yourself to lift near your maximum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeating this process week upon week forces your muscles to adapt and become stronger. Muscle fibres grow, ligaments and tendons become more resilient, and strength increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how do you know for sure when you're close to failure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stirling has two telltale signs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The weight starts slowing down when you’re lifting it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It feels like your muscles are on fire.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think of it like your car’s fuel warning light,” he writes. “Stop just before you're empty, not when you’re cruising.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-use-stirling-s-light-weights-workout-to-build-full-body-muscle"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Use Stirling’s light weights workout to build full-body muscle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this point, I asked Stirling for one of his favorite full-body workouts that can be practised with whatever weights you have at your disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His session includes seven exercises, four of them combined into two supersets to keep muscles under increased tension if you’re making the most of light dumbbells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Perform three sets of each exercise, working close to failure on each,” Stirling tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;. Rest for one minute between sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the supersets, perform one set of exercise A, then move straight onto exercise B. After you finish the set of exercise B, rest for one minute, then return to exercise A and continue that pattern until you’ve completed three sets of each exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the moves, with either a link to our exercise guide, or a guide on our former sister site &lt;em&gt;Coach&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just remember that you should take each set close to failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That will ensure enough load to build muscle, regardless of rep range, making this workout convenient if you want to try it at home or if equipment is limited,” says Stirling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ensure you follow the principle of progressive overload,” he adds. “When it feels comfortable, increase the weights. Aim for small progressions in reps or the weights you lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Or add more volume each week by increasing the number of sets you complete.”&lt;/p&gt;

A key part of that vitality? Walking. But not just any kind of walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Japanese, it seems that walking is not casual, but rather it's a structured, intentional form of movement known as interval walking training (IWT)- also popularly known as Japanese Walking. This form of workout, which alternates between fast and slow walking, has been quietly reshaping the health of aging adults for nearly two decades. Backed by science and now enjoying a TikTok-fueled revival, IWT is helping people one step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Not just another trend&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 20 years ago, Hiroshi Nose and his team in Japan published a paper that put high-intensity interval walking on the map. Through their study, they found out that middle-aged and older adults who practiced IWT had lower blood pressure, stronger thigh muscles, and improved aerobic capacity compared to those who walked at a steady, moderate pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the routine itself is not very difficult. Walk fast for three minutes, then slow down for three. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeat this cycle for a total of 30 minutes a day, at least four days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shizue Masuki, a co-author of the study and professor at Shinshu University Graduate School of Medicine in Matsumoto, explained, “One of the most surprising findings was that IWT markedly increased physical fitness and decreased blood pressure after the 5-month intervention, whereas these improvements were not observed in the moderate-intensity continuous walking group.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, after the 2007 study, many more follow-up studies have continued to affirm the preliminary findings. A 2023 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37200321/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;involving people with Type 2 diabetes and another in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2025.1544831/full" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2024 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;focusing on adults over 65 both found that IWT improved cholesterol levels, body mass index (BMI), flexibility, and cardiorespiratory endurance compared to control groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have reiterated time and again that walking puts healthy stress on the heart, which in turn increases its capacity to function better and decreases resting blood pressure. And once the body calms, you will feel an improvement in your blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Masuki, other benefits of the technique have shown up in additional studies by her team, including improvements in sleep, mood, cognitive function, and symptoms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mental health benefits of walking in open spaces are well-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/time-spent-in-nature-can-boost-physical-and-mental-well-being/#:~:text=%E2%80%9C%5BTime%20spent%20outdoors%5D%20provides,Photo:%20iStock/wdstock" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. It lowers blood pressure, reduces cortisol, improves focus and sleep, and helps regulate mood. Further, IWT is time efficient too. So for people who don't have much time to slide in an hour-long workout at the gym, this simple walking technique can help them improve their health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 01:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6gFBVV95cUxPaHIyWU9WRHZRM0NFcUEweDZJd3h6QloyYWlhMFI2RjlSMkt5NHF4Z0hJeVJCanhHNXdHOFRGdEVnMmxsUzFSNG9xdzdyR1dyWXVyNHRnS3Jsd2NBX3dHLVhaTWRtOVF0eFg3eGh2UTBmNWVXMi1JQkxIQmVIZnhjS1FoY3Jack5NRkpFLW8yM0xESUxHZUNreWhab25HandiNTBSVXlxRzRJUlpTSGJOamZLanJRYUxrdGxHTmZ2Y2xycXRlN2Y3eDNMTHRPMDhaeExTdjctNjl1RGQ0cWJDbWN0MzVzMXNCSXc</guid></item><item><title>根据专家的说法，如果您与便秘作斗争，下午5点后应避免的5种食物- AOL.com | 5 Foods to Avoid After 5 P.M.

EatingWell design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Key Points&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Choosing the right foods to eat before bedtime can help prevent constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Avoid foods high in fat and low in fiber to improve digestion, especially at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Establishing a consistent night routine can help improve bowel regularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re already dealing with constipation, the last thing you need is a nighttime snack that makes things worse. What you eat before bed can have a &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053282/how-to-digest-food-faster/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:surprising impact on your digestion;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;surprising impact on your digestion&lt;/a&gt;, and in some cases, it might be the reason you wake up feeling even more backed up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 16% of adults in the U.S. suffer from constipation, and that number doubles after the age of 60. While fiber and hydration are key for keeping things moving, certain foods—especially when eaten right before sleep—can slow digestion even more. We spoke with digestive experts to learn which foods are the worst to eat before bed if you have constipation, plus what to choose instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. High-Fat Foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re prone to constipation, it’s best to steer clear of high-fat foods before bed—think cheese, processed snacks or heavy takeout,” says &lt;a href="https://www.samanthadevitonutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Samantha DeVito, M.S., RD, CDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Samantha DeVito, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;. “These types of meals can slow digestion and may make things worse overnight when your gut naturally slows down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even large servings of nut butters before bed can be problematic, according to &lt;a href="https://www.goodgutnutritionist.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kerry Conlon, M.S., RD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kerry Conlon, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian specializing in digestive diseases. “Although they are healthy fats, eating too much nut butter before bed can slow down gastric emptying, which means food moves through your digestive system slowly, which can lead to constipation,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your digestive system follows a circadian rhythm, or 24-hour clock, meaning it’s more active during the day and winds down at night. Eating foods that are high in fat too close to bedtime can delay stomach emptying and &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-before-in-the-morning-to-help-you-poop-11718405" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduce the natural morning urge;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;reduce the natural morning urge&lt;/a&gt; to go. Instead, choose lighter, high-fiber meals in the evening to support regularity and work &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; your body’s natural rhythm—not against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re used to having a nightcap or a glass of wine before bed, you may want to rethink it if you’re not as regular as you’d like to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol acts as a diuretic by lowering levels of vasopressin—a hormone that helps your kidneys hold on to water. When vasopressin is suppressed, your body loses more fluid through frequent urination, which can lead to mild dehydration. Dehydration can cause harder, drier stools that are more difficult to pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking alcohol can also &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-can-disturb-your-sleep-8551851" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:disrupt your sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;disrupt your sleep&lt;/a&gt;, says &lt;a href="https://www.manhattangastroenterology.com/dr-mikhail-yakubov/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mikhail Yakubov, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mikhail Yakubov, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified gastroenterologist at Manhattan Gastroenterology. “Sleep and digestion are closely linked through your body’s circadian rhythm,” says Yakubov. “Poor sleep quality or insufficient rest can slow gut motility, making it harder to have a morning bowel movement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Refined Grains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047875/what-are-refined-carbs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Refined grains;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Refined grains&lt;/a&gt; like white bread, white pasta, white rice and desserts may be a comforting nighttime snack, but they can make things worse if you’re feeling backed up. These foods are stripped of most of their fiber during processing, which means they lack the bulk that helps move stool through the digestive tract. “Fiber acts as a broom sweeping through to help keep us regular and remove waste products,” says &lt;a href="https://phxvegandietitian.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rhyan Geiger, RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rhyan Geiger, RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Highly processed foods that are low in fiber may contribute to slower digestion and movement through the system, causing constipation,” Conlon adds. Instead, opt for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-fiber-fruits-to-eat-11747635" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high-fiber fruits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high-fiber fruits&lt;/a&gt; like kiwi or dates or high-fiber grains such as oats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Protein-Boosted Snacks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is an essential nutrient that everyone needs, but not all proteins are created equal—especially when it comes to digestion. “Many of the high-protein snacks on the market—such as protein bars, cookies, pretzels and chips—contain protein isolates and sugar substitutes that can contribute to uncomfortable bloating and gas in people with sluggish digestion,” says Conlon&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these foods are a convenient way to increase your protein intake, they may cause constipation in some people. Conlon recommends &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-protein-blueberry-peanut-butter-chia-pudding-11713745" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chia pudding;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;chia pudding&lt;/a&gt; as a high-protein, high-fiber snack to enjoy before bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Dairy Products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dairy-based snacks like yogurt, milk and cheese might contribute to constipation if you’re sensitive to lactose or have a tendency toward sluggish digestion,” says DeVito. These foods contain protein and fat that take longer to break down in your digestive system. While slower digestion can help keep you feeling full longer for some people, it can be challenging if you already struggle with regular bowel movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice that dairy products tend to leave you feeling backed up, especially in the evening, it’s a good idea to limit how much you consume before bed. Choosing &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290640/lactose-intolerance-symptoms-causes-what-to-eat-and-more/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lactose-free alternatives;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;lactose-free alternatives&lt;/a&gt; or plant-based options can be easier on your digestive system and may help support smoother digestion overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Things to Do Before Bed to Help Reduce Constipation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a light snack rich in fiber and fluids. &lt;/strong&gt;DeVito recommends berries with probiotic-rich kefir or a small bowl of oatmeal with chia seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a nighttime routine for good sleep. &lt;/strong&gt;“A consistent sleep schedule helps. Your gut thrives on routine just like the rest of your body,” says DeVito. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day to help maintain bowel regularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice gentle movement. &lt;/strong&gt;Conlon recommends some form of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/evening-activity-to-help-you-poop-in-the-morning-11701702" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:light movement after dinner;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;light movement after dinner&lt;/a&gt; to encourage digestion, such as walking. Studies show that higher levels of activity are associated with a lower risk of constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat consistent meals and snacks. &lt;/strong&gt;“The timing of your meals matters when it comes to bowel regularity,” says Conlon. Avoid eating too close to bedtime and aim to spread meals and snacks evenly throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as there are things that can relieve constipation, there are some things that could be making it worse, particularly things you consume before bed. Much like your sleep, your digestion operates on a circadian rhythm, with things naturally slowing down at nighttime. Eating foods that slow digestion or drinking alcohol before bed can worsen constipation and leave you feeling even more backed up in the morning. Since everyone responds differently, some trial and error may be needed to find which foods are best to avoid before bed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-to-avoid-after-5pm-for-constipation-11770468" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 01:01:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiYkFVX3lxTE5WZFBKV0NYbGQzbmJlWl9DTzJyUmJaY0syNFJJaEdxaFNMOVByQ1JqVE00QjRhZnd1R1dMTmhFaEJ1bHhpYmtaTVdIcTRUUDFKd2Q3eEtNVDlfZV9NeUFPY0p3</guid></item><item><title>由于疫苗覆盖率不足，欧洲麻疹病例飙升-英国《金融时报》 | Measles cases soar in Europe as vaccine coverage falls short - Financial Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTFBVeDQ5UDYzX0V4YXJqTG5Wa2FfdUd3RzAxY0RhbjdEY1B4eDZwMTN4N3BlUkVsR1pOZThVb0RCbnJOOWlMZlpPT2xrMHd3dkNQdDJXVzVpdzA1T3V2MWxuMmNEQTVyVTltS3FScVdoS1o?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="o-grid-row details-section o3-type-body-base css-pmzbjb"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Complete digital access to quality analysis and expert insights, complemented with our award-winning Weekend Print edition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Financial Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 00:55:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBVeDQ5UDYzX0V4YXJqTG5Wa2FfdUd3RzAxY0RhbjdEY1B4eDZwMTN4N3BlUkVsR1pOZThVb0RCbnJOOWlMZlpPT2xrMHd3dkNQdDJXVzVpdzA1T3V2MWxuMmNEQTVyVTltS3FScVdoS1o</guid></item><item><title>联合国估计， 2024年有1400万儿童未接种单一疫苗-美联社新闻 | 14 million children did not receive a single vaccine in 2024, UN estimates - AP News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxOellWU2VYYWd0M0NuY3hMOXBGT3NNRXBIc0ZBMmZlUWJ1bGYtaElOVW54U3BLaUh6aDNNQk1JWnZkZVFZeWFWTTNUcDZmeWtzYjJqOTBJRWg5QnlDTUhsUHVLRzRmMXBxd0NSRFNpc0t1bDlwWWJVd3NFUDFyRVp0NUlpVlRURUp5NHRpVkVpRkF1OUNsZkRET2dmb2dtN0xL?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 00:42:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxOellWU2VYYWd0M0NuY3hMOXBGT3NNRXBIc0ZBMmZlUWJ1bGYtaElOVW54U3BLaUh6aDNNQk1JWnZkZVFZeWFWTTNUcDZmeWtzYjJqOTBJRWg5QnlDTUhsUHVLRzRmMXBxd0NSRFNpc0t1bDlwWWJVd3NFUDFyRVp0NUlpVlRURUp5NHRpVkVpRkF1OUNsZkRET2dmb2dtN0xL</guid></item><item><title>新报告警告说，全球有超过1400万儿童从未接受过任何疫苗接种 | More than 14 million children worldwide have never received a single dose of any vaccine, new report warns - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxQX2l6M2x5d2NwbnFWaTg0NEwydmFxUUNaSGdORkRycXc4S2t6dUtLRmlvWU9vb0pWWERHV0lrY1lDWTEwaWtmWGhQNVRCdG5SQy1IR1JoeUsxTzFMQk8xemF4cnRnN2ZLSXE1U0RvSlg1cWU4Q1RZb2VqWXd3TmZ6UmZ1WGx5bHlUYkRScA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3invi800203b6n2d2vxtle@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An estimated 14.3 million children globally remain completely unvaccinated, according to a new report, and public health experts point to conflict zones as threatening childhood vaccination efforts worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000a3b6nke2aenyo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Each year, the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund publish a comprehensive report on estimates of national immunization coverage, based on data from 195 countries. This year’s report, released Monday, says there have been some improvements in protecting children against certain diseases through routine vaccinations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000c3b6nut62ppb8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Globally, 171,000 fewer children remained unvaccinated last year than in 2023, according to the report. But that still leaves more than 14 million children vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases and an additional 5.7 million with only partial protection because they may not have gotten all the recommended doses of certain vaccine series.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000d3b6nqgulb1dp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The latest estimates highlight a really concerning trajectory,” Dr. Kate O’Brien, director of WHO’s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals, said in a news briefing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000e3b6n2uzcfsfy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The global vision is for everyone everywhere to benefit from lifesaving vaccines,” she said. “But we’ve hit this very stubborn glass ceiling, and breaking through that glass to protect more children against vaccine-preventable diseases is becoming more difficult.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000f3b6n91yn05y3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rising conflicts and war zones emerging around the world have eroded some of the progress in providing children with immunizations, she added, leading to many children remaining unvaccinated, especially in low- or middle-income countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000g3b6nagwvegl6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Children living in one of 26 countries affected by fragility, conflict or humanitarian emergencies are three times more likely to be unvaccinated compared to children who live in stable countries,” O’Brien said. “In fact, half of all children unvaccinated in the world live in these fragile, vulnerable and conflict countries.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000h3b6nz26p4hqu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new report says that last year, nine countries – Nigeria, India, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Yemen, Afghanistan and Angola – accounted for 52% of all children who have never received a dose of vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000j3b6ntw95iffc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Meanwhile, mostly in high-income countries, vaccine coverage has been affected by vaccine hesitancy and distrust in institutions, leading to a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases including measles and polio, said Dr. Ephrem Lemango, UNICEF’s associate director for health and global chief of immunization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000k3b6niclvxt53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Based on all we know, over the past 50 years, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/24-04-2024-global-immunization-efforts-have-saved-at-least-154-million-lives-over-the-past-50-years" target="_blank"&gt;over 150 million lives were saved through vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, and this has been able to protect children from any forms of vaccine-preventable diseases,” Lemango said at the briefing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000l3b6nze3nadqo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But misinformation and any forms of vaccine hesitance is a reflection of a broader lack of trust or mistrust in the systems that deliver the vaccines, in the health workers that provide the vaccines and in the manufacturing facilities or the ecosystems that manufacture the vaccines,” he said. “So it is important to see misinformation or lack of information as part of a broader ecosystem to be able to address.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000m3b6nkl15urlu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Misinformation appears to be driving outbreaks of disease in pockets of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;countries that tend to have high vaccination rates, O’Brien said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000n3b6nujg1soyh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are communities sort of hidden under that national number that have very low vaccination coverage, and that’s where outbreaks are happening, and those children are the ones who are suffering,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hag3m00003b6ndbds8mcg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the United States, a measles outbreak that originated in a part of West Texas that has a low vaccination rate continues to spread, and there have been more measles cases reported in the US this year than any other since the disease was declared eliminated a quarter-century ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000o3b6nw2oij7ua@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But O’Brien added that while the effects of misinformation remain concerning, they are not the main reason millions of children remain unvaccinated globally.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000p3b6nu4mxj23e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The main reason, when you look worldwide, why children aren’t vaccinated is because of access to vaccines and access to vaccination services – and this is where it’s particularly important,” O’Brien said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000q3b6naqqed164@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re not being vaccinated because they don’t have access,” she said. “They’re in dangerous settings, it’s hard to gain access to them, and in some situations, the government does not have access to those environments.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000s3b6ny6x939sh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new report comes amid growing concern about funding for global vaccination efforts. The Trump administration has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/30/politics/bush-obama-trump-usaid"&gt;dismantled the US Agency for International Development&lt;/a&gt;, or USAID, which has partnered with organizations like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to provide vaccines. And the US has announced plans to reduce funding for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000t3b6nak8u37mf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We still have a lot of work to do,” WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a news release. “Drastic cuts in aid, coupled with misinformation about the safety of vaccines, threaten to unwind decades of progress. WHO remains committed to working with our partners to support countries to develop local solutions and increase domestic investment to reach all children with the lifesaving power of vaccines.”

            The new report says that in 2024, protection against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis remained constant, as an estimated 89% of infants globally received at least one dose of the DTP vaccine, the same share as in 2023 and 2022. Roughly 85% completed all three recommended doses of vaccine last year, compared to 84% in 2023 and 85% in 2022.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000x3b6nzcdkofgs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The percentage of children receiving their first dose of measles vaccine remained relatively constant last year, at 84%, compared to 83% in 2023 and 2022. But that share is lower than in 2019, when coverage was 86%, according to the new report. Overall, the report says, 20.6 million children missed their routine first dose of measles vaccine last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx00103b6nq21fumza@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Meanwhile, the global percentage of children receiving their second dose of measles vaccine increased from 73% in 2022 and 74% in 2023 to 76% in 2024, according to the new report.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000z3b6nrz5bniw7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the United States, childhood vaccine coverage has been declining, and the vast majority of measles cases this year – more than 90% – have been in people who were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx00133b6nxqmvsoct@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The good news is that we have managed to reach more children with life-saving vaccines. But millions of children remain without protection against preventable diseases, and that should worry us all,” UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in the news release. “We must act now with determination to overcome barriers like shrinking health budgets, fragile health systems along with misinformation and access constraints because of conflicts. No child should die from a disease we know how to prevent.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx00143b6nuzdfuchb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            O’Brien said there has been “incredible improvement” in global coverage of the HPV vaccine, which helps protect against the human papillomavirus, which can cause cervical cancer and other related diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3j4tje002k3b6nu2a1cb3i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The percentage of girls receiving a first dose increased to 31% in 2024, from 27% in 2023 and 20% in 2022. The percentage receiving all the doses of vaccine recommended in their country increased to 28% in 2024, from 21% in 2023 and 14% in 2022, according to the new report.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx00173b6nnuud6nba@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HPV vaccine coverage was somewhat stable among boys, with 8% receiving a first dose in 2024 and 2023.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx00193b6nyfwc1jve@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is a real bright spot in the data that, again, year on year now, we’re seeing increases in HPV vaccine coverage,” O’Brien said, adding that recent increases are largely attributable to the introduction of the vaccine in Nigeria, Bangladesh and four other countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx001a3b6nuobcr0m0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, the new report shows that although there hasn’t been a significant retreat in childhood vaccine coverage globally, there hasn’t been significant improvement either, said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, who was not involved in the report.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx001b3b6nx7j94c0d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Fourteen million children who have received no vaccines is 14 million too many. Childhood vaccination is one of the most cost-effective medical interventions that’s ever been developed,” Barouch said. “I would hope that global health authorities prioritize childhood vaccination programs and that funding mechanisms are developed to ensure the continuation of these programs.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feline infectious peritonitis, or FIP, is a serious and historically fatal disease in cats caused by a coronavirus. It behaves in many ways like severe coronavirus infections in humans, causing widespread inflammation, T cell exhaustion, and chronic immune dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;
     
     
     &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7587637799"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
     
&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California, Davis, have found that mesenchymal stromal cells, or MSC therapy, in combination with antiviral drugs, helped &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cats/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cats&lt;/a&gt;' immune systems recover and reduced systemic inflammation. The study was published in &lt;i&gt;Stem Cells Translational Medicine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings support the idea that FIP in cats is a useful model for studying long-term immune problems after a viral infection—something that also happens in some people after illnesses like COVID-19," said corresponding author Amir Kol, associate professor in the Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It shows that MSC therapy might not only reduce short-term inflammation but help bring the immune system back into lasting balance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FIP in cats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feline coronavirus usually infects the cells lining a cat's intestines and causes only mild stomach issues. In some cats, a mix of genetic and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/environmental+factors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;environmental factors&lt;/a&gt; can alter the virus's behavior, allowing it to infect &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt; and spread throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus can develop into either wet FIP, where fluid builds up in the chest or belly, or dry FIP, where fluid doesn't build up but inflammation still affects organs. Both types of FIP cause fever, widespread inflammation, problems in multiple organs and a drop in important immune cells. It's estimated to affect around 2% of cats, most commonly young cats in shelters or catteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, most cases of FIP were fatal. In 2018, UC Davis researchers first reported that an antiviral agent called GS-441524 successfully cured cats with FIP. But the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/patent+holder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;patent holder&lt;/a&gt; at the time never applied for approval to sell it. Only within the last year has a U.S. veterinary compounding pharmacy made the drug available in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Long-term FIP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, few studies have tracked cats long-term after they recover from FIP. But Kol said some of these cats still have enlarged lymph nodes, which happens when part of the immune system stays active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that even after the cats appear to recover, their immune systems may still be working overtime—similar to how some people experience long COVID after recovering from COVID-19. This ongoing immune stimulation may signify a "long-FIP"-like syndrome in cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Even if you treat the infection with antivirals, your immune system, oftentimes, still won't go back to normal or where it was before infection," said Kol. "This might have long-lasting effects on your health and this study shows that MSC may help."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clinical trial with antivirals and MSC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers wanted to see whether cellular therapy could enhance immune recovery in the cats with enlarged lymph nodes. For this clinical trial, one group of cats with FIP received &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/antiviral+drugs/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;antiviral drugs&lt;/a&gt; along with infusions of MSCs, and the other received an antiviral drug and placebo infusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As expected, all cats survived because the antiviral treatment is effective in getting rid of the virus," said Kol. "But we definitely saw evidence of immune recovery in those cats that were treated with MSC compared to the ones that weren't."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that the treated cats had fewer overly active T and B cells (which can cause immune overdrive), and more regulatory T cells (which help calm the immune system). Other tests confirmed that this therapy helped exhausted immune cells recover and possibly form long-term "memory" cells that protect the body in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists found the treatment safe with no serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings not only matter for helping cats with FIP and their owners, but they could also help scientists better understand similar viruses in humans, like COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's important to understand that many pets suffer from diseases that are similar to human diseases," said Kol. "Veterinary medicine is a wonderful platform to conduct translational science that helps both pets and humans."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you’re prone to constipation, it’s best to steer clear of high-fat foods before bed—think cheese, processed snacks or heavy takeout,” says &lt;a href="http://www.samanthadevitonutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Samantha DeVito, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;. “These types of meals can slow digestion and may make things worse overnight when your gut naturally slows down.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even large servings of nut butters before bed can be problematic, according to &lt;a href="https://www.goodgutnutritionist.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kerry Conlon, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian specializing in digestive diseases. “Although they are healthy fats, eating too much nut butter before bed can slow down gastric emptying, which means food moves through your digestive system slowly, which can lead to constipation,” she explains. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your digestive system follows a circadian rhythm, or 24-hour clock, meaning it’s more active during the day and winds down at night.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Eating foods that are high in fat too close to bedtime can delay stomach emptying and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-before-in-the-morning-to-help-you-poop-11718405" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce the natural morning urge&lt;/a&gt; to go. Instead, choose lighter, high-fiber meals in the evening to support regularity and work &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; your body’s natural rhythm—not against it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-alcohol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Alcohol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re used to having a nightcap or a glass of wine before bed, you may want to rethink it if you’re not as regular as you’d like to be. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Alcohol acts as a diuretic by lowering levels of vasopressin—a hormone that helps your kidneys hold on to water. When vasopressin is suppressed, your body loses more fluid through frequent urination, which can lead to mild dehydration.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Dehydration can cause harder, drier stools that are more difficult to pass. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking alcohol can also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-can-disturb-your-sleep-8551851" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;disrupt your sleep&lt;/a&gt;, says &lt;a href="https://www.manhattangastroenterology.com/dr-mikhail-yakubov/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Mikhail Yakubov, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified gastroenterologist at Manhattan Gastroenterology. “Sleep and digestion are closely linked through your body’s circadian rhythm,” says Yakubov. “Poor sleep quality or insufficient rest can slow gut motility, making it harder to have a morning bowel movement.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047875/what-are-refined-carbs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Refined grains&lt;/a&gt; like white bread, white pasta, white rice and desserts may be a comforting nighttime snack, but they can make things worse if you’re feeling backed up. These foods are stripped of most of their fiber during processing, which means they lack the bulk that helps move stool through the digestive tract. “Fiber acts as a broom sweeping through to help keep us regular and remove waste products,” says &lt;a href="http://www.phxvegandietitian.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Rhyan Geiger, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Highly processed foods that are low in fiber may contribute to slower digestion and movement through the system, causing constipation,” Conlon adds. Instead, opt for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-fiber-fruits-to-eat-11747635" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-fiber fruits&lt;/a&gt; like kiwi or dates or high-fiber grains such as oats.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-protein-boosted-snacks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Protein-Boosted Snacks &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein is an essential nutrient that everyone needs, but not all proteins are created equal—especially when it comes to digestion. “Many of the high-protein snacks on the market—such as protein bars, cookies, pretzels and chips—contain protein isolates and sugar substitutes that can contribute to uncomfortable bloating and gas in people with sluggish digestion,” says Conlon&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While these foods are a convenient way to increase your protein intake, they may cause constipation in some people. Conlon recommends &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-protein-blueberry-peanut-butter-chia-pudding-11713745" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chia pudding&lt;/a&gt; as a high-protein, high-fiber snack to enjoy before bed. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-dairy-products"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Dairy Products &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Dairy-based snacks like yogurt, milk and cheese might contribute to constipation if you’re sensitive to lactose or have a tendency toward sluggish digestion,” says DeVito. These foods contain protein and fat that take longer to break down in your digestive system. While slower digestion can help keep you feeling full longer for some people, it can be challenging if you already struggle with regular bowel movements. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you notice that dairy products tend to leave you feeling backed up, especially in the evening, it’s a good idea to limit how much you consume before bed. Choosing &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290640/lactose-intolerance-symptoms-causes-what-to-eat-and-more/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lactose-free alternatives&lt;/a&gt; or plant-based options can be easier on your digestive system and may help support smoother digestion overnight.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-things-to-do-before-bed-to-help-reduce-constipation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Things to Do Before Bed to Help Reduce Constipation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a light snack rich in fiber and fluids. &lt;/strong&gt;DeVito recommends berries with probiotic-rich kefir or a small bowl of oatmeal with chia seeds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a nighttime routine for good sleep. &lt;/strong&gt;“A consistent sleep schedule helps. Your gut thrives on routine just like the rest of your body,” says DeVito. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day to help maintain bowel regularity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice gentle movement. &lt;/strong&gt;Conlon recommends some form of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/evening-activity-to-help-you-poop-in-the-morning-11701702" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;light movement after dinner&lt;/a&gt; to encourage digestion, such as walking. Studies show that higher levels of activity are associated with a lower risk of constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat consistent meals and snacks. &lt;/strong&gt;“The timing of your meals matters when it comes to bowel regularity,” says Conlon. Avoid eating too close to bedtime and aim to spread meals and snacks evenly throughout the day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just as there are things that can relieve constipation, there are some things that could be making it worse, particularly things you consume before bed. Much like your sleep, your digestion operates on a circadian rhythm, with things naturally slowing down at nighttime. Eating foods that slow digestion or drinking alcohol before bed can worsen constipation and leave you feeling even more backed up in the morning. Since everyone responds differently, some trial and error may be needed to find which foods are best to avoid before bed.&lt;br&gt;

people – all middle-aged volunteers – have been asked to complete physical tests, answer regular health and lifestyle questions, and provide DNA and other biological samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Their blood, urine and saliva are frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at temperatures of -80C (-112F) in huge refrigerators in Stockport, Greater Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The imaging part of the project began in 2014, and involves taking detailed scans of 100,000 of those same participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;All of that group will be invited back to repeat the process every few years to see how their bodies and organs change as they grow older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;By combining those scans with the other data collected by UK Biobank, scientists can test whether early changes to the make-up of the brain or body then lead to diseases

class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Two decades later it is now reaching maturity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Over 30 petabytes, or 30,000 terabytes, of anonymised health data is already available to researchers working for universities, charities, governments and the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Scientists in the UK and the rest of the world can apply

class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Louise Thomas, professor of metabolic imaging at the University of Westminster, says it is "completely transforming" how she and other researchers do their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We thought it was a crazy idea, there was absolutely no way anybody could scan this number of people," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"To analyse these images manually would have taken us thousands of years but now... we can extract all the information automatically, so we can measure everything in the

project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Almost 1,700 peer-reviewed papers have been written using all types of Biobank data since work started in 2003, with dozens more now published

for the first time in nearly 20 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pneumonic plague is caused by bacteria carried by species like rats and prairie dogs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pneumonic and bubonic plague transmission and symptoms vary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Pneumonic plague killed a resident of northern Arizona, who died in the emergency room at Flagstaff Medical Center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;No information on age, gender or other demographics was provided by Coconino County Health and Human Services. The &lt;a href="https://www.coconino.az.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=3242" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.coconino.az.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=3242"&gt;notice&lt;/a&gt; said the risk of human-to-human transmission is extraordinarily low, according to the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/12/us/pneumonic-plague-arizona-death.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/12/us/pneumonic-plague-arizona-death.html"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; reported the recent death is the first from this plague in Coconino County in nearly 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Pneumonic plague is a terrible lung infection that, like bubonic plague, is caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium, which is carried by rodents. Rodents like rats and prairie dogs in the West may carry the bacteria, but human infection is quite rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps-statistics/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps-statistics/index.html"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; said plague is endemic in the Southwest and most cases are in northern Arizona, southern Colorado and New Mexico. The other region with significant plague potential is California, southern Oregon and far western Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Plague-infections" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Plague infections&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Pneumonic and bubonic plague are transmitted differently and have different symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Bubonic plague usually comes from a flea bite or being exposed to infected material, which leads to miserable, swollen lymph nodes. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pneumonic-plague-death-arizona-2c32ed6bd4a86be3d38828fe69aeb68b" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://apnews.com/article/pneumonic-plague-death-arizona-2c32ed6bd4a86be3d38828fe69aeb68b"&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; reported that the plague can also spread to humans if they touch infected bodily fluids, so health care experts suggest being particularly careful if you must handle dead or sick animals. Pets can also carry the infection. Cats are especially susceptible to plague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Pneumonic plague is even more serious than bubonic. It happens when the bacteria are inhaled into the lungs. It can also result from untreated bubonic plague. Although it killed millions and millions of people in the 1300s, plague in humans is now treatable, but antibiotics have to be administered early in the infection. The CDC reported that 80% of U.S. plague cases have been bubonic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Per the CDC, “In recent decades, an average of seven human plague cases have been reported each year (range: 0–17 cases per year). Plague has occurred in people of all ages (infants up to age 96), though 50% of cases occur in people ages 12–45. It occurs in both men and women, though historically is slightly more common among men, probably because of increased outdoor activities that put them at higher risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="About-plague-and-how-to-avoid-it" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;About plague and how to avoid it&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Humans infected with the bacteria can develop symptoms in one to eight days after being exposed. Per the Arizona health officials, symptoms “may include fever, chills, headache, weakness and muscle pain. Some individuals may also develop swollen lymph nodes (called ‘buboes’), most commonly in the groin, armpits or limbs. The disease can become septicemic (spreading throughout the bloodstream) and/or pneumonic (affecting the lungs) but is curable with proper antibiotic therapy if diagnosed and treated early.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The inhaled, pneumonic version is deadliest and easiest to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Arizona health agency offered tips to prevent exposure to plague:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid contact with wild animals, including not touching sick or dead animals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To avoid fleas, which can carry plague, use an insect repellent with 20-30% DEET and tuck pant cuffs into your socks to prevent flea bites.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use veterinarian-recommended flea treatments on pets and don’t let them go into areas known to contain wild rodents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report prairie dog “die-offs.” The animals are highly vulnerable to plague and tend to die off quickly after an infection, so they are a warning of plague presence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prevent rodent infestations by removing brush, rock piles, trash and lumber from around homes and buildings. Store food in containers rodents can’t get into.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t camp near rodent burrows and avoid sleeping directly on the ground.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Call the vet if your pet shows symptoms such as high fever or swollen lymph nodes, seems lethargic, has no appetite or develops a cough or eye drainage. Call before taking your pet in, though, to avoid exposing other pets or humans to possible infection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 23:06:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxNQ3ZDZlJ1OXhpS004VGRmeFFncmxPZUFoY1V6MG5KOVVBNXlqWUJXbVBDWGpkOEFCQzBHVGlJbDZwTE9vbWlRenVISV8tQkd1OWFZcTBpdHpraE53cmRUazRpSWhvQm1hcUZRTmRGTUhBUVdfNzVBWkhxWlRRcVZNb1JJLWZJYnlkNDR1aF91YXJQSEo4T2lqNTZqTVdSWWx2RkdiWldTcjRMR2Zja0ZUc25zSGE</guid></item><item><title>失眠可能是降低多动症成人生活满意度的关键，研究发现- Medical Xpress | Insomnia could be key to lower life satisfaction in adults with ADHD traits, study finds - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNS20yTWpIellIWS1YWGpXRU5zaHNDRnM3NUNUaHpJenZjUEY0ZkxkTU1NZ0pkVHFvVmhXNl9oOFNSY1huNlZybkJLQTNIX09mWFJJR1NPRlN5YTFlR2J2WkxtcHNfaENXUm1nclFENUc5ZlgzVmpYWkRLWkFrNUMxQnRJeHFRS0tU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insomnia could explain why adults with ADHD traits report having a lower quality of life, according to new research led by the University of Southampton and the Netherlands Institute of Neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;A study titled "Associations of ADHD symptom severity, sleep/circadian factors, depression, and quality of life," published in &lt;i&gt;BMJ Mental Health&lt;/i&gt;, found that having higher ADHD traits was associated with a lower quality of life and that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/insomnia/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt; could be part of the reason why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least one in four people with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/attention+deficit+hyperactivity+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; (ADHD) report having a sleep disorder, with insomnia being the most common of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings show a link between ADHD traits, insomnia severity, and reduced &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/life+satisfaction/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;life satisfaction&lt;/a&gt;," says Dr. Sarah L. Chellappa, Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Southampton and senior author on the research paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know that sleep disruption can impact neurobehavioral and cognitive systems, including attention and emotional regulation. At the same time, sleep disruption may arise from ADHD-related impulsivity and hyperactivity, suggesting a reinforcing cycle between &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sleep+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sleep disorders&lt;/a&gt; and ADHD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Southampton and the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience (Prof Eus Van Someren) examined data from the Netherlands Sleep Registry, an online survey with more than ten thousand adult participants.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The team analyzed responses from 1,364 participants who had answered questions about ADHD traits, sleep disturbances, circadian factors, depression, and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found ADHD traits were associated with worse depression, more severe insomnia, lower sleep quality, and a preference for going to bed and waking up later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD and insomnia severity both predicted a lower quality of life, with analysis suggesting insomnia was the potential link in this association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Adults with ADHD traits may be more likely to have low sleep quality, insomnia complaints, and low mood levels, all of which lead to reduced life satisfaction," says Professor Samuele Cortese, a co-author on the paper, also from the University of Southampton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There needs to be more research to understand this complex interplay. By improving our understanding, we could uncover treatment options that improve the quality of life of people with ADHD. For instance, targeting insomnia complaints in individuals with higher ADHD traits with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia or Sleep Restriction therapy may help improve their quality of life."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study has revealed promising progress in developing a non-invasive sampling method to detect early signs of Parkinson's disease—up to seven years before motor symptoms appear—by analyzing the chemical makeup of skin.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The research, published today in &lt;i&gt;npj Parkinson's Disease&lt;/i&gt;, demonstrates that compounds or "volatiles" found in sebum—the oily substance produced by our skin—hold key biomarkers for identifying Parkinson's in its earliest stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a technique known as Thermal Desorption-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (TD-GC-MS), scientists at The University of Manchester, in collaboration with Salford Royal NHS Trust and University of Innsbruck, analyzed skin swabs from participants with Parkinson's, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/healthy+volunteers/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;healthy volunteers&lt;/a&gt;, and those with a sleep disorder called isolated REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (iRBD)—a known early warning sign of Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that people with iRBD had distinct chemical profiles in their sebum that were different from healthy individuals, but not yet as pronounced as those with established Parkinson's disease. This supports the idea that Parkinson's disease leaves a detectable trace on the body well before physical symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joy Milne—the "super smeller" who &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-10-nose-parkinson-diagnosis.html"&gt;inspired the research&lt;/a&gt;—was also able to distinguish swabs from people with iRBD from the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/control+group/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;control group&lt;/a&gt; and Parkinson's patients. Intriguingly, she was able to detect both diseases in two of the swabs that came from iRBD individuals, who were later diagnosed with Parkinson's at their next clinical appointment, after sampling.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Professor Perdita Barran, Professor of Mass Spectrometry at The University of Manchester, said, "This is the first study to demonstrate a molecular diagnostic method for Parkinson's disease at the prodromal or early stage. It brings us one step closer to a future where a simple, non-invasive skin swab could help identify people at risk before symptoms arise allowing for earlier intervention and improved outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involved more than 80 participants, including 46 people with Parkinson's, 28 healthy controls, and nine with iRBD. They found 55 significant features in the sebum that varied between the groups. Those with iRBD often showed levels that sat between the healthy controls and the Parkinson's group, reinforcing the possibility of detecting the disease in its early phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Drupad Trivedi, a researcher from The University of Manchester, built a model that examined the markers in a longitudinal sampling study. He collected samples from Parkinson's patients over a three-year period and found patterns that suggest this method can also be used to map the progression of the disease, which could have use in refining treatment options and improving patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebum is also easy to collect using gauze swabs from the face or upper back, making it ideal for non-invasive routine screening and regular monitoring. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-71598-7" target="_blank"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; by the team has also shown it does not need to be stored in the same cold conditions as other biofluids, such as blood, reducing associated costs.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;The research is inspired by the observations of Joy Milne, who detected a unique scent in individuals with Parkinson's disease, prompting researchers at The University of Manchester to explore sebum as a source of diagnostic biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mass+spectrometry/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mass spectrometry&lt;/a&gt;, a technique that measures the weight of molecules, they have found that there are distinctive Parkinson's markers in sebum, which has led them to develop this non-invasive swab test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings have recently been validated in another paper, published today in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Parkinson's Disease&lt;/i&gt;, where trained dogs were able to detect Parkinson's in the patients recruited by Prof Barren and Dr. Trivedi with remarkable accuracy by smelling skin swabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the researchers are continuing to develop and improve the sebum-based testing to eventually use as a practical tool in real-world clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Drupad Trivedi, Lecturer in Analytical Measurement Sciences at The University of Manchester, said, "Our goal is to develop a reliable, non-invasive test that helps doctors detect Parkinson's earlier, track its progression, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're also keen to hear from other hyperosmic individuals, potential 'super smellers' like Joy, whose remarkable sense of smell could help extend our work to detect other diseases with potential odor signatures."&lt;/p&gt;

            When most of us think about sugar, I bet we’re not thinking about our sex lives. We’re thinking about dessert. I’m writing this with the help of a bowl of vanilla ice cream by my side.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3k000o356nvmokxbq7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sugar makes us feel good in the moment, but over time, too much of it may cause us to lose out on some of life’s most intimate moments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3k000p356n2n6me7np@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2025, everyone’s been buzzing about GLP-1 injections to help control sugar and lose weight. This new class of medication has helped many achieve meaningful health gains — including improved blood sugar, weight loss — and even improvements to people’s sex lives (because they could be getting better sleep, too).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3k000q356nhpzffsj2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            My goal here isn’t to discount the use of GLP-1 drugs or suggest people are taking them unnecessarily (although some people may be). My intent is to spark a broader conversation: What if we also paid more attention to the root cause: our love for sugar and its downstream effects on mood, metabolism, sex and more?
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Most people associate blood sugar with diabetes, but few know what is “normal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Blood sugar levels can be checked in real time with a simple finger stick, via home glucose monitor or through wearable devices such as continuous glucose monitors (those coin-size devices you may see on people’s upper arms), which provide feedback on glucose levels throughout the day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            What do we see when this test is done? Following is the American Diabetes Association &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/diagnosis" target="_blank"&gt;range of reference&lt;/a&gt; for blood glucose levels, but they are not meant for you to diagnose yourself with diabetes. In many instances, your provider may double- or even triple-check these numbers before labeling you with “diabetes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l000u356nhudvnhm7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All numbers should be evaluated by your health care provider.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            The point-of-care glucose test gives a snapshot, but there’s one lab that tells the full story — the hemoglobin A1c.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmd3fuy6f001p356nv4x6r7we@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="what-is-hemoglobin-a1c-and-why-does-it-matter" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        What is hemoglobin A1c, and why does it matter?
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l0012356nd39hm2nk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This blood test measures the percentage of hemoglobin proteins in your blood that have glucose attached to it — giving you and your health care providers a picture of your average blood sugar over the past two to three months. This makes it a reliable indicator of how well your body manages glucose over time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l0013356nb0x552wk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s how the &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/diagnosis" target="_blank"&gt;American Diabetes Association&lt;/a&gt; breaks it down:
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/list/instances/cmd3fvv8f001y356nl9ci8ndq@published" class="list-elevate vossi-list" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

      &lt;li data-editable="items.0.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Normal: A1c below 5.7%
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.1.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Prediabetes: 5.7% to 6.4%
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.2.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Diabetes: 6.5% or higher
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l0017356ncqvjtrp0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In my work as a surgeon, checking A1c before any procedure — especially those involving implants — is standard practice. Elevated A1c levels are strongly linked to poor recovery, infection risks and surgical complications. So, whether it’s a major urologic procedure or something else, keeping your glucose in check matters more than most people realize.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l0018356ngpoesmus@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sexual health is rarely the first thing people associate with blood sugar, but chronically high glucose levels can have an impact on intimacy — for everyone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l0019356nzt4d1wzh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In men, high blood sugar can damage the nerves and blood vessels essential for achieving and maintaining erections. Over time, this can present as erectile dysfunction, before a man is ever diagnosed with or thought to be at risk for diabetes. High blood sugar can also &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/08/health/low-testosterone-wellness"&gt;lower testosterone&lt;/a&gt; levels, which then reduce libido and energy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001a356nyevrg4r8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many of my patients who do not get routine screenings from their primary care providers come to see me because of changes in sexual performance — only to later discover their blood sugar is out of control. For these patients, their first clue that something was wrong wasn’t thirst, weight changes or fatigue (the more common early signs of diabetes) — it was trouble in the bedroom.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001b356nmmimv0wq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In women, high blood sugar can lead to reduced blood flow and hormone imbalances, which may cause vaginal dryness, painful sex or problems with orgasm. It can also increase the risk of recurrent urinary tract infections, which can make intimacy painful or less appealing. Many women can feel frustrated and confused about whether these changes are expected from aging, post-menopause, stress or something else. A poor sugar level is usually the last thing on their mind.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001c356nf5bch2gv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Diabetes is incredibly common — &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/php/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;about 38 million Americans have it&lt;/a&gt; — and nearly 1 in 4 don’t even know it, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001d356nqiido2he@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Traditionally, diabetes treatment started with oral medications like metformin, which helps lower glucose by reducing sugar production in the liver. Other classes of pills work in different ways, either by increasing insulin release or helping the kidneys flush out excess sugar. These medications are typically prescribed for people in the earlier stages of diabetes or with mildly elevated A1c.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001e356nvmypf19m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Injectable medications may be necessary when oral pills aren’t enough to treat the disease. For years, that often meant daily insulin injections, which many patients found to be burdensome but necessary. Insulin needs to be carefully timed with meals, and dosing can be tricky. There’s also a real fear of low blood sugar episodes, which can make some people hesitant to start or stick with the therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001f356n73a8xxfz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Over the past few years, GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs have become part of many people’s treatment regimens. This class of medication is known by names like semaglutide, liraglutide and tirzepatide. These injections mimic a natural hormone in your body that helps regulate blood sugar, slows down digestion and make you feel fuller faster.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001g356nalmlvhjm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While they were originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, they’ve gained worldwide attention for helping people lose weight. In fact, many patients now ask and get these medications before any other option — not just to manage blood sugar, but to lose weight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001h356n7cbipkk7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These medications also may help normalize testosterone levels in men with obesity or type 2 diabetes, according to &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1090292" target="_blank"&gt;preliminary research&lt;/a&gt; presented at the Endocrine Society’s annual meeting this week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001i356nn9ip8uhu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers tracked 110 men who were prescribed GLP-1 injections but were not taking any testosterone therapy. Over the course of 18 months, as participants lost on average about 10% of their body weight, the number of men with normal testosterone levels increased from 53% to 77%. This rise highlights how medications originally designed for diabetes and weight loss also may improve hormone levels in men.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            While this abstract has not yet been peer-reviewed and more research is needed, these findings add to a growing body of evidence that managing weight and blood sugar can have ripple effects across nearly every aspect of health — including testosterone, energy and sexual function.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Before turning immediately to medications, don’t underestimate what consistent lifestyle changes can do, not just for your blood sugar but for your whole life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Regular exercise improves insulin sensitivity, supports weight loss, boosts energy and even enhances sexual function by improving blood flow and hormone balance. A balanced diet — one that’s rich in whole foods, fiber and lean protein — can stabilize blood sugar and reduce inflammation that contributes to chronic disease. Better sleep, reduced alcohol and managing stress all play a role, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            So, if you’re debating between an injection or a new routine, maybe this time reach for the gym bag before you try anything else. You might just find it changes more than your labs. It might change how you feel about yourself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            As for me, the next time I help myself to that scoop of ice cream while writing, I’ll remember that it’s not just about my waistline — it’s about my energy, my heart and my sexual health. And now that I’m done with this article, I’ll pick up my gym bag and walk the walk (to the gym) that I’m talking here.
    &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p class="bodytext"&gt;A team of researchers just discovered compounds that could lead to a new generation of antiviral drugs capable of fighting many viruses at once. Instead of targeting a specific virus, the new molecules work by activating a powerful defense pathway within the host's own cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="bodytext"&gt;The technology focuses on a natural cellular defense system called the integrated stress response pathway. Cells normally trigger this pathway to shut down protein production when they detect a viral infection, which stops the virus from replicating. The newly identified compounds act as amplifiers for this response. “If the pathway were turned on in response to viral infection, what our compounds do is they turn it on full blast,” explains Felix Wong, the lead author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="bodytext"&gt;To find these molecules, the team developed a novel screening technique to test nearly 400,000 different chemical compounds. This process yielded several promising candidates. In tests on human cells, these compounds successfully helped the cells fend off infections from RSV, herpes virus, and Zika virus. One of the compounds, IBX-200, also proved effective in mice, where it reduced the viral load and suppress symptoms of a herpes infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="bodytext"&gt;One interesting thing about this approach is that the compounds appear to have no effect on cells that are not already infected, only activating when a virus triggers the stress response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="bodytext"&gt;We are very excited about this work, which allows us to harness the stress response of the host cells to arrive at a means to identify and develop broad-spectrum antivirals. — &lt;strong&gt;James Collins&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the authors on the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="bodytext"&gt;The team now plans to test the compounds against more viruses in hopes of eventually developing them for clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person" rel="author" class="nbc_rightbox journalist_bottom"&gt;&lt;div class="j_author"&gt;&lt;a href="Notebookcheck-Team.212978.0.html?&amp;amp;tx_nbc2journalist_pi1%5Bmode%5D=show&amp;amp;tx_nbc2journalist_pi1%5Buid%5D=369" class="j_name"&gt;Chibuike Okpara&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Tech Writer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span title="53 "&gt; - 53 articles published on Notebookcheck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; since 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="j_abstract"&gt;I have always been fascinated by technology and digital devices my entire life and even got addicted to it. I have always marveled at the intricacy of even the simplest digital devices and systems around us. I have been writing and publishing articles online for about 6 years now, just about a year ago, I found myself lost in the marvel of smartphones and laptops we have in our hands every day. I developed a passion for learning about new devices and technologies that come with them and at some point, I asked myself, "Why not get into writing tech articles?" It is useless to say I followed up the idea — it is evident. I am an open-minded individual who derives an infinite amount of joy from researching and discovering new information, I believe there is so much to learn and such a short life to live, so I put my time to good use — learning new things. I am a 'bookworm' of the internet and digital devices. When I am not writing, you will find me on my devices still, I do explore and admire the beauty of nature and creatures. I am a fast learner and quickly adapt to changes, always looking forward to new adventures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Notebookcheck</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 22:37:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi3AFBVV95cUxQNUx2V0F6UUtWZlVfRE05OVh5RTB2YUNIRnhiTFY4Mk5Rb2JJM0pCZFNCVzNWc1hSZzFvaWFzQzBNdkE2VktUaDE4V0FJbUstZC02T0QzZXJhQ3ZpVGw0VVdhY2lDbUVJYXQ4Rk9pYUhZSVpucTZ5TXZ6Vml4YlFweElFWEJ6Ql9hTjJJVTFKVW9CTXB1NGl6QjUteGtZd3R3bm5mSGY4OFVEVExEXzJ3NkVSS2dKa2tPM3VUWkYyaTdMcFRzRkN1SXBKZUVRakhxUlFJdHR1WTlRcGJv</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员确认爱荷华州东部的麻疹，列出暴露地点- KWWL | Health officials confirm measles in eastern Iowa, list exposure locations - KWWL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi8gFBVV95cUxNenFkU0ZBNzRzbTZuR1EyWnV4UGdwbGY2SHMxLXpuV0YzaVNBSTlyeDV3RG5SX2Y4YTNLVnlfcTg5RVUtM1BkN2ZxQTZ2Ukk4bTVpUXY2LXExb2hmd29zaGFJUU1kaGhhbE4yalZkNDY5T3k2WThuTEswck9TWmVLX2RMcmQtN2FIXzlFbTIxZ29NVlFpQXR2VS1GUS1hS2F0NDI3VE41SzAzS241dHNFRWV3RTA3QVdpeTJCTUo0UjAwR1U0RnQzX2VLVENVWjJMQ0h2amhKLUM0X2VFR2JXalBwaEIzOEI0TVpBMm9rbDFwZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;

She suspected something more serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite being in excellent health, on a &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/veganism/index.html" id="mol-01356660-60fb-11f0-bfd1-65124ca6fb5b"&gt;vegan&lt;/a&gt; diet, with no family history of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-01328030-60fb-11f0-bfd1-65124ca6fb5b"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and normal bloodwork, she struggled to get answers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Multiple specialists, allergists, internists, and gastroenterologists, found nothing unusual. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She set an appointment for a colonoscopy in early 2015, something her doctor had recommended. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There, it appeared that what she had believed was a hemorrhoid for years looked more like polyps, abnormal growths of tissue that can turn cancerous. To be safe, she was referred to a colorectal surgeon for an MRI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was with her chiropractor, who helped her with her low abdominal pain, when she got the call. What the GI doctor initially believed was a benign polyp developed into malignant tumor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tracy Robert, a personal trainer and nutrition coach, was diagnosed with colon cancer at 40. She had been told for over 20 years that what doctors said were IBS symptoms were actually early signs of cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, about 10 percent of colon cancer cases are &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6306175/Bowel-cancer-rates-rise-younger-people-Europe.html"&gt;diagnosed in people under 50.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those numbers are rising about one to two percent each year, and researchers are still finding out why. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Robert was diagnosed with stage 2B to 3A colorectal cancer, indicating that the cancer had spread beyond the outermost layer of the colon into the rectum wall, she told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.self.com/story/tracy-robert-colorectal-cancer-hemorrhoids"&gt;Self&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors were set to surgically remove the mass, but first, she would have to take oral chemotherapy pills every day along with radiation treatments five days a week for three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The tumor was buried deep in her rectum, tangled around the sphincter muscles that control bowel movements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surgeons had no choice but to divert her colon, bypassing her anus entirely, and bring it through her abdominal wall instead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, waste empties into a colostomy bag, a permanent fixture on her stomach. Adjusting to that was one of the most challenging parts of her cancer battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I felt like I lost my sexiness, like I lost my innocence,' she told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-colon-cancer-misdiagnosed-ibs-hemorrhoid-2025-3"&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;. 'That put me down a really dark hole.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Robert was diagnosed with stage 2B to 3A colorectal cancer, indicating that the cancer had spread beyond the outermost layer of the colon into the rectum wall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As a personal trainer who also did nutrition coaching, she worried about being judged for her colostomy bag: 'I felt a lot of shame around it and a lot of 'what did I do wrong?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a personal trainer who also did nutrition coaching, she worried about being judged for her colostomy bag: 'I felt a lot of shame around it and a lot of 'what did I do wrong?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A self-described 'eternal optimist,' Robert found herself unable to play the role of 'ray of sunshine' for her family. The toll was most evident in her sons, then just seven and nine, who left their own beds at night and clung to her instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was rediagnosed with stage 0 colorectal cancer after the surgery, meaning the cancer hadn't spread beyond the colon lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Post-surgery, Robert underwent several rounds of IV chemotherapy to eliminate any lingering cancer cells. But the treatment took a harsh toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her white blood cell counts repeatedly plummeted to dangerous lows, a common but risky side effect of chemo. Doctors advised cutting the regimen short, to great success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Follow-up scans showed no evidence of disease. Against the odds, she was cancer-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though she is cancer-free, Robert can't help but wonder if she would have a colostomy bag today had a GI specialist signed her up for a colonoscopy despite her being younger than the recommended age to start getting the annual exam, 45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If I could go back to my younger self, I would have asked for a colonoscopy. That could have changed everything,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Doctors would have been able to catch and remove the polyp early so it never would have grown into cancer, and I wouldn't have wound up using a colostomy bag to poop for the rest of my life.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Robert has since taken her story to TikTok in the hope of raising awareness about colorectal cancer in young people as young as 17.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This phenomenon has puzzled and alarmed scientists and doctors who point to a confluence of factors, including poor diet, obesity, processed diets, sedentary lifestyles, antibiotic overuse, and even environmental toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even if you live a healthy lifestyle, whatever that looks like to you: If you feel like something's wrong, or you're not getting clear answers about what's causing your symptoms, keep pushing for answers,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Just because a doctor thinks you have one thing, like a hemorrhoid, it doesn't necessarily mean that's the case—they're only human, and diagnostic tests don't always show the full picture. Research, ask questions, and meet with different doctors. You are your own best advocate.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

She had been told for over 20 years that what doctors said were IBS symptoms were actually early signs of cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, about 10 percent of colon cancer cases are &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6306175/Bowel-cancer-rates-rise-younger-people-Europe.html"&gt;diagnosed in people under 50.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those numbers are rising about one to two percent each year, and researchers are still finding out why. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Robert was diagnosed with stage 2B to 3A colorectal cancer, indicating that the cancer had spread beyond the outermost layer of the colon into the rectum wall, she told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.self.com/story/tracy-robert-colorectal-cancer-hemorrhoids"&gt;Self&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors were set to surgically remove the mass, but first, she would have to take oral chemotherapy pills every day along with radiation treatments five days a week for three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The tumor was buried deep in her rectum, tangled around the sphincter muscles that control bowel movements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surgeons had no choice but to divert her colon, bypassing her anus entirely, and bring it through her abdominal wall instead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, waste empties into a colostomy bag, a permanent fixture on her stomach. Adjusting to that was one of the most challenging parts of her cancer battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I felt like I lost my sexiness, like I lost my innocence,' she told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-colon-cancer-misdiagnosed-ibs-hemorrhoid-2025-3"&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;. 'That put me down a really dark hole.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Robert was diagnosed with stage 2B to 3A colorectal cancer, indicating that the cancer had spread beyond the outermost layer of the colon into the rectum wall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As a personal trainer who also did nutrition coaching, she worried about being judged for her colostomy bag: 'I felt a lot of shame around it and a lot of 'what did I do wrong?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a personal trainer who also did nutrition coaching, she worried about being judged for her colostomy bag: 'I felt a lot of shame around it and a lot of 'what did I do wrong?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A self-described 'eternal optimist,' Robert found herself unable to play the role of 'ray of sunshine' for her family. The toll was most evident in her sons, then just seven and nine, who left their own beds at night and clung to her instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was rediagnosed with stage 0 colorectal cancer after the surgery, meaning the cancer hadn't spread beyond the colon lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Post-surgery, Robert underwent several rounds of IV chemotherapy to eliminate any lingering cancer cells. But the treatment took a harsh toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her white blood cell counts repeatedly plummeted to dangerous lows, a common but risky side effect of chemo. Doctors advised cutting the regimen short, to great success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Follow-up scans showed no evidence of disease. Against the odds, she was cancer-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though she is cancer-free, Robert can't help but wonder if she would have a colostomy bag today had a GI specialist signed her up for a colonoscopy despite her being younger than the recommended age to start getting the annual exam, 45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If I could go back to my younger self, I would have asked for a colonoscopy. That could have changed everything,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Doctors would have been able to catch and remove the polyp early so it never would have grown into cancer, and I wouldn't have wound up using a colostomy bag to poop for the rest of my life.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Robert has since taken her story to TikTok in the hope of raising awareness about colorectal cancer in young people as young as 17.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This phenomenon has puzzled and alarmed scientists and doctors who point to a confluence of factors, including poor diet, obesity, processed diets, sedentary lifestyles, antibiotic overuse, and even environmental toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even if you live a healthy lifestyle, whatever that looks like to you: If you feel like something's wrong, or you're not getting clear answers about what's causing your symptoms, keep pushing for answers,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Just because a doctor thinks you have one thing, like a hemorrhoid, it doesn't necessarily mean that's the case—they're only human, and diagnostic tests don't always show the full picture. Research, ask questions, and meet with different doctors. You are your own best advocate.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brown rice packs more fiber and nutrients than white rice, supporting gut health, stable energy, and overall wellness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;White rice digests faster and spikes blood sugar more, but can still fit into a healthy diet when paired with fiber- or protein-rich foods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Though it has a slightly different taste and texture, brown rice can be an easy, nutritious swap for white rice in many dishes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Rice has been a culinary staple for thousands of years across cultures all over the world, especially in countries like China, India, Japan, and South Korea. But this grain’s popularity has since gone global with this grain taking up permanent residence in many pantries across America.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Historically, white rice has been the traditional choice, however, brown rice has become a go-to choice as well, with particular thanks to its reputation for having more health benefits than white rice. But what are the nutritional advantages of brown rice compared to white rice? How do white and brown rice differ from one another, and how do those differences impact our health (if at all)? Is it really “healthier” to swap white rice for brown rice when ordering takeout or deciding what to make for dinner? It’s time to unpack all your burning &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/is-rice-healthy" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rice nutrition questions&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-nutritional-comparison-between-white-and-brown-rice"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Nutritional Comparison Between White and Brown Rice &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; How do these rice relatives differ on a physical and nutritional basis? “Physically, white rice contains just one part of the usual rice grain anatomy due to a refining process that removes two key parts of whole rice grain,” explains clinical dietitian Caitlin Carr, MS, RD. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whole grains, including whole rice grains (aka brown rice), consist of three structures, or layers—the bran, germ, and endosperm. White rice is made by stripping the bran and germ from brown rice leaving behind its starchy core, the endosperm.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Brown rice provides a bit more fiber than white rice.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This yields some important nutritional differences between the two rice varieties. In two-thirds of a cup, brown rice contains about two grams of fiber whereas white rice contains only about 0.5 grams.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Brown rice contains more vitamins and minerals than white rice.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, “brown rice has more essential minerals like manganese, phosphorus, selenium, and magnesium, along with B-vitamins such as niacin and folate when compared, per cup, to white rice,” Carr says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Brown rice offers more plant compounds than white rice.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Brown rice is also a good source of plant compounds like &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/flavonoids-benefits-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;flavonoids&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These additional phytonutrients found in brown rice help to support better gut, bone, heart, immune, and metabolic health.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Brown rice is digested more slowly and produces lower blood-sugar spikes. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Because of its fiber content, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/high-fiber-carbohydrates-7566945" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;brown rice is a complex carbohydrate&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/what-are-refined-carbs" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;white rice is a simple carbohydrate&lt;/a&gt;. This means that brown rice takes a little longer to digest than white rice,” Carr explains. The increased digestion time of brown rice provides more stable energy levels and also has a positive impact on blood sugars through a more gradual rise and decline in sugar levels. This benefit is particularly significant for those with metabolic concerns like type 2 diabetes, as it can make blood sugar management easier.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; The soluble fiber in brown rice supports a healthy gut and digestion. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Brown rice also contains &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/soluble-fiber-vs-insoluble-fiber" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which is beneficial for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-to-help-you-poop-11769125" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;maintaining bowel regularity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-cholesterol-foods-7567696" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;lowering cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-foods-for-gut-health-7098940" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;feeding our gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;,” Carr says. “When the microorganisms in the gut microbiome metabolize soluble fiber, they produce short-chain fatty acids that are absorbed by the gut lining, beginning a cascade of events that are suggested to lower inflammation and oxidative stress throughout the body.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This benefit is part of the reason why a thriving gut microbiome is linked to better immune, gut, and brain health, among other impressive benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As we’ve already started to see, white rice doesn’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; measure up nutritionally to brown rice due it’s lower fiber and micronutrient content. White rice’s lower fiber content also equates to a higher score on the glycemic index, a scale to measure how quickly a given food will elevate blood sugars. This index ranks foods on a scale of zero to 100, where the higher the score, the more rapidly a food gets digested in the body, and the more quickly our blood sugars spike.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a refined, or simple, carbohydrate, white rice has a &lt;a href="https://glycemic-index.net/white-rice-standard/#:~:text=The%20glycemic%20index%20%28GI%29%20of,as%20a%20high%20GL%20food." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;glycemic index of 70&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href="https://glycemic-index.net/brown-rice/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;brown rice measures in at 50&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, very frequent white rice consumption may put us at increased risk for type 2 diabetes, per a 2019 review.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is not to say, however, that white rice can’t be part of a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-start-eating-healthier-8425807" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;balanced, healthy diet&lt;/a&gt;—especially when it’s eaten accompanied by healthy, high-fiber and high-protein sources. “Brown and white rice are both naturally gluten-free and low-FODMAP foods,” Carr notes, “For individuals with celiac and/or trialing a temporary elimination diet for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), rice [of either variety] may be a good carbohydrate option to include in their meal plans.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The eating experience between these two grains is similar, and they’re typically easy to substitute for one another—however, there are some notable differences. White rice tends to offer a softer texture and more neutral, mild taste. Brown rice, on the other hand, has a chewier texture and nuttier flavor. These differences can take some getting used to if white rice has always been your go-to, but that doesn’t preclude brown rice from being an equally delicious swap-out for white rice in most recipes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; White rice is a delicious, traditional, and nostalgic comfort food for many of us, but when you dig into the nutritional details, there’s no denying that brown rice has a leg up in terms of beneficial fiber, micronutrients, and plant compounds. And while white rice enjoyed in moderation can still fit into a healthy, balanced lifestyle, substituting it for brown rice every so often can definitely provide in some wholesome benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The human brain tends to lose a step as we age. Now, scientists want to minimize that decline by studying people with exceptional brains.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once we get past about age 40, even a healthy brain begins to lose a step or two. Reaction times get slower. It's harder to remember everything on your shopping list. But scientists are looking for ways to minimize these changes. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: Memory lapses and slower thinking can be signs of a disease like Alzheimer's. But Matt Huentelman of the Translational Genomics Research Institute in Phoenix says usually they just mean someone's brain is getting older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MATT HUENTELMAN: Both of those things, memory and processing speed, change with age in a normal group of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Huentelman should know. He helps run MindCrowd, a free online cognitive test that's been taken by more than 700,000 people of all ages. Huentelman says about a thousand of those people had test scores indicating their brain was exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HUENTELMAN: The way that we define an exceptional brain is someone who performs at a level that is about 30 years younger than them when it comes to a memory test or a processing speed test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Huentelman says good genes are one factor, but he and a team of researchers are looking for other differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HUENTELMAN: We want to study these exceptional performers because we think they can tell us what the rest of us should be doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Early results suggest that sleep and maintaining cardiovascular health are a good start. Huentelman was one of several dozen researchers who met in Miami this summer to discuss healthy brain aging. The event was hosted by the McKnight Brain Research Foundation. Another speaker was Dr. Christian Agudelo, a sleep neurologist at the University of Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHRISTIAN AGUDELO: I think the value of sleep and sleep deprivation became true to me when I had kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Agudelo's kids are 4 and 6 now. He says his own experience is consistent with his research on the relationship between sleep and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AGUDELO: The better you sleep, the better your brain health is going to be, both structurally and functionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Agudelo says the key is getting high-quality sleep, which allows the brain to cycle through all the sleep stages. Researchers can measure how well a person is sleeping by monitoring their brainwave patterns, but Agudelo says people usually know when they've had a good night's rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AGUDELO: You go to sleep, you wake up and you feel like that experience was worthwhile. You feel refreshed. And we all, hopefully, have experienced that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Ensuring high-quality sleep is tricky, but Agudelo says you can improve the odds with certain behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AGUDELO: Waking up at the same time every single day and aligning our sleep rhythms with the rhythm of the sun. Being active both socially and physically so we can fall asleep more easily and more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Dr. Charles DeCarli, a neurologist at the University of California, Davis, says brain aging is also affected by vascular risk factors like blood pressure, cholesterol levels and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHARLES DECARLI: We tend to think about them as affecting the heart, sometimes the blood vessels in the legs or stroke, not so much as it impacts on the brain itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: But DeCarli's research on thousands of people 65 and older found a strong correlation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DECARLI: The size of the brain, the shape of the brain, the tissue integrity of the brain looks older in people who have these risk factors than those who do not have them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: So DeCarli and a team of researchers are studying whether it's possible to protect the brain by aggressively treating conditions that affect the circulatory system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DECARLI: The question is, if you have these diseases and they're well controlled, will you have a younger-looking brain? And the answer seems to be yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Researchers say other ways to keep your brain youthful include avoiding smoking, limiting alcohol and getting lots of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jon Hamilton, NPR News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new large study from Denmark&lt;/a&gt; directly counters those claims. After mining the vaccination and medical records of more than 1.2 million children over a 24-year period, researchers could see no evidence that exposure to aluminum in vaccines led to a statistically significant increase in a child’s risk of developing any of a wide variety of conditions that can be diagnosed in childhood, including asthma and autism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;None of the 50 conditions the group looked at — broadly categorized as relating to autoimmune diseases, allergy, and neurodevelopmental disorders — occurred at statistically higher levels than would be expected, ruling out moderate or substantially increased risk from exposure to aluminum in vaccines, a finding senior author Anders Hviid described as “quite striking.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We can exclude meaningful increases with a large degree of certainty for many of these outcomes,” Hviid, who heads the department of epidemiology research at the Statens Serum Institut, Denmark’s public health agency, told STAT in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We should not be concerned about aluminum used as an adjuvant in childhood vaccines. I think that’s the core message.” &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Hviid and his co-authors said that while there wasn’t a statistically significant increase seen for any of the conditions they studied, they could not rule out the possibility of a small increased risk for some very rare conditions. “So that tells us that clearly that there’s not an epidemic of chronic diseases in childhood’’ associated with aluminum in vaccines, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The article was published Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other experts agreed with Hviid’s take on the findings. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was very encouraged by the data, particularly for asthma as I know vaccine hesitancy groups are concerned by this,” said Anna Durbin, director of the Center for Immunization Research at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Matthew Daley and Jason Glanz, two authors of an earlier &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/09/27/possible-link-aluminum-childhood-vaccines-asthma-risk-caveats/"&gt;U.S.-based study&lt;/a&gt; that suggested aluminum in childhood vaccines might be tied to an increased risk of developing asthma before age 5, also welcomed the publication. Daley and Glanz, both of whom work at Kaiser Permanente Colorado’s Institute for Health Research, both described the study as well done.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the issue of asthma risk in particular, Daley said this new study should provide reassurance to parents that vaccinating their children according to the recommended schedule should not increase their risk of developing asthma. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As a practicing pediatrician, I find that reassuring, and my patients and other clinicians I work with should find that reassuring,” said Daley, who noted that even after publishing his study about the possible association between aluminum in vaccines and asthma, he continued to urge parents to vaccinate their children, because he felt the benefits of vaccination were greater than the small possible risk his work identified.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aluminum salts are added to some pediatric vaccines to improve the immune response they stimulate. They are used in inactivated vaccines — vaccines made from killed viruses or bacteria — and protein-based vaccines. Vaccines that use live but weakened viruses, such as the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, do not contain aluminum, nor do &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/21/mrna-vaccines-safety-efficacy-senate-committee-probe-myocarditis-adverse-events-covid-shots/"&gt;vaccines made using messenger RNA&lt;/a&gt;, like several of the Covid-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aluminum salts have been used for more than 70 years, and there is a large body of evidence supporting their safety and effectiveness. But they have attracted the attention of opponents of vaccines, who argue they may overstimulate immune systems. The amount of aluminum that children are exposed to through vaccines is well below accepted safe limits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daley and his co-authors undertook their study after a 2013 report on vaccine safety from the Institute of Medicine — which has since been renamed the National Academy of Medicine — urged additional research of whether there might be a link between exposure to aluminum in vaccines and the development of asthma. After their &lt;a href="https://els-jbs-prod-cdn.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/pb/assets/raw/Health%20Advance/journals/acap/Aluminium_Exposure_Article-1664288052690.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;results were published in the journal Academic Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; in 2023, Hviid and his colleagues in Denmark were inspired to take another look. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I feel a sense of gratitude that they undertook this study,” Daley said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigating the safety of aluminum in vaccines is challenging because aluminum is ubiquitous — it’s the third-most abundant element on the planet, Glanz said. Humans encounter it daily, in food, for instance. It is even found in breast milk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hviid and colleagues from the Statens Serum Institut and from the University of Copenhagen used Denmark’s nationwide health care registries to compile a cohort of 1.2 million children born between 1997 and 2018, checking for diagnoses for 50 conditions. They examined the records of the children out to 5 years of age.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because the number of vaccines given in early childhood changed over the 24-year study period, the researchers were able to determine whether rates of any of these conditions changed as the amount of aluminum children received via vaccinations increased when new vaccines were added to the schedule. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That they didn’t see differences among children who received more vaccines in early childhood is a strength of the study, Daley said. That’s because if something causes a biological effect, receiving more of the substance should exacerbate the effect. It’s a phenomenon referred to as a dose response.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“They don’t see any dose response there at all. And their study was set up to see a dose response if one was there,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daley noted a few caveats in interpreting the results, pointing out that the vaccine schedule in Denmark is slightly different from the one used in the United States.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They immunize at 3 months, 5 months, 12 months. We immunize at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 12 months. I would be surprised that that slight difference between 2 and 3 months would make a big difference. But it is important to acknowledge that there is a difference we should keep in mind,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Likewise, this isn’t a randomized controlled trial; researchers were not comparing children who received no aluminum-containing vaccines to children who did get shots containing aluminum. Such a study would not be ethical to conduct because withholding vaccines from some children would put them at risk of serious illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the size of this study and the clear-cut nature of the results underscores the safety of these critical vaccines, Hviid said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines are really important for our immunization programs. Not just in Denmark, not just in the U.S., but globally,” he said. “We don’t have any replacements for these vaccines with other adjuvants. So if you take them away, children are going to die.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Scientists identified a subset of neurons in the prefrontal cortex that integrate oxytocin, ovarian hormones, and social cues to modulate sexual receptivity in females and suppress mating interest in males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activating these neurons made non-fertile females receptive, while silencing them during estrus stopped their interest, with opposite effects in males. The findings show how identical brain circuits can produce dramatically different behaviors in males and females depending on hormonal states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hormone-Responsive Circuit:&lt;/strong&gt; Cacna1h+ neurons in the prefrontal cortex control sociosexual behaviors by integrating oxytocin and ovarian hormone signals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex-Specific Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Activating the circuit boosts mating interest in females but suppresses it in males.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Feedback:&lt;/strong&gt; The neurons both drive and are activated by mating-related social interactions, showing a feedback loop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Rockefeller University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In animals with social structures, the drive to reproduce is a complex process; governed by the brain, it’s influenced by both internal cues such as hormones and external factors such as interactions with potential mates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One area long known to play a critical role is the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Located just behind the forehead, this node governs various aspects of social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent paper in &lt;em&gt;Cell, &lt;/em&gt;researchers at Rockefeller University’s Laboratory of Molecular Biology, led by Nathaniel Heintz, have determined how a subregion of the PFC influences the reproductive drive in mice: through a hormonally primed cortical circuit that controls how and when female mice seek to mate with males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circuit, which connects to multiple layers of the brain, is stimulated by both the “love hormone” oxytocin and ovarian hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The circuit integrates hormonal states with the recognition of potential mates to orchestrate complex cognitive behaviors,” says Ines Ibañez-Tallon, research associate professor in the lab and co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, male mice also have this circuit, but its activation has the opposite effect in them: they become less interested in mating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This shared circuitry is flexibly sculpted by both hormonal state and biological sex to produce sex-specific patterns of social behavior,” says senior co-author Kun Li, a former Ph.D. student in the lab and now an associate professor in the School of Life Sciences at Tsinghua University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It could help explain why sexual motivation and social interest fluctuate across reproductive states and differ between sexes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexual dimorphism in the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper builds upon earlier findings from the lab. In 2014, the researchers discovered a new type of brain cell in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that they dubbed oxytocin receptor-expressing neurons (OxtrINs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin is a hormone linked to bonding of all kinds—maternal, familial, romantic, social. In mice, the team found, the OxtrINs cortical circuit promoted receptivity to mating—but only in females, and only during estrus, or the fertile period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intrigued by the idea that a cell type identical in male and female mice could affect them very differently, the researchers, led by Heintz and Ibañez-Tallon, conducted additional studies that further documented OxtrIN’s uneven influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2016 study, they found that the activation of OxtrINs reduce anxiety-related behavior in male mice but not in female mice. While it did not alter anxiety levels in female mice, it did, however, cause the females to show more social preference for male mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both discoveries pointed to a critical role for the mPFC in adaptive social behaviors dependent on reproductive states, “how the mPFC senses internal hormonal states and regulates flexible control over social behavioral outputs remained unclear,” Li says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the current study, some of which was conducted at Tsinghua University, the researchers aimed to dive into those details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The circuit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previous research had located oxytocin-sensitive neurons in multiple layers of the mPFC. For the current study, Li and colleagues homed in on layer 5, which sends information to other areas of the brain. They identified neurons in this layer that expressed the &lt;em&gt;Cacna1h&lt;/em&gt; gene, which produces calcium channels—electrical switches that neurons use to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then traced its connections into the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHN) region of the hypothalamus, an ancient, hormonally driven part of the brain that regulates basic needs such as hunger, thirst, and sleep, as well as sexual behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then used a variety of advanced techniques to monitor neural activity in the female mice’s brains as they went through a full estrus cycle—the equivalent of a human menstrual cycle—and interacted with male mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cacna1h+ neurons turned out to be highly responsive to ovarian hormones, lighting up when the mice were fertile. During this period, the female mice sought out the male mice more, rejected them less, and showed heightened sexual receptivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting it all together, the team determined that Cacna1h+ neurons are a hormonally influenced critical subset of neurons that respond to prompts from oxytocin via OxtrINs, receiving social cues, and the AHN, which reads internal signals, resulting in sociosexual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, manipulating the neurons changed that behavior in diametrically opposed ways in the mice. When Li turned on the &lt;em&gt;Cacna1h&lt;/em&gt; neurons in female mice during the nonfertile period, the mice began to act as if they were hormonally prepped to mate. And when she inhibited the neurons during estrus, the mice lost all interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opposite was true for the male mice, whose brain activity was also monitored. Silencing the Cacna1h+ neurons in male mice spiked their interest in female mice, and they were quicker to try to mate with them. And activating the neurons suppressed male sexual behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circuit seems to have a feedback loop as well. That is, not only can Cacna1h+ neural activity initiate behavior, but behavior can activate the neurons themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In estrus females, these neurons were strongly activated by male cues and promoted sociosexual interest and sexual receptivity, while in males these neurons did not respond to female cues, and the male mice showed reduced interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s fascinating,” Ibañez-Tallon says. “Even when the neural circuitry, neuronal populations, and molecular components are identical—differing only in their levels of expression—the system can produce remarkably distinct functional outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study focused on ovarian hormones, in the future they’ll look into the influence of testosterone, which has well-established links to depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, and other disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the strikingly different functional roles of Cacna1h+ neurons in males, it’s likely that testosterone plays a key role in their development or responsiveness,” Li says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This line of research could provide valuable insights into the sex-specific regulation and vulnerability of social and emotional behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6c070a0902162c1e030f07090a090000091e42090819" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Katherine Fenz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://rockefeller.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rockefeller University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Katherine Fenz – Rockefeller University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.04.035" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Integrating Reproductive States and Social Cues in the Control of Sociosexual Behaviors&lt;/a&gt;” by Nathaniel Heintz et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrating Reproductive States and Social Cues in the Control of Sociosexual Behaviors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Female sociosexual behaviors, essential for survival and reproduction, are modulated by ovarian hormones and triggered in the context of appropriate social cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we identify primary estrous-sensitive Cacna1h-expressing medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC&lt;sup&gt;Cacna1h+&lt;/sup&gt;) neurons that integrate hormonal states with recognition of potential mates to orchestrate these complex cognitive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bidirectional manipulation of mPFC&lt;sup&gt;Cacna1h+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons shifts opposite-sex-directed social behaviors between estrus and diestrus females via anterior hypothalamic outputs.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research determined that omega-3 fatty acids help decrease blood sugar and insulin resistance.

Median age at the end of the 2-year follow-up period was 5 years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only 15,237 children (1.2%) received no aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines before age 2. Each aluminum-adjuvanted vaccine dose contained&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;0.125 to 1.00 milligram (mg) of aluminum. The total vaccine-related aluminum exposure by age 2 varied by birth year (median, 3 mg). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During follow-up, the team looked for vaccine-related events involving 50 chronic conditions, including 36 autoimmune (dermatologic, endocrinologic, hematologic, gastrointestinal, and rheumatic), 9 atopic or allergic (asthma, atopic dermatitis, rhino conjunctivitis, and allergy), and 5 neurodevelopmental (autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Very low risk of any condition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers found no association between cumulative aluminum exposure in vaccines in the first 2 years of life and increased risk of any of the 50 chronic conditions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This nationwide cohort study did not find evidence supporting an increased risk for autoimmune, atopic or allergic, or neurodevelopmental disorders associated with early childhood exposure to aluminum-adsorbed vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For groups of combined outcomes, adjusted hazard ratios per 1-milligram increase in aluminum exposure were 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94 to 1.02) for any autoimmune disorder, 0.99 (95% CI, 0.98 to 1.01) for any atopic or allergic disorder, and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90 to 0.97) for any neurodevelopmental disorder. For most individually analyzed disorders, the upper limits of the 95% CIs were incompatible with relative increases higher than 10% for 19 disorders, 30% for 7 disorders, and 31% to 79% for the 4 remaining conditions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This nationwide cohort study did not find evidence supporting an increased risk for autoimmune, atopic or allergic, or neurodevelopmental disorders associated with early childhood exposure to aluminum-adsorbed vaccines," the authors wrote.

    &lt;article itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="story_dl"&gt;July 14 (UPI) --&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/public-health/covid-2665435130.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/COVID-19/" target="_blank" title="COVID-19" class="tpstyle"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; cases are on the rise again across the United States, with the biggest increases in parts of the South, Southeast and West Coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 25 states are seeing growth in COVID-19 cases as a summer wave appears to be starting, CBS News reported.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though activity remains "low" nationwide - based on CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html#national-region-trends" target="_blank"&gt;wastewater data&lt;/a&gt; - it's up from "very low" the week before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the biggest increases in emergency room visits for COVID-19 have happened in the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast. In those areas, rates are now the highest they've been since February and March, CBS News added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health experts had been watching for a possible summer spike, as new versions of the virus spread across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent CDC &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/25-0451_article" target="_blank"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; shows that COVID-19 now seems to follow a twice-a-year pattern: Cases usually peak once in the summer (July through September) and again in the winter (from December through February).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our analysis revealed biannual COVID-19 peaks in late summer and winter, a pattern that is expected to persist as long as the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and cyclical S1 diversity continues," CDC scientists wrote.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S1 diversity refers to ongoing changes in a key part of the virus's spike protein - specifically the S1 region, which helps the virus bind to human cells, CBS News reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC is also warning about another virus that's spreading more than usual right now: Parvovirus B19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people who catch this virus don't get very sick. But some develop &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/pulmonology/influenza-2665039558.html" target="_blank"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;-like symptoms, including fever, muscle aches and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pregnant women are at higher risk for complications from parvovirus B19. The CDC says they should take extra steps to protect themselves such as wearing a mask in high-risk places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chicago, health officials said emergency rooms are seeing a spike in patients with this virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Several of the most recent weeks saw the highest percentage of B19-associated ED visits compared to the same week in all years since 2015," health officials &lt;a href="https://www.chicagohan.org/alert-detail/-/alert-details/46690380?p_r_p_categoryId=undefined" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parvovirus B19 is not the same parvovirus that infects dogs and other canines.&lt;/p&gt;

Do not eat those shellfish that do not open during cooking. Boil shucked oysters at least 3 minutes, or fry them in oil at least 10 minutes at 375°F.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid cross-contamination of cooked seafood and other foods with raw seafood and juices from raw seafood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eat shellfish promptly after cooking and refrigerate leftovers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid exposure of open wounds or broken skin to warm salt or brackish water, or to raw shellfish harvested from such waters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear protective clothing (e.g., gloves) when handling raw shellfish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextModule"&gt;

Now he was unconscious, with a piece of bread lodged in his windpipe. Precious minutes went by as first responders were unable to help him with CPR or the Heimlich maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd7f86" class="body-graf"&gt;In an ambulance on the way to the hospital, the elderly man’s skin was blue, and firefighters worried he was going to die. Palumbo — a fire department captain — used a scissors-like device called Magill forceps to pull the bread from the man’s throat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-63eeeb" class="body-graf"&gt;“We get a lot of calls in the city for choking,” many of which are resolved before emergency responders even get there, Palumbo added. “This was by far the worst one I’ve been on in my career.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-43fff1" class="body-graf"&gt;Fortunately, the man survived and made a full recovery, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f0739e" class="body-graf"&gt;But many elderly people do not. Each year, choking claims the lives of more than 4,100 Americans who are 65 or older. It’s the most vulnerable age group, accounting for about three-quarters of U.S. choking deaths, according to federal health statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-df5ab3" class="body-graf"&gt;The death rate has been relatively steady, but the number has risen, as the size of the nation’s retirement-age population grows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25f858" class="body-graf"&gt;In response, a number of companies are marketing antichoking devices to the elderly. Medical professionals have been debating whether to endorse the products, sold under the names LifeVac, SaveLix, VitalVac and the Dechoker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d90396" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Nathan Charlton, a University of Virginia professor of emergency medicine who advises the American Red Cross on first aid, said there is limited evidence for the products and that the Red Cross is still evaluating them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-47ad75" class="body-graf"&gt;Here’s a look at choking and the best ways to prevent choking deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-649d55" class="body-heading"&gt;Choking is a danger to older adults&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-466e98" class="body-graf"&gt;Choking occurs when food or some other object partially or totally blocks the windpipe, preventing oxygen from reaching the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd91b3" class="body-graf"&gt;Telltale signs include someone reaching for their neck and losing the ability to speak normally. Brain damage can occur after four minutes, and death can come just a few minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f9949c" class="body-graf"&gt;Older adults are at higher risk for a number of reasons. As people get older, mouth and throat muscles can weaken. Older people also make less saliva. Some chronic diseases and medications can make swallowing even harder. Dentures can be a choking risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-83cf04" class="body-heading"&gt;The best ways to stop choking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-369267" class="body-graf"&gt;Choking risk can be reduced by cutting food into small pieces, chewing food slowly, drinking plenty of liquids with meals, and not laughing or talking at the same time you are chewing and swallowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3e1e6b" class="body-graf"&gt;When someone is choking, you can try perhaps the oldest form of first aid: back slaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0c8673" class="body-graf"&gt;There’s also the Heimlich maneuver, named after the doctor credited with devising it in the 1970s. It involves standing behind the choking person, wrapping your arms around their abdomen and — with a balled fist — thrusting inward and upward. The idea is that it forces air out of the lungs, and the obstruction with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-abc19d" class="body-graf"&gt;The American Red Cross recommends alternating back blows and abdominal thrusts in sets of five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d3f02a" class="body-graf"&gt;That’s for situations in which someone is around to help a choking victim. But what if they are alone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6b9729" class="body-graf"&gt;It is possible for someone try to self-administer a Heimlich by thrusting their abdomen against the back of a chair, Charlton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1cb4e1" class="body-graf"&gt;Makers of some the newer anti-choking devices say that’s where their products can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-383a30" class="body-graf"&gt;“Elderly people probably are not capable of diving on a chair or counter,” said Arthur Lih, the founder and chief executive of LifeVac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-ce55cd" class="body-heading"&gt;Antichoking devices aren’t always risk-free&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a0873a" class="body-graf"&gt;They vary in design, but generally the devices look like a face mask attached to a tube or bellows, with a handle at the end. They typically sell for around $30 to $100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e1b7d" class="body-graf"&gt;A choking person dons the mask, pushes down on the handle and then pulls up. That is supposed to create a suction that would pull out the blockage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-06d017" class="body-graf"&gt;Some research suggests at least certain devices can injure the tongue or cause bleeding and swelling in the throat. And the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has reports that some products did not generate enough suction and left people with bruising around the face, lips, and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a4c733" class="body-graf"&gt;An injury report led the FDA to do an inspection and issue a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/dechoker-llc-614629-05102021"&gt;warning letter&lt;/a&gt; to Dechoker in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-073376" class="body-graf"&gt;Manufacturers note their products are registered with the FDA, but that’s not the same as an endorsement. Indeed, the agency last year issued a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/fda-encourages-public-follow-established-choking-rescue-protocols-fda-safety-communication"&gt;notice to consumers&lt;/a&gt; that said it has not approved antichoking devices sold over the counter, because their safety and effectiveness haven’t been established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c730f9" class="body-graf"&gt;Lih said the FDA action was in response to the proliferation of antichoking devices entering the market that vary in design and quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-b79c29" class="body-heading"&gt;More research is needed, choking expert says&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7d0001" class="body-graf"&gt;Right now, the consensus — even among antichoking device manufacturers — is that back blows and abdominal thrusts should always be tried first. (The forceps that Palumbo used are not recommended for the general public.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-41d241" class="body-graf"&gt;Lih said thousands of nursing homes and emergency response agencies have purchased the newer antichoking devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-47c615" class="body-graf"&gt;One example: The police department in Acworth, Georgia, bought about 75 LifeVac devices after an officer last year used her personal device to save an elderly woman. They are now in every patrol car, said Sgt. Eric Mistretta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-17b5a5" class="body-graf"&gt;Manufacturers claim the products have saved thousands of lives across multiple countries, but it’s tricky to document how well they actually work, said Dr. Cody Dunne, a University of Calgary researcher who has tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9a6290" class="body-graf"&gt;The early evidence has come from case reports or small studies that used mannequins and cadavers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b70364" class="body-graf"&gt;“I think the case is definitely being built,” he said, but more rigorous research is needed. For example, a larger study could compare what happened during choking incidents at nursing homes that stock the devices with those that don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0e6c97" class="body-graf"&gt;Dunne noted, however, that evidence for the Heimlich maneuver and back slaps is evolving, too. He co-authored &lt;a href="https://www.resuscitationjournal.com/article/S0300-9572(24)00151-5/fulltext"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; last year that found back blows worked better than the Heimlich or chest compressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-35a18e" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We’re only now getting good evidence on the old choking techniques, let alone these new ones,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 19:13:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxQX0RUWGlIWjljaUFZdHY5alhTN2F0T2dNZ1BMalRVV29HdDFDbHY0TXJqTjFNenp5M0Vmc09QRUk1YUlnXzE1STlFbks2V0hYSWZ6SnBQRjNUZnRxQzA0T3A0NUtoa2p0Mm5rWm1CZW4zVl9tdGNxMlJzdTRNMC1jSE10TVN3bmlJZTdjSUItdDYwZjJrU3dfdDFEa1BFNGVPbi1Cc1NxeFQweXF30gFWQVVfeXFMTjJ1S1FWekJFZVZ6ellKVVJhX3RmdzdPd0dyUkhMZ3pwR2VqLU5kNE1KcmVyd1Utcm5UQ1gzU0xVM0VNQmtrd3BXck5WSlF5WE42QUJzdkE</guid></item><item><title>需要睾酮增强吗？也许尝试一些Ozempic - Gizmodo | Need a Testosterone Boost?

              &lt;p&gt;Is there anything that Ozempic and drugs like it &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; do? A study out today finds that GLP-1 medications often raise men’s testosterone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists in St. Louis, Missouri, led the research, which studied men taking one of several GLP-1 drugs for their type 2 diabetes or obesity. On average, men’s testosterone rose significantly after they started taking a GLP-1, with many reaching normal levels. The findings suggest these weight loss drugs can also have reproductive health benefits for men, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Testosterone is important to both men’s and women’s health, but it’s especially vital to the former. In men, it helps maintain muscle mass, bone density, and fertility, to name a few functions. People who develop type 2 diabetes or obesity often experience declining T levels. Conversely, people who lose weight or get their blood sugar under control tend to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/advance-article/doi/10.1210/clinem/dgaf137/8058933"&gt;regain&lt;/a&gt; this lost testosterone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the study authors, however, there isn’t much research looking into what happens to men and their testosterone once they start taking GLP-1s like semaglutide (the active ingredient in the diabetes drug Ozempic and the obesity drug Wegovy). And they wanted to better understand the broader health benefits of these medications beyond weight loss alone.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team analyzed over 200 men with type 2 diabetes or obesity who were prescribed a GLP-1 (semaglutide, tirzepatide, or the older GLP-1 dulaglutide) and who were not taking added testosterone or other hormones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The men’s blood sugar control and weight improved, as expected, with an average weight loss of 10%—and so did their testosterone. Men’s average total and free testosterone levels rose noticeably from their baseline. Only 53% of men had normal T levels before GLP-1 treatments; afterward, the same was true for 77% of men. The team’s findings were presented Monday at the Endocrine Society’s annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The T-boosting effects of GLP-1 therapy didn’t seem quite as large as those seen with other weight loss treatments, particularly surgery. These drugs offer their own advantages, though, according to lead study researcher Shellsea Portillo Canales.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“It’s less dramatic than the rise seen after bariatric surgery, which typically causes rapid and substantial hormonal shifts,” Portillo Canales, an endocrinology fellow at SSM Health St. Louis University Hospital, told Gizmodo. “However, the benefit of GLP-1s is that they are non-invasive, more accessible, and can help improve testosterone naturally, especially when combined with sustained weight loss.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The improvement in men’s testosterone levels correlated well with how many pounds they shed, suggesting that weight loss is the primary driver of this effect. But Portillo Canales doesn’t rule out that other factors, like improved insulin resistance and lower inflammation, could matter, too.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers would like to further confirm this link through prospective studies that proactively track men and their testosterone levels once on GLP-1 therapy. But given that these patients are already taking these drugs for their diabetes or obesity, the potential boost in testosterone could be seen as a nifty bonus at the very least. Just be careful, though. Portillo Canales notes that if men stop taking a GLP-1 and start to gain back weight, their testosterone levels might sink back down along with it.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

A new study found that erythritol exposure reduced nitric oxide, increased vessel constrictors, impaired clot-busting abilities, and boosted free radical production in these cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes create a higher risk environment for clotting and reduced blood flow to the brain. Researchers caution that while the study was conducted in cells, it adds to growing evidence of erythritol’s potential health harms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Erythritol exposure made brain blood vessel cells more constricted and prone to clotting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Free radical production increased, while protective clot-busting compounds decreased.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even typical serving sizes of erythritol could have measurable cellular effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Colorado&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From low-carb ice cream to keto protein bars to “sugar-free” soda, the decades-old sweetener erythritol is everywhere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But new University of Colorado Boulder research shows the popular sugar substitute and specialty food additive comes with serious downsides, impacting brain cells in numerous ways that can boost risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111614"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and a packet of sweetener." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sweetener-stroke-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;For those who consume multiple servings per day, the impact, presumably, could be worse. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study adds to the evidence suggesting that non-nutritive sweeteners that have generally been purported to be safe, may not come without negative health consequences,” said senior author Christopher DeSouza, professor of integrative physiology and director of the Integrative Vascular Biology Lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2001, erythritol is a sugar alcohol, often produced by fermenting corn and found in hundreds of products. It has almost no calories, is about 80% as sweet as table sugar, and has negligible impact on insulin levels, making it a favorite for people trying to lose weight, keep their blood sugar in check or avoid carbohydrates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But recent research has begun to shed light on its risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One recent study involving 4,000 people in the U.S. and Europe found that men and women with higher circulating levels of erythritol were significantly more likely to have a heart attack or stroke within the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeSouza and first author Auburn Berry, a graduate student in his lab, set out to understand what might be driving that increased risk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers in the lab treated human cells that line blood vessels in the brain for three hours with about the same amount of erythritol contained in a typical sugar-free beverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They observed that the treated cells were altered in numerous ways: They expressed significantly less nitric oxide, a molecule that relaxes and widens blood vessels, and more endothelin-1, a protein that constricts blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, when challenged with a clot-forming compound called thrombin, cellular production of the natural clot-busting compound t-PA was “markedly blunted.” The erythritol-treated cells also produced more reactive oxygen species (ROS), a.k.a. “free radicals,” metabolic byproducts which can age and damage cells and inflame tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Big picture, if your vessels are more constricted and your ability to break down blood clots is lowered, your risk of stroke goes up,” said Berry. “Our research demonstrates not only that, but how erythritol has the potential to increase stroke risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeSouza notes that their study used only a serving-size worth of the sugar substitute.  For those who consume multiple servings per day, the impact, presumably, could be worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors caution that their study was a laboratory study, conducted on cells, and larger studies in people are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, De Souza encourages consumers to read labels, looking for erythritol or “sugar alcohol” on the label. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the epidemiological study that inspired our work, and now our cellular findings, we believe it would be prudent for people to monitor their consumption of non-nutrient-sweeteners such as this one,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and neurology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bdd1d4cedc93d0dccfced5dcd1d1fdded2d1d2cfdcd9d293d8d9c8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lisa Marshall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://colorado.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Colorado&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lisa Marshall – University of Colorado&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The non-nutritive sweetener erythritol adversely affects brain microvascular endothelial cell function&lt;/a&gt;” by Auburn Berry et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The non-nutritive sweetener erythritol adversely affects brain microvascular endothelial cell function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experimental aim of this study was to determine, in vitro, the effect of the non-nutritive sweetener erythritol on brain microvascular endothelial cell oxidative stress, nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin (ET)-1 production, as well as tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMECs) were cultured and treated with 6 mM erythritol, equivalent to a typical amount of erythritol (30 g) in an artificially sweetened beverage, for 3 h.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was significantly higher in hCMECs treated with erythritol (204 ± 32% vs. 105 ± 4%) as well as the expression of antioxidant proteins, superoxide dismutase-1 [332.1 ± 16.2 vs. 214.9 ± 4.7 arbitrary units (AU); &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002] and catalase (30.9 ± 0.3 vs. 24.4 ± 0.9 AU; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression was not significantly altered (102.8 ± 21.4 vs. 99.0 ± 19.9 AU); the expression of p-eNOS (Ser1177) was lower (52.1 ± 2.1 vs. 77.3 ± 9.1 AU; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and p-eNOS (Thr495) was higher (63.4 ± 8.0 vs. 45.6 ± 6.9 AU; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.006) in hCMECs treated with erythritol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell expression of Big ET-1 was also higher in erythritol-treated cells (56.4 ± 9.8 vs. 40.9 ± 6.5 AU; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.02). Consequently, the endothelial NO production was significantly lower (5.8 ± 0.8 vs. 7.3 ± 0.7 µmol/L) and ET-1 production was significantly higher (34.6 ± 2.3 vs. 26.9 ± 1.5 pg/mL) in response to erythritol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;t-PA release in response to thrombin was significantly blunted in erythritol-treated (from 87.4 ± 6.3 to 87.6 ± 8.3 pg/mL) versus untreated (90.1 ± 5.5 to 110.2 ± 6.4 pg/mL) hCMECs. In summary, erythritol adversely affects oxidative stress, NO production, ET-1 production, and t-PA release in brain microvascular endothelial cells, potentially contributing to the increased risk of ischemic stroke associated with erythritol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW &amp;amp; NOTEWORTHY&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol, a common non-nutritive sweetener, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides novel data, demonstrating that erythritol (at a concentration typically contained in a standard-size commercially available artificially sweetened beverage) adversely affects brain microvascular endothelial cell oxidative stress, eNOS activation and NO production, ET-1 expression, and t-PA release in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 18:59:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE1sOWlqRmJGYURQcElpNDB3YVZXV0tjbl94VjJHMVJiZGFPT0xjU1NkSWlLaFp6M082MWhFQW1NLXN1VEg4U3JLWFIzQk0wZmVkUGdjdGJ1RU1aTlZsRFVEM1RnQzkzb295SmMwSTRQR2U</guid></item></channel></rss>
