How to avoid the plague Health officials say plague bacteria are most often transmitted by flea bites after the fleas acquired the bacteria from infected squirrels, chipmunks or other wild rodents. Dogs and cats can also bring infected fleas into the home. People are urged to keep pets leashed and away from rodent burrows. Both people and pets should avoid touching sick, injured or dead rodents, or feeding any rodents. People can also avoid contact with infected fleas by wearing long pants tucked into boots and by spraying insect repellent with DEET on socks and pant cuffs. Plague symptoms include fever, nausea, weakness and swollen lymph nodes. Plague can be treated with antibiotics if detected early.See more coverage of top California stories here | Download our app | Subscribe to our morning newsletter | Find us on YouTube here and subscribe to our channel

Scientists believe they have discovered a way to test which lifestyle changes could combat the condition, such as adopting the Mediterranean diet and eating less fermented, aged and smoked foods, although genes could also play a factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Previous studies have found 42 genes or genetic markers that may be linked with a raised risk of EDS, but researchers have now found that people who experience excessive sleepiness, known as hypersomnia, even after a full night’s sleep, often have seven key molecules linked&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; to their metabolisms circulating in their bloodstreams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/vegetarian-diet-cuts-risk-of-sleep-apnoea-study-finds-h5w7dgkdq" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vegetarian diet cuts risk of snoring, study finds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The scientists found that foods containing the metabolite tyramine, particularly “fermented and overripe” foods, such as some aged cheeses, smoked meats and alcoholic drinks, and food that is starting to spoil, are linked with a higher risk of EDS, particularly in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The researchers also found that the omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids found in vegetable oils, nuts, seeds and fatty fish commonly eaten in Mediterranean-style diets appear to be linked with a lower risk of EDS, suggesting that dietary changes could help those affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.4"&gt;&lt;div id="f0e44b3f-0324-4168-9469-a788b6275ea2"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Fatty fish such as sardines, and nuts, both prevalent in the Mediterranean diet, could lower the risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="3.5"&gt;&lt;div id="fb1cf023-fe2a-4dc5-aa33-76a60ed7ab3e"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;ADELA STEFAN/500PX/GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The NHS website explains that “excessive daytime sleepiness is different from feeling tired all the time”. It said sufferers may “regularly nap during the day, fall asleep during the day [and] still sleep for long hours at night”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;One study with European participants, which was published in the journal EBioMedicine, estimated that just under one in five people experience sleepiness levels that are significantly above normal several days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dr Tariq Faquih, of the sleep and circadian disorders division at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, the author of the study, said: “The metabolites we’ve identified can certainly be measured with the appropriate tools. We anticipate they’ll be most valuable following an initial assessment, ideally using sleep-lab testing or, at minimum, standardised questionnaires. Testing the metabolite levels will help determine which metabolites may require adjustment, for example through dietary interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Faquih said if people were concerned, they could take online questionnaires or use screening tools such as the &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/snorers-have-you-been-tested-for-sleep-apnoea-yet-g88x9jjdn" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;Epworth Sleepiness Scale&lt;/a&gt; before contacting their GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/foods-keep-you-younger-gvldm2wq7" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;From peanuts to pomegranates — the 19 foods that will keep you young&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;When asked about the symptoms of EDS, he said: “Some may feel constantly drowsy throughout the day, while others might experience sudden and intense sleepiness that leads to unexpected ‘sleep attacks’. In other cases, people may unintentionally fall asleep during quiet, repetitive activities like watching TV or reading. It is not always as sudden but still happens without us meaning to go to sleep.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He added: “Our study suggests diet and genetics may play an important role in EDS. As we learn what’s happening biologically, we are beginning to understand how and why EDS occurs, the early signs that someone might have it and what we can do to help patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;To combat excessive daytime sleepiness, it could be beneficial to consume more food high in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• Fatty fish&lt;br&gt;• Nuts&lt;br&gt;• Seeds&lt;br&gt;• Vegetable oils&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;And for people, particularly men, to eat less food high in tyramine, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• Fermented and pickled food&lt;br&gt;•

class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers found associations with other harmful consequences including asthma, cough, injuries and mental ill health, as well as possible risks of respiratory disease, headaches, poor oral health and substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Su Golder, an associate professor in health science at the University of York and an author of the research, said: “The consistency in the evidence is striking. Across multiple studies, young people who use e-cigarettes are more likely to smoke in the future. These findings support stronger public health measures to protect teens from the risks associated with vaping.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers concluded that although it was not yet possible to definitively say vaping leads children to smoke, precautionary policies to restrict sales and marketing of vapes to young people were needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Ronny Cheung, of the Royal College of Paediatrics, said the study “adds to the mounting evidence that youth vaping is a serious threat to health and wellbeing, with strong links to smoking and other harmful behaviours”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cheung urged the government not to further delay implementing the tobacco and vapes bill, which will limit the flavours, packaging and marketing of vapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously described the rise in children vaping around the world as alarming. Figures compiled &lt;a href="https://ash.org.uk/resources/view/use-of-e-cigarettes-among-young-people-in-great-britain" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;by Action on Smoking and Health&lt;/a&gt; this year showed that 20% of 11- to 17-year-olds in Great Britain had tried vaping, amounting to an estimated 1.1 million children, triple the levels in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For the new study, which was published in the journal Tobacco Control, researchers examined 56 reviews, most of which suggested that young people who vape are about three times as likely to start smoking as those who do not vape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Asthma was the most common respiratory health condition, with consistent associations of between 20% and 36% increased risk of being diagnosed with the condition, and a 44% risk of worsening symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers acknowledged that the umbrella reviews were of variable quality and that it was difficult to prove a causal relationship since the evidence was mostly observational. They urged further research to better understand whether vapes are genuinely acting as a gateway to smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jul/29/third-of-uk-teenagers-who-vape-will-go-on-to-start-smoking-research-shows" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Michigan established that a third of UK teenagers who vape will go on to start smoking tobacco, meaning they are as likely to smoke as their peers in the 1970s were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hazel Cheeseman, the chief executive of Action on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/smoking" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Smoking&lt;/a&gt; and Health, said: “The rise in teen vaping in recent years is very concerning and needs urgent action from government. Vapes are effective quit aids for adults who smoke and while they are less harmful than smoking, they are not risk free and should not be used by children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Stephen Burgess, a statistician at the University of Cambridge, said the research showed “that vaping users are more likely to engage in certain behaviours, but whether vaping is truly a cause of these behaviours is beyond the scope of the data”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He added: “The associations demonstrated are both extensive in scope and strong in magnitude – it is clear that vaping users are at higher risk of many diseases than non-users. A causal explanation to the findings is both plausible and consistent with the evidence provided but such a finding can only be made conclusively by a randomised trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ann McNeill, a professor of tobacco addiction at King’s College London, noted that many of the studies on which the researchers drew for the study were “rated critically low or low quality, meaning authors should be extremely cautious before making any conclusions”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She said there could be other reasons for the consistency of the relationship between vaping and cigarette smoking – for example, a young person having a sensation-seeking or impulsive personality. Other research looking at population-level trends in vaping and smoking had found that as youth vaping increased in a population, smoking reduced, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;John Dunne, UK Vaping Industry Association director general, said: “We have seen a lot of research from the scientific community about vaping which does not stand up to scrutiny and this latest study seems to fit the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We need to stop demonising vaping because until the relative risks of cigarettes and vaping are understood by smokers then 220 people will needlessly die in the UK of smoking-related illnesses every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Social Care spokesperson said: “Our health advice is clear, while vapes are less harmful than smoking and can be an effective quit aid for smokers, children and non-smokers should never vape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The worrying rise in youth vaping requires attention – that’s why we commissioned this research, the largest comprehensive review of the health impacts of youth vaping to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We are taking decisive action through the landmark tobacco and vapes bill and single-use vape ban, which will put an end to the cycle of addiction and stop the next generation getting hooked on nicotine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxQOW5rZGpYR2NXTjVveFh1N3ZIaUFKVWJUNW1oQVgxMDlHT295LUtsUFdFZ1QxN2pkMzBGUnN4MFRXaDBhVVFSVERJSmFPQldhWFlsV0hoZ2drNHN6djZOaWJEWl9VM1VCbURNT0RwRzRfNFpVUVhNekxCVTh6akU2VkJ2bUJ4NzdyZndqRWE2emZNcWhtZmNYS0d0V3BCN3NHNVVrS3Bwck1tbDQ0MUE</guid></item><item><title>南太浩湖居民鼠疫检测呈阳性- KOLO | 8新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxQektSVGZwaHJ0VEY1TU1TUVhPZHVWcy11VWZYQ2xyQTZDWlZ4Y2htaWVRSEpwNXR6M3ZtcEFjcVIyY2tYaklpMWtjblphTE5UUE04TThrcm90S3doWS1rdVh5Q1FfWFZrRFJ3MXhpOFJKVVIyU2dGeDhMZnV1Vmg2Y3ctZUtXdGxoa0HSAZ4BQVVfeXFMT2ZNWUJ5NjlmUjBjVXZ1aHFMY3F4ZWdRMlZkRkJ0czdjQnBhSmNhN3dWWjVrbUswR2FFTWxhcENPMHQxTkx4QzV2eDg3Mks2eHlubFBwSHcwUmJwaGphd2VKR2RGbkpHdHpxdVhDUFkzR2FWUmp4VDlmbVE3ZTduWWEzRlkxQ0N3WGpsbEgzQlhKRF95ZUNqMktDQ3hDUnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, California (KOLO) - A South Lake Tahoe resident has tested positive for the plague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;El Dorado County health officials say the unidentified resident is under the care of a medical professional and is recovering at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Officials say they believe the person may have been bitten by an infected flea while camping in the South Lake Tahoe area. Health officials are investigating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Plague is naturally present in many parts of California, including higher elevation areas of El Dorado County, said Kyle Fliflet, El Dorado County’s Acting Director of Public Health. “It’s important that individuals take precautions for themselves and their pets when outdoors, especially while walking, hiking and or camping in areas where wild rodents are present,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The bacteria that causes the plague, Yersinia pestis, is most often transmitted by the bite of fleas that have acquired the bacteria from infected squirrels, chipmunks, and other wild rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Symptoms typically show up within two weeks of exposure to an infected animal or flea. Symptoms include fever, nausea, weakness, and swollen lymph nodes. The disease can be effectively treated with antibiotics if detected early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Prior to this case, the most recent case came in 2020, with the patient likely being infected in the South Lake Tahoe area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Health officials say you should never feed squirrels, touch injured or dead rodents, and never allow your pets to play with sick, injured or dead rodents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="copyright |"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Copyright 2025 KOLO.

Dr Fiona Willer, the president of Dietitians Australia, worries about the proliferation of the devices and questions whether some people may have “fallen down a wellness rabbit hole”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-glucose" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;What is glucose?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Glucose, the sugar in our blood, is “there to help fuel all of our cells – our muscle cells, brain cells, all of them – and so we do need sugar in our blood. It’s a bit like the petrol in a car,” Willer says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Any form of carbohydrate that we eat, whether that’s lollies or wholegrain bread, is turned into glucose, which makes its way into our bloodstream.” The body can also recycle glucose from the stored energy of food we’ve already eaten, Willer says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Those with diabetes need to monitor their glucose levels because their bodies have &lt;a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/diabetes-and-insulin" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;trouble making or using insulin&lt;/a&gt; – the hormone created by the pancreas that helps move glucose from our bloodstream into the body’s cells to make energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The blood glucose of people who don’t have regulation issues still fluctuates across the day, going up and down depending on what we eat, physical activity level, as well as things such as whether we’re ill or going through puberty, Willer says. “For people who don’t have diabetes, that fluctuation will occur within a tighter range, while for people who do have diabetes, their blood glucose levels stray outside of what we would call the reference range.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-do-cgms-do" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;What do CGMs do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People with diabetes previously had to use a finger prick test to measure their blood glucose levels. The CGM is a relatively new device that &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/continuous-glucose-monitors-cgms-for-type-2-diabetes-when-and-for-whom-are-they-useful" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;uses a sensor to measure glucose via the fluid between cells every few minutes&lt;/a&gt; and then sends the reading to a receiver or smartphone app. For people with diabetes, the reading can then help them manage their glucose levels by influencing how they eat or using some glucose-modifying drugs such as insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Clinical endocrinologist Prof Jenny Gunton says CGMs can “hugely improve the quality of life” for people living with type 1 diabetes, as well as pregnant women who have gestational diabetes and people with type 2 diabetes on insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-about-people-who-dont-have-diabetes" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;What about people who don’t have diabetes?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Gunton, who heads the Centre for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/diabetes" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, Obesity and Endocrinology Research at the Westmead Institute for Medical Research, says outside of these groups, wearing a CGM can be useful to understand blood glucose levels after various foods and exercise, but warns that “like any device that gives lots of information, CGMs can sometimes increase anxiety and stress”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They are also expensive. For people who aren’t eligible for a government subsidy, it can cost more than $100 for a sensor that lasts just 14 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="should-people-without-diabetes-use-them" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;Should people without diabetes use them?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A study led by the University of the Sunshine Coast in 2022 found CGMs &lt;a href="https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/ijsnem/33/2/article-p121.xml" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;provide little benefit for healthy athletes without diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.

loss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, can be achieved with foods high in fiber and protein.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Keep in mind, a boiled egg provides 7 grams of protein and is the most complete whole protein-based food,” she explained. “I always encourage whole foods first.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Carnahan advised people to focus on foods “in their whole state,” which include apples, bananas, carrot sticks, nuts and seeds, natural peanut butter, and plain Greek yogurt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“These are all great foods that just take a little planning and are easy to consume with little preparation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data shows that more than half of daily calories in the UK and the US come from

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dropcap"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;cientists recently discovered a microbe with one of the tiniest genomes on Earth. More surprising, the creature is almost entirely dependent on its host: Its genes don’t support any of the functions of metabolism, one of the key processes of life. As such, it challenges fundamental notions of what it means to be a living organism.&lt;/p&gt;
      
    &lt;p&gt;The discovery was “pure serendipity,” says Takuro Nakayama, an evolutionary microbiologist at the University of Tsukuba in Japan. Takayama wanted to study the many microbes that live within a single-celled marine dinoflagellate, &lt;em&gt;Citharistes regius&lt;/em&gt;, a kind of plankton. But when he and his colleagues sequenced the genes of this microbial community, they kept turning up tiny, odd chunks of DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that these DNA chunks belong to some unusual archaea—a branch on the tree of life populated by single-celled microbes that can often survive in extreme environments. (Archaea are similar to bacteria, but distinct in their structure, genetics, and metabolism.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did Sukunaarchaeum end up with such a strikingly tiny genome?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nakayama and his colleagues proposed the name Sukunaarchaeum mirabile for the newly-discovered microbe: Sukunaarchaeum after the Japanese dwarf deity &lt;em&gt;Sukuna-biko-na&lt;/em&gt;, and mirabile for marvelous. At only 238,000 base pairs, the number of genes in the DNA of Sukunaarchaeum is smaller than that of any other known archaea. The scientists described &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.02.651781v1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;their finding&lt;/a&gt; in a bioRxiv preprint earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how did Sukunaarchaeum end up with such a strikingly tiny genome? Over the course of evolution, genetic instructions for life often become increasingly complex. But evolution can also go in the other direction, leading to greater simplicity in the genome. This so-called genomic reduction, where organisms end up with fewer genes than their ancestors, is typically observed in the domains of bacteria and archaea. What struck Nakayama and his colleagues about Sukunaarchaeum was the extent of reduction and specialization in its genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its stripped down genome, Sukunaarchaeum appears to be completely dependent on its host, &lt;em&gt;C. regius&lt;/em&gt;, for essential energy and nutrients. “It likely cannot produce its own cellular building blocks,” notes Nakayama. “No previously discovered microbe has shown such an extreme degree of metabolic dependence.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sukunaarchaeum seems to almost inhabit a new category of life, suspended somewhere between archaea and virus. It is like viruses—which aren’t typically considered to be “alive”—in that it has a tiny genome and is totally dependent on its host for metabolism. But unlike a virus, Sukunaarchaeum has its own ribosomes, cellular structures that synthesize proteins, and it can replicate itself without the help of a host.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get a sense of just how unusual Sukunaarchaeum is, the researchers decided to scan the oceans for potential relatives. They analyzed environmental genetic sequence data from marine environments all over the world, focusing on spots where &lt;em&gt;C. regius&lt;/em&gt; is known to live. Using a database called the Tara Oceans project, they discovered a vast array of sequences that are comparable to that of Sukunaarchaeum, which they hypothesize could represent a new, deeply branching archaeal lineage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Nakayama, this additional finding suggests that many more microbes that challenge the definition of life may be out there, living in what Nakayama calls “microbial dark matter,” or microbes that can’t be cultivated in the lab. “The extreme, virus-like lifestyle we hypothesize for Sukunaarchaeum is a perfect example of the surprising outcomes found in this ‘natural laboratory of evolution,’” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mart Krupovic, a virologist and microbiologist at Institut Pasteur in France who wasn’t involved in the study, called the finding “remarkable.” Krupovic has studied giant viruses that, like Sukunaarchaeum, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4161/cib.18624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;defy categorization&lt;/a&gt;. These giant viruses have evolved larger and more complex genomes that include some of the genes for DNA translation, a characteristic thought to be reserved for cellular life. “I think that is fascinating,” says Krupovic, “how little we still know about the world which surrounds us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, Nakayama wants to culture and isolate Sukunaarchaeum in the lab, not just its genes, and take an image or video of it. He hopes this will help him better understand its biology, ecology, and how it is built—how it achieves this curious feat of living on the edge of life. &lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-13765" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png?fm=png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;BELOIT, Wis. -- The Wisconsin Department of Health Services on Tuesday identified two public locations where people might have been exposed to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two locations were the Pilot Travel Center #289 at 3001 Milwaukee Road in Beloit and the Flying J Travel Center #470 at 1191 70th Ave. in Roberts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exposure at the Roberts location may have happened between 7:15 a.m. and 10 a.m. on Aug. 4 and the exposure at the Beloit location may have occurred between 11:45 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. on Aug. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were at one of the locations during the date and times identified, check your immunization status as soon as possible to ensure you have received an MMR vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DHS said the exposure is from an out-of-state traveler who visited Wisconsin.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This study links the MIND diet to less neuron loss in the hippocampus, which is key to memory and learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participants who followed the MIND diet closely had a 22% lower chance of hippocampal sclerosis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These findings build on evidence that food choices may influence brain aging and dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Everyone wants to protect their memories. The idea of forgetting familiar faces or treasured moments drives many people to look for ways to protect their brain health. That motivation has fueled growing interest in lifestyle habits—especially diet—that could help keep the mind sharp.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One part of the brain researchers are particularly focused on is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-to-improve-your-memory-8415078" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the hippocampus&lt;/a&gt;, a hub for learning and memory. When it sustains damage in the form of hippocampal sclerosis (a severe loss of neurons in this region) it’s often linked to dementia. These cells don’t grow back.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study, published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, offers intriguing evidence that what you eat may influence the odds of developing this type of brain damage.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It examined &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mind-diet-dementia-study-11748383" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;, an eating pattern built to support cognitive health, and found that people who followed it more closely were less likely to lose neurons in their hippocampus. It’s a new piece in the larger puzzle of how diet may help preserve brain function with age.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers analyzed data from 809 participants in the long-running Rush Memory and Aging Project, all of whom had agreed to donate their brains for research after death. None had dementia when they joined the study, and they completed annual food questionnaires for up to 18 years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Using these detailed diet records, scientists calculated a MIND diet score for each person, with higher scores reflecting closer adherence to the diet. After death, brain tissue was examined for signs of hippocampal sclerosis, hippocampal sclerosis with limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE-NC), and general hippocampal neuronal loss.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The participants had an average age of 91 at death, and most were white.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Those with the highest MIND diet scores had about a 22% lower chance of having hippocampal sclerosis compared to those with the lowest scores. They were also less likely to have hippocampal sclerosis alongside limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE-NC) and had less overall neuronal loss in the hippocampus.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The link held even after accounting for age, sex, education, total calorie intake, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7893378/these-13-things-could-make-you-more-likely-to-get-alzheimers-according-to-a-new-study/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, Alzheimer’s pathology and vascular disease in the brain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study also found that hippocampal sclerosis explained about 21% of the connection between the MIND diet and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-habits-dementia-study-11695904" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower odds of dementia&lt;/a&gt; at the time of death.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Still, the authors note important limitations: the study was observational, so it cannot prove the diet prevented brain damage. Other factors not measured could play a role. And because the participants were almost entirely non-Hispanic white older adults, the findings may not apply to all populations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even though this study can’t prove that the MIND diet directly prevents neuron loss, it builds on earlier research showing the diet’s link to slower cognitive decline and a lower risk of dementia. Taken together, the evidence paints a consistent picture: your daily food choices may play a meaningful role in how well your brain ages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-mind-diet-meal-plan-for-cognitive-health-11700108" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;MIND diet&lt;/a&gt; isn’t about perfection or rigid rules. It’s about tipping the balance toward foods known to nourish the brain. That means: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eating &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-vegetable-for-better-gut-health-11717168" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;leafy greens&lt;/a&gt; most days of the week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Including berries a few times per week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choosing nuts, beans, whole grains and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-olive-oil-good-for-you-8766002" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;olive oil regularly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eating fish and poultry more often than red meat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limiting foods like butter, full-fat cheese, pastries, sweets, fried food and fast food&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If that sounds like a big leap from where you are now, start small. Picture your week of meals and identify one easy win: maybe swapping your usual side of fries for a green salad a couple of times, or tossing a handful of walnuts into your afternoon yogurt. Keep &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8062002/blueberry-recipes-to-make-forever/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;a carton of blueberries&lt;/a&gt; in the fridge—or a bag in the freezer—so you can grab a brain-friendly snack without thinking twice. If you cook with butter by habit, try drizzling olive oil over vegetables instead and notice how quickly the swap becomes second nature.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you're ready for a bigger overhaul, trying something like our weeklong &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/simple-7-day-cognitive-health-meal-plan-11685540" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cognitive Health Meal Plan&lt;/a&gt; could be a great next step. We also love MIND diet recipes like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chicken-spinach-salad-with-creamy-feta-dressing-8417420" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Chicken &amp;amp; Spinach Salad with Creamy Feta Dressing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lemon-garlic-chicken-casserole-8363311" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Lemon-Garlic Chicken Casserole&lt;/a&gt;, since they include big flavor, plenty of veggies and some whole grains, too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And these changes aren’t just good for your hippocampus. They may also improve heart health, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-avoid-for-chronic-inflammation-8644317" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and help you feel more energetic day to day—benefits you can notice long before any memory test. The beauty of the MIND diet is that you don’t have to overhaul your entire plate at once; you just have to start leaning, meal by meal, in the right direction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is the first human study to show that following the MIND diet is linked with a lower likelihood of hippocampal sclerosis, a type of neuron loss tied to dementia. While it can’t prove the diet directly prevents brain cell loss, it adds to a growing body of evidence that what you eat matters for brain health. Focusing on plant-rich meals, healthy fats, and limiting processed foods may be one step toward protecting your memory in the years ahead.&lt;br&gt;

Kennedy Jr. speaks as he attends a press conference with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz to discuss health insurance reform, at the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 23, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Kevin Mohatt | Reuters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Healthy Returns newsletter, which brings the latest health-care news straight to your inbox. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/healthy-returns-newsletter/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to receive future editions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/09/rfk-jr-cdc-panel-vaccines.html"&gt;gutted a key government vaccine panel&lt;/a&gt;, saying it was necessary to eliminate what he called "persistent conflicts of interest" on the committee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2837784" target="_blank"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; from the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy &amp;amp; Economics appears to challenge that argument. Conflicts on that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel had been at "historic lows for years" before Kennedy restacked it with new members, some of whom are widely known vaccine critics, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the medical journal JAMA on Monday, also found that the type of conflict considered to be the "most concerning" – income from vaccine makers – had been virtually eliminated among members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conflicts of interest rates were also low on a separate panel of advisors to the Food and Drug Administration called the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, or VRBPAC, according to the research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both groups are crucial to shaping U.S. vaccine policy: While the FDA committee advises the agency on whether to approve shots, the CDC panel determines who is eligible for jabs and whether insurers should cover them. The panels are typically made up of top experts in infectious diseases, pediatrics, immunology and public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has long contended that the advisors on those panels have close ties to the pharmaceutical industry. At his first Senate confirmation hearing in January, Kennedy claimed that 97% of the CDC panel members had conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Before he was confirmed, I saw this 97% number and thought, wow, that's some serious stuff. But after looking at the vaccine data myself, I certainly couldn't see anything at that scale," said the study's lead author Genevieve Kanter, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Southern California, in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it will be reassuring to the public and to the [Trump] administration that issues that we thought were pretty serious or in the past were serious are not anymore," she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research comes as Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic himself, overhauls federal health agencies and pursues efforts that could change immunization policy and undermine vaccine uptake in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USC researchers analyzed reported financial conflicts of interest among experts on the two vaccine panels between 2000 and 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's how conflicts of interest disclosures work on the panels, which meet several times a year to review vaccines: For each product being discussed, members must say if they have a tie to the vaccine maker or a competitor and disclose the nature of the relationship. People on the panel with conflicts either receive a waiver to participate if they are deemed to provide essential expertise, while those with conflicts considered too significant are recused. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, an average of 6.2% of ACIP members and 1.9% of VRBPAC members have reported a financial conflict of interest at any given meeting, according to the paper. During that period, less than 1% of reported conflicts on both panels were tied to personal income from vaccine makers, including consulting fees, stock, royalties or ownership. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rates of reported conflicts among ACIP members fell to 5% by 2024, and stayed below 4% among VRBPAC members since 2010, including 10 years where there were no reported conflicts at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conflict of interest rates were significantly higher in the early 2000s, peaking at around 43% for ACIP in 2000 and 27% for VRBPAC in 2007, the researchers found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study said the decline over the years may be due to policy changes in 2007 that cracked down on conflicts of interest on the FDA panel, and "greater awareness and scrutiny" of conflicts in agency decision-making. It's not clear when exactly the CDC committee began to do the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the study period, the most frequently reported conflict of interest was research support, which is generally considered less of a concern than financial ties associated with personal income. Kanter said that's a reflection of the panel members' areas of expertise that are relevant to evaluating the safety, efficacy and applicability of shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The dominant conflicts were grant support for research. In a way that makes sense because, who do we want on these committees? It's people with expertise on how to conduct research on these vaccines," Kanter said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These conflicts are not about personal gain, but related to measures of expertise." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some of the rates appear to be higher with ACIP members than with people on the VRBPAC panel, Kanter said it is not comparable because the CDC provides "far less granular" data on conflicts of interest. She added that the FDA panel typically reviews one product at a time during a meeting, while the CDC committee evaluates multiple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kanter said it is important to examine conflicts of interest and the influence of the pharmaceutical industry in many aspects of health-care regulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she added that "if we do want to focus on conflicts of interest, there may be other areas where the prevalence is a greater concern than what we've seen here with these vaccine panels." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at &lt;a href="http://nbcuni.com/?__source=newsletter%7Chealthyreturns" target="_blank"&gt;annikakim.constantino@nbcuni.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Latest in health care: UnitedHealth's Buffett bounce holds for now&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett was just what the doctor ordered to stabilize &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-5"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/UNH/"&gt;UnitedHealth Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; shares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Hathaway's 13F filing revealing a new stake of more than 5 million shares has helped lift the stock back above $300 — a far cry from the 52-week low of under $235 that it hit earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This marks Berkshire's first foray into the complicated area of managed care. David Tepper's Appaloosa Fund also provided a vote of confidence in the embattled health care giant's stock, boosting its stake to 2.5 million shares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For both, it's a bet on recovery, but analysts say the wait could take well over a year.When assessing the purchases, Baird analyst Michael Ha invoked Warren Buffett's own words about "complicated, uncertain investments" which belong in the "too hard pile." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a note to clients, Ha wrote that UnitedHealth's issues extend beyond pricing in its Medicare Advantage plans to real structural problems with its Optum health physician unit that aren't as easily fixed. Ha added that "near-term execution risk is high and we see potential for the situation to worsen over the next 12-18 months before improving."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, on a technical basis, UnitedHealth shares are trading above their 50-day moving average for the first time since the company first lowered guidance in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Bertha at &lt;a href="http://bertha.coombs@nbcuni.com" target="_blank"&gt;bertha.coombs@nbcuni.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Latest in health-care tech: Epic touts new AI tools at annual Users Group Meeting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108185297" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;Epic's campus in Verona, Wisconsin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Courtesy: Epic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is Ashley, reporting live from Verona, Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's that time of year again! I'm attending Epic's annual &lt;a href="https://www.ugm.epic.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Users Group Meeting&lt;/a&gt;, where thousands of health-care executives flock to the company's 1,670-acre headquarters to learn about the company's latest products and features. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epic is a health-care software company best known for its electronic health record, or EHR software. An EHR is a digital version of a patient's medical record that's maintained by doctors and nurses over time. Epic is the dominant EHR vendor in the U.S., and its technology is used in 3,300 hospitals and 73,000 clinics and by 325 million patients around the globe, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence was front and center at UGM this year, much like it was &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/21/epic-systems-ugm-2024-ai-tools-in-mychart-cosmos-.html"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;. During a three-hour-long executive address Tuesday morning, Epic executives shared updates about the roughly 200 new AI features it's been developing for patients, clinicians and payers. Keep an eye out for additional coverage from CNBC that explains some of these upcoming features in more detail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epic confirmed that it is developing its own AI-powered clinical documentation tool, which was one of the most anticipated announcements of this year's event. These tools, which are often called AI scribes, are able to draft clinical notes in real time as doctors consensually record their visits with patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fiercely competitive AI scribing market has taken off as health-care executives search for solutions to help reduce staff burnout and daunting administrative workloads. Some AI scribing startups like Abridge and Ambience Healthcare have raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors, and there was a lot of speculation about whether Epic would ultimately join the fray. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it is working on this feature in partnership with Microsoft, and that it will be available for limited use early next year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"AI is here, it's accelerating, you can't wish it away, you've got to keep up with it," Epic's President Sumit Rana said during the address. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presentations took place in Epic's 11,400-seat underground auditorium called Deep Space, which is just one of the many &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/01/inside-epic-systems-mythical-campus-a-world-away-from-wall-street-.html"&gt;unique facilities&lt;/a&gt; on campus. Epic's office buildings are themed, with many inspired by science fiction and stories like "The Wizard of Oz," the Harry Potter series and "Alice in Wonderland." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UGM meetings are also themed, and Epic executives famously take the stage dressed in costume. This year's theme was "sci-fi," and Epic's 82-year-old founder and CEO Judy Faulkner wore a purple wig, bright green shoes and a metallic vest that appeared inspired by the fictional character, Buzz Lightyear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNBC had the opportunity to sit down with Faulkner earlier this summer in a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/16/how-epics-82-year-old-ceo-judy-faulkner-built-her-software-factory.html"&gt;rare interview,&lt;/a&gt; where she reflected on her 46 years at the company's helm. During her presentation on Tuesday, Faulkner discussed Epic's AI initiatives and roadmap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are combining the intelligence and curiosity of the human being with the investigative capabilities of gen AI," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the new features Epic teased on Tuesday are still several months, or over a year, away. But it's clear that Epic is leaning in on AI, and they didn't let this year's UGM attendees forget it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about CNBC's interview with Faulkner &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/16/how-epics-82-year-old-ceo-judy-faulkner-built-her-software-factory.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Ashley at &lt;a href="mailto:ashley.capoot@nbcuni.com." target="_blank"&gt;ashley.capoot@nbcuni.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 20:03:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>研究人员发现马拉松跑步与癌症之间存在奇怪的联系- Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNVXJLa0lRS1pZQTczREg1bmlMOENYd3h4dkhPbVVkUEowMWtOd01DYkxObjNhY1d1bTViZkVweGo1eTN6QWdSQ0RmVmtQcC1KWGcxc242SXBtdUl2QmFuV1UtSjZWdHQ5Y1VmRU1pNUJqV0tuVDRjSWFCUU9OanhydWRGcEpZa25tNW9Ec1NqRG1SWlcxZnZJQzlsdFg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none "&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Some of the most physically fit people in the world may have a unique health risk. New research uncovers a possible link between marathon running and colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oncologists at the Inova Schar Cancer Institute in Virginia conducted the study, which examined the colons of relatively young people who had run several long-distance races. They found these runners had a much higher rate of having potentially dangerous adenomas (a type of polyp) than would be expected for their age. Though the findings are preliminary and require more confirmation, they may point to a real connection between colorectal cancer and extreme physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It tells us there’s a signal here,” David Lieberman, a gastroenterologist and professor emeritus at Oregon Health and Science University not affiliated with the study, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/health/running-colon-cancer.html"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the New York Times Tuesday. “We wouldn’t have expected these rates of high-risk adenomas, which are cancer precursor lesions, in an age group like this.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A mysterious trend&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lead researcher Timothy Cannon was inspired to perform the study after he treated three young patients with colorectal cancer, all of whom had run ultramarathons (defined as any race longer than 26.2 miles). Not only were his patients fit, but they were also much younger than the typical case, the oldest being 40.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In 2022, Cannon and his colleagues &lt;a href="https://www.inovanewsroom.org/expert-commentary/2022/10/endurance-sports-and-colorectal-cancer-is-there-a-connection/"&gt;began&lt;/a&gt; recruiting endurance athletes for their prospective study. The volunteers had all run at least two ultramarathons or five regular marathons; they also had no family history of colorectal cancer or other apparent risk factors. All told, 100 athletes between the ages of 35 and 50 took part and were given colonoscopies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers went looking for advanced adenomas in the colons of their volunteers, relatively large or otherwise unusual polyps. Though these growths are themselves benign, they have a higher risk of turning cancerous than other polyps. Then they compared the rate of finding these polyps in their athletes to historical trends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 1.2% of people in their 40s at average risk for colorectal cancer would be expected to have advanced adenomas, according to the researchers. By sharp contrast, 15% of the runners they studied had them, while nearly half had polyps in general.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Consideration of refined screening strategies for this population is warranted,” the researchers wrote in their study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Much left to understand&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team &lt;a href="https://www.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/ABSTRACT491966"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; its results earlier this year at the annual conference of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. That means this study hasn’t yet undergone the formal peer-review process. The authors are also quick to note their work isn’t definitive proof that endurance running can cause colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Assuming this link is causative, there remains the burning question of why. As even weekend 5k joggers will know, running can occasionally trigger bouts of gastrointestinal distress (the namesake &lt;a href="https://sportsmedicine.mayoclinic.org/news/how-can-i-prevent-runners-diarrhea/"&gt;runner’s diarrhea&lt;/a&gt;). These injuries are sometimes caused by temporarily restricted blood flow to the intestines that damages nearby cells. It’s possible, the researchers speculate, that extreme runners who regularly experience this blood flow loss can develop the sort of chronic inflammation that makes cancer more likely to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, though, that’s only one hypothesis for what may be happening here. The researchers say future studies should try to confirm their findings as well as untangle the causes and risk factors that could explain this potential higher risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All that said, this research shouldn’t scare anyone away from running or any other form of cardio. The many health benefits of regular physical activity—which importantly include a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/health-benefits/lowers-risk-of-cancer.html"&gt;lower risk&lt;/a&gt; of at least eight different types of cancer—still far outweigh the risks for the average person.&lt;/p&gt;
              
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Covid-19 vaccine. Previously, the CDC advised vaccination for everyone six months and older with the latest available dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC currently advises that Covid-19 vaccinations for children aged six months through 17 years should be determined through “shared clinical decision-making”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The AAP recommends vaccination for anyone under 18 who is at higher risk of serious illness from Covid-19, resides in a longterm care or congregate living facility, has not previously been vaccinated, or shares a household with someone at elevated risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The academy has been making pediatric immunization recommendations since the 1930s, that has not changed,” Dr Susan Kressly, president of the AAP, told &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/leading-pediatrician-group-recommends-covid-vaccine-infants-toddlers/story?id=124756899" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“But what has changed is that this year, we’re doing it in the environment of misinformation, which makes it more important than ever that we provide clear and confident guidance, because the majority of American families really depend on us for this guidance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;AAP says infants and toddlers between six and 23 months face the greatest risk for severe outcomes from Covid-19 and vaccination offers protection against serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even as medical groups continue to disagree with federal agencies, insurers often &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/acip-cdc-and-insurance-coverage-of-vaccines-in-the-united-states/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;base coverage&lt;/a&gt; on guidelines from the CDC’s advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP). If ACIP declines to endorse a vaccine, families may have to pay out of pocket, and the shot may not be provided through the federally funded Vaccines for Children program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The US Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; Human Services (HHS) communications director, Andrew Nixon, responded to the AAP’s updated recommendations with the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The American people deserve confidence that medical recommendations are based solely on science and public health. We call on the AAP to strengthen conflict-of-interest safeguards and keep its publications free from financial influence, ensuring every recommendation reflects only the best interests of America’s children. Instead, the AAP is undermining national immunization policymaking with baseless political attacks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The statement continues: “Secretary Kennedy has stood firm in his commitment to science, transparency, and restoring public trust. By bypassing the CDC’s advisory process and freelancing its own recommendations, while smearing those who demand accountability, the AAP is putting commercial interests ahead of public health and politics above America’s children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kennedy’s restructured vaccine panel has maintained support for annual flu shots but &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/26/rfk-flu-shot-vaccines-panel" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;voted to limit&lt;/a&gt; them to single-dose formulations without the preservative thimerosal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The AAP, however, maintains that the preservative &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-extensive-research-shows-thimerosal-is-safe/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;poses no risk&lt;/a&gt; and said physicians should administer any approved flu vaccine suitable for the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 19:48:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxQTUZ2eHRhSjJRaG1QZ3VZU3JKalZNcWZoZEF6OXh4aUdPREpOM3h4STJDcFFHMGh0ZnBtb3RjZ2FnbFpYMExSTm9LeEdaNXBwYjMtazNwc1hkYThISU5wOFphUWU2a2pzTUVSa2w3U1pVd1VOdlI2UlduLUdOTGJfZ3R0RExVaDQ1b2twU2JoS2J0SmNmcXN0cVI3bzIydnM</guid></item><item><title>从羊毛中提取的角蛋白突破性地修复牙齿- Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxOU0pHVnN5MU5aVnR0ellHZ3Zhd2JMay1BLTBJaU5taEZhbjBWaENyRzhGNTUtUUhpckFpN09SajNERlVwWU0zTU5wLXpreHVETDg4ekMwZzFkektqMjdpM1EzZk4xcFZUX0NtWDZrTFRkekJjdWJMMzB3WFlsM1JxelduRWc3MWc1TUFIYlBSRU9yS3RDWGJpZnJFaml1WWNY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p id="8d1a2f3f-63ef-4092-9cc9-69130d3f3599"&gt;Dental treatments from sheep’s wool and other hair could be used to coat teeth to repair enamel and prevent tooth decay, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After extracting keratin — a protein found in hair, skin and fingernails — from wool and applying it to teeth, scientists found that the substance formed a protective crystal-like coating that mimicked natural tooth enamel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="8d1a2f3f-63ef-4092-9cc9-69130d3f3599-2"&gt;The finding could support sustainable, low-cost treatments for early tooth decay within the next two to three years, according to the researchers.They reported their findings August 12 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202502465" target="_blank" data-url="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202502465" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Advanced Healthcare Materials&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="934397ad-c8ad-4e7d-92ec-58b3f48f4d6e"&gt;"Keratin offers a transformative alternative to current dental treatments," study coauthor&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/sara-gamea" target="_blank" data-url="https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/sara-gamea" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Sara Gamea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a dentistry researcher at King's College London, said in the statement. "Not only is it sustainably sourced from biological waste materials like hair and skin, it also eliminates the need for traditional plastic resins, commonly used in restorative dentistry, which are toxic and less durable. Keratin also looks much more natural than these treatments, as it can more closely match the color of the original tooth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Untreated tooth decay is the world's &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/oral-health" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/oral-health" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;most common oral health condition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, affecting some 2 billion people worldwide. Over time, acidic foods, poor oral hygiene, and everyday wear and tear can break down the protective enamel that covers a person's teeth. Losing that enamel can lead to pain, cavities and tooth loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unlike bones and hair, enamel does not regenerate," study coauthor&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/sherif-elsharkawy" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/sherif-elsharkawy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Sherif Elsharkawy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher specializing in prosthodontics at King's College London, said in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1094554" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1094554" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Then they mixed the keratin with water, where it formed a thin film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After applying the keratin film to a tooth sample, the scientists found that it formed an ordered, strong and crystal-like coating similar to biological enamel when it came in contact with minerals in saliva. Over the course of a month, the coating attracted calcium and phosphate ions, building up a hard, protective layer over the tooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="f2228bdb-e927-4ab7-ab51-b87250ac2faf"&gt;The scientists are exploring ways to bring the keratin treatment to the public. Keratin toothpastes for daily use or professional coatings applied at a dentist's office could be available within the next few years, according to the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are entering an exciting era where biotechnology allows us to not just treat symptoms but restore biological function using the body's own materials," Elsharkawy said. "With further development and the right industry partnerships, we may soon be growing stronger, healthier smiles from something as simple as a haircut."&lt;/p&gt;

            We all know that influenza is a common and serious viral infection, but it’s good to be reminded ahead of the upcoming flu season, which typically starts in October.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimiand000e3b6n6x338ked@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were an estimated 47 million to 82 million flu illnesses in the United States between October 2024 and May 2025, resulting in between 610,000 and 1.3 million hospitalizations, according to preliminary estimated ranges from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimiand000f3b6ne8vm7jbi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most fatalities occur in older individuals, but children can also die from the flu. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/children.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC estimates&lt;/a&gt; that flu-related deaths in children have generally ranged from 37 to 199 deaths each flu season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimiand000g3b6nf9s6y8ay@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, a new study in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2836871?guestAccessKey=cf976c38-c219-4f1e-968a-5728eafd28e6&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=073025&amp;amp;utm_source=BulletinHealthCare&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=073125&amp;amp;utm_content=NON-MEMBER&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article_alert-morning_rounds_daily&amp;amp;utm_uid=3402323&amp;amp;utm_effort=DAMR01" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA&lt;/a&gt; has examined a rare but severe complication that can occur in children who contract the flu. This complication, called acute necrotizing encephalopathy, or ANE, carries a mortality rate of 27%  despite intensive care and treatment, according to the new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimiand000h3b6n48962y7h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I wanted to learn more about complications associated with the flu, specifically about ANE, what researchers learned about children with ANE, and how can ANE be prevented. And what should parents and families know ahead of the next flu season?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimiand000i3b6nmvksvqp3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To help with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimb0gc00003b6nafep23lj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What are complications associated with the flu? Who is most at risk?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimj1b2000n3b6nftdr5rix@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Most people who have the flu will recover without complications. They may go through days or even weeks having fever, runny nose, headache and fatigue, but these symptoms generally resolve without long-term consequences.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimj1b3000o3b6n17zwjdsy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some people, though, experience &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/children.html" target="_blank"&gt;complications&lt;/a&gt; that could result in severe illness or even death. These complications include pneumonia, sinus and ear infections, brain and neurological conditions, and the worsening of existing medical problems such as heart and kidney disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimj1b3000p3b6n8pzucpdz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People at higher risk for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;flu complications&lt;/a&gt; include individuals 65 years and older, children younger than 2 and pregnant women. In addition, there are a variety of chronic medical conditions that increase risk, including chronic lung disease, diabetes, heart disease, liver disorders, kidney dysfunction and any condition that makes you immunocompromised.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            ﻿&lt;strong&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;ANE is a &lt;a href="https://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions/acute-necrotizing-encephalopathy#:~:text=Acute%20necrotizing%20encephalopathy%20(ANE)%20is,often%20influenza%20(the%20flu)." target="_blank"&gt;rare but very serious condition&lt;/a&gt; that occurs as a result of influenza infection. It causes inflammation and swelling in the brain, and it &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6636323/#:~:text=Acute%20necrotizing%20encephalopathy%20(ANE)%20of,noted%20on%20neuroimaging%20%5B4%5D." target="_blank"&gt;can lead to&lt;/a&gt; seizures, impaired consciousness, coma, long-term brain damage and death.

            It’s not known precisely how common this condition is or whether the incidence has been changing in recent years. It can also occur after other viral illnesses, but it has been most closely associated with influenza, and most often in children.

In total, they included 41 children with influenza-related ANE.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimj1b3000v3b6n2hpnxjqi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The median age of these children was 5, and about 3 out of 4   were previously healthy. Importantly, just 16% of those for whom vaccination history was available had received the flu vaccine that season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimj1b3000w3b6n4h3ejknl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All these patients became very ill, and all developed encephalopathy, or altered brain function. Sixty-eight percent had seizures. Most had abnormalities in their platelet count, liver enzymes and spinal fluid composition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimj1b3000x3b6n0povwkw5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most patients received a combination of therapies, including steroids and immunoglobulins. Out of 41 patients in the analysis, 11 died. The median period between symptom onset and death was just three days; most of the children who died had such severe brain swelling that the pressure forced the brain downward, crushing vital areas that control breathing and heart function. All but one of the children who died had not received the latest flu vaccine. Among the survivors included in the analysis, 63% had at least moderate disability.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The first takeaway for me is that ANE, while rare, is extremely serious, with high morbidity and mortality. It can be deadly within a short period of time, which means prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential. Second, most children with ANE were previously healthy. Third, while some vaccinated children also became ill, most of those with ANE and nearly all of those who died had not received the flu vaccine that season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;It is not known why most people who contract flu never develop ANE, but some do. It’s also not known whether there is anything that be done once someone contracts the flu to prevent ANE.
    &lt;/p&gt;

This JAMA study also suggests that vaccination reduces the likelihood of developing ANE and of dying from it. The article and an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2837136?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jama.2025.13003" target="_blank"&gt;accompanying editorial&lt;/a&gt; emphasize the importance of everyone being up-to-date with the flu vaccine.

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What else should parents and families know ahead of the next flu season?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Influenza is a common illness that can have serious complications, including in previously healthy individuals. Getting the flu vaccine is helpful both for reducing the chance of contracting the flu and for lowering the likelihood of developing complications. The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/2025-2026.html#:~:text=Everyone%206%20months%20and%20older,%2C%20pregnant%20women%2C%20and%20adults." target="_blank"&gt;recommends the flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt; for virtually everyone 6 months and older. Parents should be sure that their children receive the flu vaccine in the fall and that they and others in the family are vaccinated, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimj1b300143b6nx69k5l3y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Of course, flu is not the only contagious respiratory illness that can spread in fall and winter months. It’s important for people who have fever and active respiratory symptoms to stay away from others, especially those most vulnerable to severe illness. Good hand hygiene can lower the risk of spreading contagious diseases, as can taking precautions like masking in indoor crowded settings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Archaeologists at Magna Roman Fort have uncovered leather footwear that is unusually large for the period, in some cases longer than 12 inches, with one example measuring roughly 12.8 inches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scale of the discovery stands out in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-roman-concrete-offers-lessons-for-sustainable-building/"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; archaeology and raises fresh questions about who was wearing what on Hadrian’s Wall. The find is not a one-off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the season’s assemblage at Magna, about a quarter of the shoes exceed 11.8 inches, while a nearby site, Vindolanda, shows only a tiny fraction of supersized examples in its long-studied collection. That contrast invites careful comparison rather than quick conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uwo.ca/classics//about-us/greene.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr Elizabeth Greene&lt;/a&gt;, Associate Professor at &lt;a href="https://www.uwo.ca/arts/"&gt;West&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uwo.ca/arts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uwo.ca/arts/"&gt;rn University&lt;/a&gt; and the Vindolanda Trust’s footwear specialist, and &lt;a href="https://ajaonline.org/author/4743/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr Andrew Birley&lt;/a&gt;, CEO and Director of Excavations at the &lt;a href="https://romanarmymuseum.com/about-vindolanda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vindolanda Trust&lt;/a&gt;, are among the researchers interpreting the new material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-surprising-size-for-roman-shoes"&gt;Surprising size for Roman shoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/317-skeletons-from-the-roman-empire-found-beneath-an-old-shopping-center/"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; footwear usually mirrors modern feet more than myths suggest, which is why Magna’s outliers get attention. Eight shoes longer than 11.8 inches have been logged so far this season, including the current Trust record at about 12.8 inches, taken from a defensive ditch just outside the fort wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What explains the upsizing here but not next door at Vindolanda, where more than 5,000 Roman shoes have been cataloged over decades of work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hypothesis is a garrison or community with different body types or supply habits, but the data set is still small and under conservation, so restraint is wise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shoes are not just sizes and soles. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/archeologists-discover-sculptures-that-could-be-almost-life-size-representations-of-a-roman-family/"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; cobblers built layers of cowhide into sturdy platform shoes and pegged them with iron hobnails, so the outsole gripped and lasted on rough surfaces, which helps archaeologists read use, wear and gait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When leather survives with seams, thongs, and nail patterns, it can point to workshop traditions, supply routes, and even rank or role within a unit or household. Those are testable lines of inquiry at Magna as conservation advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clues-from-the-soil"&gt;Clues from the soil&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shoes survive because the ditch fills at Magna have been at least partly anaerobic, meaning oxygen was limited and decay slowed way down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low oxygen, high groundwater, and fine sediments together create &lt;a href="https://historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/preserving-archaeological-remains/heag100e-appendix4-water-monitoring-for-archaeological-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;preservation pockets&lt;/a&gt; where organic finds hang on for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those conditions also seal in fragile traces of daily life, like insect parts, seeds, and parasite eggs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team at Vindolanda, just a short walk east along the frontier, previously recovered roundworm and whipworm eggs from drain sediments linked to a latrine, which adds a health dimension to material culture studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-preserving-ancient-roman-shoes"&gt;Preserving ancient Roman shoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same chemistry that protects leather can be undone by drying soils, fluctuating water tables, and shifts in oxidation reduction potential (&lt;a href="https://www.gov.nt.ca/sites/ecc/files/oxidation-reduction_potential.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ORP&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Site monitoring on Hadrian’s Wall has documented the vulnerability of waterlogged archaeology to modern weather patterns, which is a polite way of saying that climate variability can accelerate loss of information in a single hot, dry season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Vindolanda, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94853-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;scientists&lt;/a&gt; have paired portable X-ray fluorescence with microbial DNA surveys to track how buried conditions shape preservation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That work provides a technical baseline for interpreting the state of organic artefacts and for planning how to stabilize deposits before they turn aerobic and start crumbling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can only celebrate and marvel at the diversity and differences of these people if we can still see them in the archaeological data we gather today,” said Birley, pointing to the bigger picture that sits behind a single large sole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-to-watch-as-analysis-continues"&gt;What to watch as analysis continues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservators expect modest shrinkage during treatment, so final measurements may tick down a hair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the current proportions already push the edges of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/nasas-roman-space-telescope-hopes-to-solve-the-dark-matter-mystery/"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; footwear known from Britain and justify careful comparison to the long-run dataset at Vindolanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wear patterns, nail layouts, and any surviving uppers will help distinguish winter boots from everyday shoes, and medical padding from sizing differences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Context matters, so associated pottery and construction phases inside the fort will anchor the footwear in time and use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-frontier-that-keeps-teaching"&gt;Frontier that keeps teaching&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hadrian’s Wall is famous for stone and turf, but its quieter story is the organic record below the grass. When that record holds together, it can show how soldiers and families shopped, worked, walked, and stayed warm, right down to what got tracked through a doorway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is why Magna’s ditch fills matter beyond a headline about big feet. They give archaeologists more than a snapshot, they give a sequence of choices across seasons and supplies that we cannot reconstruct from pottery alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-hygiene-and-the-small-stuff"&gt;Health, hygiene, and the small stuff&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists are also looking for tiny traces in the same layers, since these deposits can contain important health-related evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24141513/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Paleoparasitology&lt;/a&gt; integrates microscope work with site context to trace infections across time and place, and it already has a track record in Roman Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Vindolanda, the latrine drain eggs confirmed gastrointestinal infections that were widespread across the empire, a pattern echoed by independent &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/roman-toilets-gave-no-clear-health-benefit-and-romanisation-actually-spread-parasites" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; of Roman sanitation and parasite prevalence. That kind of evidence sits in the same micro-environments that keep leather intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simplest next step is the hardest: patient conservation, measurement, and context-by-context analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only then will the statistics settle enough to test whether Magna’s footwear points to taller people, different supply chains, or colder kit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the preservation question will not wait forever. Keeping ditch fills wet and low in oxygen is not just a technical preference, it is the condition that keeps this period’s most personal artefacts readable at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:42:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxQRkNXNDR4QktZTWswM082cFFLNVVWZ0RMU0xld3BkZXFMaUVRQlA5a1FXU2NySERndVM5QXBfbHZ5T0E0cHVpTFJjYnQwSWkxa1l5ZTAyNm52OWlwNHh6WGN4WXlMRDB4NC1yOGNFNkJLa3I5VU4waDNIUHAtSUlZWGdseDRHVGJxcGk0SklqVXJqcWR4WFF2Y3p5c211TWN1bzNwZzB5OFpPNmx3OTludQ</guid></item><item><title>索马里白喉病例螺旋上升，卫生官员警告-《卫报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQS3ZkYm1YR0N0QjhyVGlaZ084dndNMmNvUEsxTm43OFdqczFHVVA1S3dlZzJ5QVJ4bElfSUNGT2NSd0FtbFBLYVRvV0F5dEd1RWJqM2RBd0dGS1FEbzhEV2tPejdsZGt1RnJjM2FYTnFTQl9oQlJIMEpCQ1NhS3VpQkpYMlpxcUds?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Diphtheria cases are rapidly increasing across &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/somalia" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;, officials and humanitarians warn, with children accounting for more than 97% of the cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Diphtheria, a highly contagious and deadly bacterial disease that mainly affects children, is preventable by a vaccine.

We have received about 49 patients in the whole of 2024 but this year, 2025, we have received 497 diphtheria cases during the last four months alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Deaths had risen from 13 to 42, according to a report by Ahmed’s hospital this month. The report described the resurgence of diphtheria as “one of the most urgent and dangerous threats to public health”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Earlier this month, the health ministry said it had recorded 1,616 cases and 87 deaths from the disease so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;MSF’s Somalia medical coordinator, Frida Athanassiadis, said: “We are seeing a rapid increase in diphtheria among children under 15 in central Somalia,” adding that they accounted for roughly 97% of cases. “Low vaccination coverage, vaccine hesitancy and poor living conditions are driving the spread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Athanassiadis said that in some medical centres the basic resources were “insufficient to cope with rising caseloads”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;MSF said while teams initially had a small emergency stock of the antitoxin, it had now been exhausted, with the health ministry and the World Health Organization helping to distribute the “limited available stock based on needs”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In July, Save the Children warned that since April cases of measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, cholera and severe respiratory infections in Somalia had doubled from roughly 22,600 to more than 46,000. About 60% of the cases were children under five, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The sharp rise in vaccine-preventable diseases is linked to the recent aid cuts, which have impacted the health system’s capacity to deliver essential services, including routine immunisation, and to treat and run catch-up campaigns to increase the immunity necessary to halt the outbreak,” the NGO &lt;a href="https://www.savethechildren.org/us/about-us/media-and-news/2025-press-releases/infectious-diseases-in-somalia-double-in-3-months" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In Mogadishu, one resident, Abdiwahid Ali, said: “Many children in my neighbourhood are sick, some of them hospitalised.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Anab Hassan, a grocer, said people were concerned about the outbreak. “A friend of mine lost a five-year-old daughter who was diagnosed with diphtheria, and several others told me their children are sick and coughing,” she said. “We hear about children getting sick every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQS3ZkYm1YR0N0QjhyVGlaZ084dndNMmNvUEsxTm43OFdqczFHVVA1S3dlZzJ5QVJ4bElfSUNGT2NSd0FtbFBLYVRvV0F5dEd1RWJqM2RBd0dGS1FEbzhEV2tPejdsZGt1RnJjM2FYTnFTQl9oQlJIMEpCQ1NhS3VpQkpYMlpxcUds</guid></item><item><title>整个费城地区西尼罗河病毒感染率不断上升-费城6abc</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxPclNEOXQyRG1jYnNWY1ZpWl9WdVU5OHAzRTZWMklYT0pzRHJZWlpobVpzUkdieDkyY0pKTkJMWkNQOW5tX2ctTzlGcjhZUEZwVGZ0STdXR2c4WksxSTB5MkxCUFBhRkVNQ1NWMjR6TVpUNERqMTZ4T0oxNHh2enlLaDE4cUhGZHlRODZTSNIBkgFBVV95cUxNSXJVUy1VMnlzOF8wdjF0dXBYbzhzME5IUnRuSS1qYkF6YlM3eS1PSzVBWFEtOG5MaXVyaHMwVkJPbUQtdk9JZ2VxN0YzZU1PU0tLYlNRNG5VZGFleEpCcVl4cDNxbEExb1ktamdLT3BBdm5XcncwUHA1b21aMmxiWl80aEtSTXU1R2h3bXh4a2RFUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="theme-e FITT_Article_main__body oBTii mrzah " data-testid="prism-GridColumn"&gt;&lt;div class="dHdHP jLREf zXXje aGO eCClZ nTLv jLsYA gmuro TOSFd VmeZt sCkVm hkQai wGrlE MUuGM fciaN qQjt DhNVo Tgcqk IGLAf tWjkv "&gt;&lt;p class="kCTVx qtHut lqtkC HkWF HfYhe kGyAC " data-testid="prism-headline"&gt;&lt;h1 class="vMjAx eeTZd tntuS eHrJ "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Rates of West Nile Virus increasing throughout Philadelphia region&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="QHblV nkdHX mHUQ kvZxL hTosT whbOj " data-testid="prism-byline"&gt;&lt;div class="VZTD mLASH BQWr OcxMG oJce "&gt;&lt;div class="kKfXc ubAkB VZTD rEPuv "&gt;&lt;div class="VZTD mLASH gpiba "&gt;&lt;p class="jTKbV zIIsP ZdbeE xAPpq QtiLO JQYD "&gt;Tuesday, August 19, 2025 4:42PM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="LeadVideoWrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="ScrollSpy_container"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="VideoCaption nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU eEzcu lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Officials say West Nile Virus has been detected in mosquitoes in nearly every Pennsylvania county.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="XQpSH " data-testid="prism-divider"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;The rates of West Nile Virus are increasing throughout the Philadelphia region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This is placing people at significant risk for the mosquito-borne illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;No one has tested positive for West Nile in Pennsylvania this year.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="47" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy0zc00123b79n5u3ef2f@published"&gt;I recently started casually online dating after leaving an abusive marriage, and it’s been going great! There have been lots of nice guys, and we have had some sexy fun. That said, I’ve run into a weird situation that I’m almost certainly overthinking but am baffled by.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy11a00133b79nfn96917@published"&gt;I used to work in adult retail in my early 20s and am a very empathetic and sex positive person, all of which is information I share either before meeting or on the first date. I went on a first date last night with a great, interesting, funny guy that I got along very well with, who told me after dinner that he has a medical condition that causes incredibly painful erections and, because of this, has had difficulty with intercourse (and subsequently, online dating). Being the curious and empathetic person I am, I asked if he wanted to take me back to my place, and we had some really incredible foreplay.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy13700143b79ftv82enj@published"&gt;When his pants came off, I found that his penis was bent upwards in a U shape with his head pointing back towards his stomach. I saw a decent assortment of penises in my porn store days and am good at keeping my face neutral when I see something new at this point (with my apologies to the guy with the micropenis I slept with when I was 19), so I modified my usual blowjob routine to work with what I had and we were able to have relatively satisfying PIV intercourse, that he initiated. I have two questions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="201" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy15700153b793pq807gi@published"&gt;How can I balance wanting to make sure he’s not in pain and is enjoying things as we try stuff out with not completely killing the mood every time we switch to something new, especially since there isn’t a blanket answer to what will or won’t be painful on a given encounter? He has the type of personality where I’m concerned he might not vocalize that he’s in pain, so I don’t feel weird about the whole thing, but I don’t want to be causing him discomfort. My other question, and I feel bad for saying this, is… I love a good dick. So much. And after getting out of a bad marriage with bad sex, I was really looking forward to exploring the world of dicks for a while. I’ve been open with him about the fact that I’m just casually dating at this point, so I’m not especially concerned that I’m leading him on, but am I a total … dick if I come to realize that it’s a deal-breaker for me? And if it is, how do I say or not say that so that I don’t make this sweet man feel any more awkward about his condition?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="3" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy19900173b79g0g4bd1p@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Getting Bent,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy1bb00183b79anb32nxu@published"&gt;Talk to him about how, in general, you need to feel like your sexual partners will let you know if they’re in discomfort. Make it clear that this is something important to you, regardless of the individual’s body or any rare differences, but, you know, without emphasizing the latter excessively. Ask him whether he feels like he’s able to do that. If he’s unsure, find out what might be holding him back from doing so. If you still aren’t comfortable assuming he’ll say something in the moment, that’s a cue to move along.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy1da00193b79jljbdqo5@published"&gt;You almost certainly already have some awareness of his facial expressions, body language, and vocalizations during sex. During this initial phase, focus a little extra on understanding what he looks and sounds like when he’s having a good time, and when he’s experiencing discomfort, until you feel like you have a pretty good grasp of his individual lexicon. If you’re inclined to notice tactile cues, such as certain parts of his body developing tension, make note of those as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy1fg001a3b79tbx11m18@published"&gt;From there, it’s the same reliance on the twin pillars of “I trust this person to usually notice and speak up if they’re uncomfortable” and “I trust myself to usually notice if their signs of pleasure stop or signs of pain start” that we tend to have in sexual encounters. Even together, the two aren’t completely foolproof. But they are the best we can do without the ability to read minds.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy1i0001b3b79zkaaeu4g@published"&gt;As for whether it’s a dick move to decide that the sex isn’t working for you in a way that your partner can’t do anything about, broadly speaking, I’d say no. No more than it’s a dick move to decide you’re unwilling to relocate to a different city, live a significantly different type of lifestyle, or date people of genders outside your sexual orientation. What would be a dick move, though, is focusing entirely on people’s dicks as a metric of whether you’re interested in continuing to see them. I suspect that when you’re considering your dates, you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; factoring in many other features. So, as much as this man’s member is quite the outlier, keep an eye on the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy1k2001c3b792051ppil@published"&gt;If you do decide to end the relationship, remember that no matter how gentle you are, you can’t control how he reacts. There’s one possible world where you let him know that you’re no longer interested in seeing each other, and he’s relieved because he’s been trying to figure out a way to break things off with you. There’s another where you end the relationship over, say, political views, and he still makes it out to be a rejection over his dick. One thing you can do at this stage, while you’re waiting to find out what your feelings are toward him (and his anatomy), is resist any temptation to see him every other day or stay in constant contact—keep things as casual as you’ve told him they’re going to be.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="200" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioyvfg001p3b79cnpsqc16@published"&gt;As a 21-year-old woman who is a virgin, I know I’m late to sex. I’d ideally like to start having some—but be it because of my generation’s sex recession, my own shyness, or the complete absence of dating culture, the opportunity has never really presented itself. I never dated in high school (I wasn’t interested, and was too focused on getting into college to have a relationship), and by the time I got to college, I just kind of assumed it would happen on its own. But in truth, there isn’t much of a culture of hookups or dating at my college, as it’s very small and competitive. Everyone is pretty awkward all around. I’ve had a longer-term relationship with a guy before, but he was religious and wanted to wait until marriage, so nothing ever happened (we broke up for reasons unrelated to sex). Hinge led to a handful of OK first dates, and Tinder led to six cancellations and two honestly terrible in-person encounters. I’ve since deleted the apps to focus on school and just to get off my phone. At this point, I’m not even sure if I’m into men, or if I might lean more lesbian.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioyvfi001q3b7982ulrkgn@published"&gt;I felt like my college years were hyped up as a time of casual sex, exploration, and fun. I genuinely don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I’m decently attractive, funny, and have plenty of friends at school and work; in all other ways but this, I have my life together. My parents and relatives frequently question why I’m not in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioyvfi001r3b790ze6kzvp@published"&gt;Is there any way forward in this situation? I’m not looking for a long-term relationship right now, but should I try for one just to see where things go? Redownload the apps, or try a different platform? Or just surrender and accept that my virginity doesn’t really matter to anyone but me?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioyvfj001u3b7957lp7tzj@published"&gt;I’m guessing that part of your perception of college as a time of casual sex, exploration, and fun comes from the media you were exposed to growing up—be that social media or television and film. But both memes and movies tend to distort reality. A whole bunch of people in previous generations got through college and then found themselves feeling they’d missed out on a big bacchanal. Also, &lt;a href="https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/i-lived-through-peak-indie-sleaze-gen-z-need-to-stop-glamourising-it"&gt;a lot of Millennial hook-up culture took place in a context of large quantities of alcohol and substances&lt;/a&gt;, which has a way of removing inhibitions. Given the ways that inebriation clouds consent, it’s for the best that this former fad has faded.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioyvfj001v3b796ivzd88g@published"&gt;Another cultural institution that seems to be transforming is the dating app. Where 15 to 20 years ago, dating apps often felt like they were opening up a whole world of romantic and sexual partners we might be more likely to share interests and desires with, many people now describe them with a lot of frustration, often lamenting that they’re full of scammers and profiles that seem to be bots. Mostly, though, lots of people—including your peers, and maybe even some of your classmates—are having the same desire you describe of wanting to get off their devices.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="188" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioyvfj001w3b79xa7fmuh0@published"&gt;So get out there and meet people. Join a club, bring any schoolwork that can be done in a public space to a cafe or similar, and go out with friends. Do whatever you can to put yourself in situations where you might socialize. Keep an open mind about whether the people you’re meeting will fit in your life at all, and especially what form being in your life might take. Maybe you make some new friends, you find someone to hook up with, or you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; find someone you want to develop something longer-term and romantic with (and who wants the same with you). Yes, there will likely be some awkward moments. Those uncomfortable moments often decrease with experience and practice. Most of your cohort are probably in a similar position—they all went through the upheaval of COVID lockdowns in their high school years, too, and you’re all part of the same generation that is reportedly going through a “sex recession” (however &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/04/gen-z-generation-sex-abstience-puriteen-research-studies.html"&gt;actually accurate&lt;/a&gt; that is). Even if sparks aren’t flying, you can support each other through the experiences you’re having and longings you’re hoping to fulfill.&lt;/p&gt;

Build a support network that will hopefully help you through that, and you might meet someone whose desires align with yours along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiozc65002a3b79z9jj830a@published"&gt;My lovely wife and I (cis female and male, both 40 years old) have maintained very active and fulfilling sex for over a decade. Over the past several years, we’ve slowly incorporated various toys into our sex life to great success. Our most prized possessions are a few large dildos that have become part of our standard repertoire. My wife loves being stretched out, and I love pleasuring her with them. It’s a win-win, and we have a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiozc66002b3b79iakjoy2p@published"&gt;Over the past year or two, however, my wife has been getting sporadic UTIs and yeast infections, and they’ve always come on the heels of a session with the big boys. We always do our best to keep everything sanitized, and we always make sure that the toys are cleaned thoroughly with anti-bacterial soap after each use and stored separately in their own bags. The dildos are never used for anything other than vaginal insertion.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiozc67002c3b793ot8s0vd@published"&gt;A few months ago, we decided to start putting condoms over the dildos to prevent any infection. (We still maintain the old cleaning routine, too. That hasn’t changed.) Things were going great until our last session, when my wife got yet another yeast infection after an evening with her largest toy wrapped up in a condom. We are both feeling frustrated and stumped. We love playing with the toys but it’s crushing for me to see her in discomfort and pain the day after a fun evening. Is this just a normal risk of using large toys? Are there better precautions that we could be taking? Is there something we’re missing?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiozc67002e3b7900ypzlrg@published"&gt;It’s worth your wife making a trip to her gynecologist, explaining the situation, and asking for some extra testing to confirm that what she’s experiencing really is recurring UTIs and yeast infections. So many different factors can throw off a vaginal microbiome, and more than one can result in the kind of discharge that looks like a yeast infection or the symptoms that read as a UTI, but it could be &lt;a href="https://www.bannerhealth.com/healthcareblog/better-me/is-it-a-yeast-infection-or-something-else"&gt;something else entirely&lt;/a&gt;. She should call the office, explain the situation briefly, and ask when it is best to come in—sometimes the doctor needs to see the issue when it’s active, and sometimes they want certain tests run before the appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

Since both of you enjoy this practice, it might be that big toys need to be a special occasion activity and reserved for times when she’ll be able to recover in comfort afterward. The good news is that there’s a whole wild world of sexual practices outside of big toys, and a significant chance that you’ll be able to find something else you both love just as much to fold into your repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;

But one health gym-goer revealed she was drinking so much it nearly killed her (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a piece for &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/08/water-hydration-exercise-heat-hyponatremia.html"&gt;Slate&lt;/a&gt;, Cameron wrote on&lt;span&gt; top of her water consumption she would consume more liquid through her 'morning coffees, a soda here and there, food (water filled!)', and any other drinks she happened to have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The writer explained: 'Altogether, I was getting too much water. Way, way too much. And now I was in danger.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Mayo Clinic, women should drink about 11.5 cups of water per day (2.7 liters), while men should consume 15.5 cups (3.7 liters).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, if you're exercising in the heat, aim for four to eight ounces every 20 minutes, depending on the intensity of the workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cameron was drinking to keep hydrated but she wasn't replacing the sodium lost from her sweat through sodium-rich foods and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sports drinks packed with electrolytes are one of the most convenient options for athletes or those engaging in intense physical activity to keep their sodium levels in check. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Healthy sodium levels in the blood typically range from 135 to 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L) or millimoles per liter (mmol/L) and a level below this range is considered hyponatremia, or low sodium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cameron did not reveal what her reading was, just that it was below the healthy level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hyponatremia occurs when drinking too much water within a short time frame overwhelms the body's organs, namely the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Normally, the kidneys filter out extra water and waste, producing urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Thunder Jalili, a professor of nutrition and integrative physiology at the University of Utah, previously told the Wall Street Journal that a person's kidneys can typically filter out one liter of water every hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When you drink more than a liter of water an hour, that's when you run into the risk of potentially diluting your electrolytes,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;John Putnam (pictured), then 74, suffered heart attack-like symptoms after drinking too much water&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include sodium, which is vital for regulating the amount of fluid in the body, but having too little of it causes water to build up around the body's cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cells then swell, leading to nausea, vomiting, headaches, confusion, muscle weakness, dizziness, and restlessness. But in more severe cases, such as Putnam's, it can lead to heart attack-like symptoms such as chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cameron said her doctor's response was 'blunt' and she was told that if she didn't change her habits she would be 'risking far worse than a headache.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was told to drink no more than a liter of fluid daily for several days in order to bring her sodium levels back to a healthy baseline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a person used to drinking up to four liters a day, she found that cutting back was 'hard.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two years on from her initial diagnosis, Cameron wrote that she is better at monitoring her water intake but she is still not perfect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She concluded: 'Have I learned my lesson? Sort of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’ve been diagnosed with hyponatremia more than once since that first instance; my doctor thinks I’m one of those people that just run a little low on sodium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But I have made changes. I make a conscious effort to notice my thirst while exercising. When I know I’m going to be sweating a lot, I also take an electrolyte mix called LMNT, which I order online; it contains almost half of my daily recommended sodium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I also feel entirely at liberty with the table salt. It’s working for me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cameron's story comes about a year after Texas resident John Putnam, then 74, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13714529/texas-man-rushed-hospital-water-toxicity-heart-attack.html"&gt;suffered heart attack-like symptoms after drinking too much water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Putnam was working as a landscaper in June 2024 when the temperatures reached 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time he mowed his second lawn of the day, Putnam was so thirsty he had consumed almost three gallons of water within five hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he was overcome with nausea and fatigue, which turned into chest pain and trouble breathing by evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Putnam was rushed to the hospital for what he believed was a heart attack. Instead, doctors told him he had suffered water poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have suspected that water toxicity is on the rise due to an increase in heat waves across the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggests that the condition affects anywhere from 3million to 6million Americans every year, or at least one in 100 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hyponatremia can also be more common in older adults like Putnam. According to the Mayo Clinic, this is because older patients are more likely to take medications or suffer from conditions that lower their sodium levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases of hyponatremia, brain cells swell and lead to pressure inside the skull. Blood flow to the brain then becomes reduced, resulting in seizures, coma, and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment for hyponatremia depends on the severity of the condition. For mild cases, doctors may restrict fluids. However, more severe cases may require medications to manage low sodium levels or replacing sodium intravenously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A once-vanquished disease spread by mosquitoes may be making inroads into the United States. New Jersey officials are now investigating whether a resident’s malaria infection was locally acquired.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New Jersey Departments of Health (NJDOH) and Environmental Protection &lt;a href="https://www.nj.gov/health/news/2025/approved/20250818a.shtml"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on the case Monday. The resident hadn’t recently traveled, suggesting they likely caught it from homegrown mosquitoes. If so, this would be the first locally acquired malaria case seen in the state in over three decades, though not the first such case reported in the country this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The blood-loving parasite&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/index.html"&gt;Malaria&lt;/a&gt; is caused by several species of the single-celled parasite &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/em&gt;. When an infected mosquito transmits the disease to a person, the parasites will first invade certain tissues (usually the liver), reproduce, and then infect red blood cells. A small percentage of the parasites in the bloodstream will develop into a stage of life that can newly infect and grow inside mosquitoes that bite the person, starting the cycle all over again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The symptoms of malaria, which include fatigue, chills, and other flu-like illnesses, are caused by the damage the infection causes to our blood cells. Though most people survive their bout of malaria, it can also cause life-threatening complications like seizures, kidney failure, and sepsis. Even with available treatments today, malaria still &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria"&gt;kills&lt;/a&gt; roughly 600,000 people worldwide every year—making it one of the deadliest diseases around.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Malaria was once a common threat in the U.S., particularly in warmer areas during the summer. But a dedicated public health campaign, which included mosquito spraying programs and the removal of breeding sites, eradicated the disease by the 1950s. Since then, just about all malaria cases reported in the U.S. are travel-related, originating from places where the disease is endemic. But the potential for malaria to make a comeback remains.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A mosquito mystery&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Malaria is spread by the bite of a female &lt;em&gt;Anopheles&lt;/em&gt; mosquito, and there are native species in the U.S. that can transmit the disease to humans, including in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though officials are unsure about the origin of this latest case, it’s possible that a person with travel-related malaria arrived in the area and was bitten by a mosquito that may have then bitten someone else. According to health officials, roughly 100 travel-related cases are reported annually in the state. If this new case is confirmed as local, this would be the first homegrown case documented in New Jersey since 1991.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Officials say that malaria’s threat to the greater public is minimal, but other recent cases have been locally acquired. In 2023, for instance, there were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00496.html"&gt;three separate clusters&lt;/a&gt; in Florida, Texas, and Maryland (at the time, they were the first local U.S. cases documented in two decades). And earlier this month, Washington officials &lt;a href="https://tpchd.org/news/we-are-investigating-possible-locally-acquired-case-of-malaria/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; their own possible homegrown case of malaria, quite possibly the first ever found in the state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Low as people’s risk of malaria may be, we should still do our best to prevent mosquito bites. There are other diseases that mosquitoes in the U.S. can spread outside of malaria, including West Nile virus, Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), and even dengue fever. We can personally reduce bites by using insect repellent and wearing long-sleeved clothing. And people should also do their part to clean up areas around their homes that could turn into literal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I urge the public to continue taking steps to eliminate standing water around their properties, which will go a long way to reducing the risk of mosquito breeding,” said Shawn M.

The signals vary widely from person to person and from one moment to the next, which means no one should rush to treat a single breath reading as proof of recent use or impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/people/jennifer-berry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jennifer L. Berry&lt;/a&gt; is a research chemist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (&lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NIST&lt;/a&gt;). She worked alongside colleagues from the same institution and a partnering medical campus who contributed to the study’s design and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-thc-breath-tests-matter"&gt;Why THC breath tests matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have long wanted a simple roadside tool, but chemistry keeps getting in the way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THC and related &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11264354/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cannabinoids&lt;/a&gt; are large, sticky molecules that ride in airborne droplets rather than cleanly evaporating like alcohol, which complicates collection and measurement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is why teams now test both aerosol capture devices and exhaled breath condensate (&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2170898/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EBC&lt;/a&gt;) approaches that chill the breath to trap what comes out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with these methods, prior studies found THC hanging around before any observed use, a reminder that abstinence windows and device sensitivity can skew results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-study-learned"&gt;What the study learned&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study enrolled 29 adults, asked them to abstain ahead of time, and collected breath samples before consumption and again at about 47 minutes, 92 minutes, and 180 minutes after eating their own labeled edible product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two devices were used, one designed to catch aerosol particles and another that collects a cooled condensate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then analyzed each sample for THC and 10 other cannabinoids using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the abstinence requests, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/popular-new-thc-variant-delta-8-is-not-harmless-despite-marketing-claims/"&gt;THC&lt;/a&gt; appeared in pre-use breath from 27 of 29 participants, ranging from trace levels to more than 0.4 ng per device. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After edible ingestion, 19 participants showed a significant increase at one or more post-use time points, 4 showed no change, and 6 showed a significant decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This proof-of-concept study shows that THC concentration in breath can increase after the ingestion of cannabis-infused edibles, but the uncertainty of breath measurements and a longer time window need to be further explored,” wrote Berry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-thc-breath-tests-and-baseline-issues"&gt;THC breath tests and baseline issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The finding of detectable and/or quantifiable THC before cannabis use shows how challenging it is to interpret a single THC concentration measurement in breath with no prior information about THC at baseline,” wrote Berry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most striking pattern, beyond the individual variability, is the high rate of detectable THC before anyone ate an edible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That baseline problem is not unique to breath. A 2025 systematic &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12032524/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of studies connecting blood THC to driving performance found that most papers reported no linear relationship, even when driving metrics like lateral control and reaction time were measured with care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oral fluid tests are popular because they are easy to use, but their purpose matters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35640367/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of over 18,000 paired samples found that although THC in oral fluid can show whether THC is present in the blood, using it to identify drivers above standard blood limits would lead to many false positives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIST’s own breath work in cannabis smokers supports taking repeated measurements rather than a one-off reading, since THC often falls sharply within hours and device methods differ in what they capture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put simply, the new edible study adds a missing piece, but it does not turn breath into an instant yes or no test. It suggests that trends over time, not single snapshots, are more promising for identifying recent use across routes of administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means"&gt;What this means&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traffic safety policy has leaned on numerical cutoffs for alcohol for decades. Cannabis does not play by the same rules, and federal safety agencies have said as much in &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/documents/812440-marijuana-impaired-driving-report-to-congress.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; to Congress that caution against equating blood THC numbers with impairment in the way we do for alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have chronic users versus infrequent users, they have very different concentrations correlated to different effects,” said &lt;a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/library/podcast/whats-known-and-unknown-about-marijuana-part2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Frances Scott&lt;/a&gt;, a physical scientist at NIJ’s Office of Investigative and Forensic Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also tracked other cannabinoids. In many participants, CBN and CBG rose and fell in step with THC, while CBD sometimes did not, a hint that multi-analyte panels or ratios may carry more information than THC alone when the goal is to pinpoint recent use after edibles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern echoes earlier breath work showing some non-THC &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/trema-micrantha-brazilian-plant-contains-cbd-without-thc-found-in-cannabis/"&gt;cannabinoids&lt;/a&gt; appear only after use and could act as markers when combined with THC kinetics. It is a direction that calls for standard methods, shared reference materials, and longer sampling windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-for-thc-breath-tests"&gt;Next steps for THC breath tests&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a small, carefully designed study without standardized dosing, and participants brought their own edibles labeled &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cbd-relieves-anxiety-without-the-risks-that-come-with-thc/"&gt;THC&lt;/a&gt; that the researchers did not independently verify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sampling ended at 3 hours, which likely missed some peak values, and device differences could influence capture and recovery. None of the breath measures were tied directly to driving performance in this experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A credible breath test will require validated collection protocols, calibration standards, and clear guidance on how to interpret rising or falling readings over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those pieces are starting to come together in studies that map breath changes minute by minute and compare matrices side by side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the message is measured. Breath can carry THC after edibles, the kinetics can be tracked, and multi-timepoint strategies may be the fairest and most informative way to use that signal in real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jat/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jat/bkaf063/8196217" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Analytical Toxicology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 15:05:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxPU3hHNkxqQ25ZTEcxeDFWeC1LN0MyMDdRVzdoUnFmZjVNRmQ1YjJnMzNHdjRKU3hveWRRRGhhcXVOanBHbURlek45dDJtTE1JUDJKUzVFX1hJZldjNlpvN3dGSWRRcWdxOFJFMHNkNkFQNjJ1YnlsZGFPTENqVFh2dGt4aTFvaFBuNDNrdGQ2VHNFT1hfS2VVVDNveXhoc3U4MlZzRjdYQkJpb09KQWJHUHlEeEJJS3BFMDJKNg</guid></item><item><title>儿科小组无视RFK Jr. ，敦促为幼儿接种新冠疫苗-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxOOXEyM01hYkYxbnpORXB5ZWR3ZUZfQ1dua1hkRWQ5bFNjRTJncWJrNFNMMDgxR2JzazZkNFVYWlZqT09BV0p3NGhyUllwLVBRakhwOENkUWFYTm9Jel92U2QyR0lDWnljQ0NIaXdIVTl3ZWtnUWZHdWZSakdKU0xVQ2FPVmhycDBrMG5udFJqbEdXZlAtN1BWdW8zUUtJOGxI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="00Z81XJ9ND27QB44RV1KXVEWGG" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics on Tuesday&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;urged parents to get their youngest children vaccinated for covid, part of a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/06/24/vaccines-access-rfk-cdc/" target="_blank"&gt;broader effort&lt;/a&gt; by medical organizations to bypass Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

But then a patient’s neurons try to react to that, and fire up again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But stimulating neurons, Fregni said, seems to help regulate chronic pain by initially overactivating the neurons involved in pain processing, and then the neurons relax, bringing down the pain circuit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;His &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2835058" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2835058"&gt;recent study &lt;/a&gt;used electrical brain stimulation, along with exercise, and pain education for 112 women with fibromyalgia, and found the approach effective for helping to manage pain. The researchers taught the participants how to operate the brain stimulation device at home, and they were instructed to do this five times a week for four weeks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Fregni said the pain relief benefits started to decrease four weeks after the treatments ended.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Whatever is causing fibromyalgia, [brain stimulation] is not reaching the cause of whatever may lead to dysfunction in brain plasticity,” he said. The stimulation “is trying to balance the plasticity, trying to create an environment to better decrease pain, but whatever is causing it is still there.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;a href="https://med.uth.edu/psychiatry/2022/11/11/rodrigo-machado-vieira-md-phd-msc/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://med.uth.edu/psychiatry/2022/11/11/rodrigo-machado-vieira-md-phd-msc/"&gt;Dr. Rodrigo Machado-Vieira&lt;/a&gt;, a psychiatry professor at the McGovern Medical School at &lt;a href="https://www.uthouston.edu/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; UTHealth Houston&lt;/a&gt;, was lead researcher in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03305-y" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03305-y"&gt;study published last year&lt;/a&gt; involving 174 adults with moderate to severe depression.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;They were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: electrical brain stimulation, or inactive stimulation, which used the same device but did not provide a current. Participants were taught how to use the device at home and followed a 10-week course of treatment. Those who received the electrical stimulation showed significant improvements in the severity of their depression, compared to those who used the inactive device.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Machado-Vieira said some patients respond better to electrical versus magnetic stimulation, and vice-versa, but researchers still don’t understand why. One benefit of electrical rather than magnetic, however, is that the electrical devices being tested now are much smaller and lighter than the magnetic ones typically only used in doctors’ offices. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Machado-Vieira and other scientists said getting federal regulators to approve small electrical stimulation devices that can be used at home would make the treatment more widely accessible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“In terms of convenience for people who live far away, or who cannot travel to sessions at the clinic, that’s a clear advantage of the [electrical devices], but that doesn’t mean that they are going to respond better to that,” compared to magnetic stimulation, he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Machado-Vieira also said brain stimulation alone, without medications, is probably not powerful enough to treat major depression. But he understands as a clinician who has long treated patients, that some just won’t stick with their medications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt; “Psychiatric medications have some level of stigma,” he said. “There are some groups of patients who really are not willing to take antidepressants and would benefit from this [brain stimulation] type of intervention.”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

In 2019, there were over 9,000 cases, up from less than 1,000 cases reported each year in 2000. The spike has alarmed researchers and health officials since it appears that cases might continue to climb in the years to come as a result of climate change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What is Valley Fever? Here's what we know&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungus that causes Valley Fever, sometimes called coccidioidomycosis or “cocci,” develops in the soil in various areas of California and other southwestern states.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both humans and animals are susceptible to the Valley Fever, and it is transmitted via airborne spores that are inhaled into the lungs. It causes respiratory symptoms like fever, coughing, chest pain, and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/unsettled-cdc-shooter-patrick-joseph-white-was-armed-with-five-firearms-report-101754789178438.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="CDC"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;), it is frequently misdiagnosed or goes untreated due to its symptoms' resemblance to those of other respiratory illnesses, including pneumonia and even COVID. As a result, some patients may receive poor treatment or have delays in receiving the proper care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also Read:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/google-issues-red-alert-as-new-cyber-attack-targets-gmail-users-using-ai-with-indirect-prompt-injections-101755600288240.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Google issues red alert as new cyber attack targets Gmail users using AI with ‘indirect prompt injections’"&gt;Google issues red alert as new cyber attack targets Gmail users using AI with ‘indirect prompt injections’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some people may inhale the spores and not become unwell, while others are prone to acquire a more serious sickness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those who are particularly susceptible include pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems, people over 60, people with diabetes, and people who work in construction or other jobs where they are frequently exposed to dust and dirt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As per the CDC, 1 percent of individuals who contract Valley Fever may experience an infection that expands from their lungs to other parts of their body, including their skin, bones, joints, or brain, and 5 to 10 percent may experience severe or permanent lung difficulties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While many patients can recover on their own in a few weeks or months without therapy, some may need treatment, hospitalisation and antifungal medication for more severe infections.&lt;/p&gt;

Rather, it stemmed from investigators' conclusively linking an earlier death to the disease. The city said 108 people had been sickened, up from 101 reported on Friday, and 14 remained hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="eu1o8"&gt;The update follows word from the city last week that 12 water cooling towers in Central Harlem, scattered across 10 properties, had tested positive for Legionella, the bacterium that causes Legionnaires’ disease, a severe form of pneumonia. Legionella is spread by water droplets and vapors from contaminated water towers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7l1do"&gt;Several of the properties are connected with government operations, including Harlem Hospital, at 506 Lenox Ave., the city disclosed on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="2j6uh"&gt;Among the 10 locations, all but one had cooling towers that were either behind on required Legionella testing or had not been inspected by the city in the past year, according to a Gothamist analysis of city data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6ab7p"&gt;The city said Monday that all 12 towers had been remediated. The officials have not yet stated whether bacteria discovered at those towers had been linked to the ongoing infections. Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse said in a statement that the city was still awaiting the results of DNA sequencing. She said the fifth Legionnaires' death occurred "before mid-August."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="2g5bm"&gt;Jory Lange, a lawyer who said he represents 37 people who have contracted the disease in the current outbreak, called the death toll “shocking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="33mpq"&gt;“The building owners need to be held to account for this,” Lange said. “Legionnaires’ disease is completely preventable. None of this had to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="bna2j"&gt;City officials said last week that the outbreak was on the wane, though they expected new illnesses to be reported as people became aware of the outbreak and sought medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="810vh"&gt;The city passed a law in 2015 requiring all building owners to register their water cooling towers, and to put in place a maintenance plan to prevent and control the growth of Legionella and inspect and test cooling towers at least every three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="276f4"&gt;The regulatory changes came after the worst outbreak in city history that year sickened more than 130 people and caused 16 deaths. In the 2022 outbreak, five people also died. Each year, on average, hundreds of cases of Legionnaires’ disease are reported. Last year, 257 New Yorkers were diagnosed with the disease. In 2018, the number topped 650.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="36fh0"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This article was updated with additional information from the city.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 13:26:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPZGNDYTVEemE2SlV0TVVPVzFSMDVZaDFLRTk4akNkRTN3ZnQ1U2JucWxMRnNLcWpQVmpmRExSVmI4Mk5kMFNhRE92ZWpDQTV6YVh1bEJabE5zdUxvVmZFcXNEb2pJQVRpTlJzQ2hmMGdjM28yd3dhdV9uSVBNbDM3UnljUXdlU0Q1R0V0VFpWOGU</guid></item><item><title>剃须刀刀片COVID-19变体在新泽西州蔓延-补丁</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxNbk80OXV4QmltWnNnSGpweGhWdGd5S3hQYU90R2NmLWtmRWVodmZOZjl6TTJLSWtfb2k1QXhzNDJYZ1hMRE5POTgyVVRidzYtNFZLVkpDODdpbmZhQm4tZXV5dlZJTk1sdjYzV0xseWd4VmN1bWsycFVHX2xkOXdPdXJUZTZPbnhBZXhMMHBFS1o4V3o0Y2fSAaIBQVVfeXFMT293YzhIT0tDMktnaWtEdV80MDEybHVObTNsV2dHTk5WQmtGaUtoYVc5ak80cFllYmUxY0xucnNYYnJjZnRvZnJSZEZwQ1NzTF9jLVpuYW1keGRjT2RxY2NHQ0FhRlhaOG1POHNjM2lCejNvYmpDRjdqYUUwZUtkYlZzT0ExU1ZlTVItQThwMVNfOEdjWjBfQW4ySDd0ZVRvcE93?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://patch.com/us/across-america/new-covid-variant-stratus-distinctive-symptom-drives-cases"&gt;Stratus&lt;/a&gt; “razor blade” variant is driving up &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-modeling-and-forecasting/rt-estimates/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;COVID-19 cases&lt;/a&gt; in much of the country, and in New Jersey, case activity is growing, according to new government estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The XFG variant was first detected in January in Southeast Asia, and the earliest U.S. case was in March. In mid-June, XFG comprised 14 cases nationwide, but the NB.1.8.1, or “Nimbus” variant, remained the dominant strain. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s wastewater surveillance data, XFG is now the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-variants.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;dominant variant&lt;/a&gt; circulating in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency said COVID-19 cases are growing or likely to grow in 34 states and remain unchanged in 14.

Although &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine guidance is changing&lt;/a&gt;, the CDC website still says the COVID-19 vaccine helps protect against “severe illness, hospitalization and death.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 13:24:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNbk80OXV4QmltWnNnSGpweGhWdGd5S3hQYU90R2NmLWtmRWVodmZOZjl6TTJLSWtfb2k1QXhzNDJYZ1hMRE5POTgyVVRidzYtNFZLVkpDODdpbmZhQm4tZXV5dlZJTk1sdjYzV0xseWd4VmN1bWsycFVHX2xkOXdPdXJUZTZPbnhBZXhMMHBFS1o4V3o0Y2fSAaIBQVVfeXFMT293YzhIT0tDMktnaWtEdV80MDEybHVObTNsV2dHTk5WQmtGaUtoYVc5ak80cFllYmUxY0xucnNYYnJjZnRvZnJSZEZwQ1NzTF9jLVpuYW1keGRjT2RxY2NHQ0FhRlhaOG1POHNjM2lCejNvYmpDRjdqYUUwZUtkYlZzT0ExU1ZlTVItQThwMVNfOEdjWjBfQW4ySDd0ZVRvcE93</guid></item><item><title>大脑尸检揭示了阿尔茨海默氏症背后的潜在罪魁祸首- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxNbTdzdFJjenNjT2xkbHIxa0hMS0tZSGVPMmNkRjlmd21vOGE0WlFIM1d2eUktU1N0OERudXdqUEdTU0o2TXcxUThGM05nRmRMZFRoMHN4bmlDQXZTZkFMNmFJYzNIV1VtTFJFMDZmQkh3RXpxZnNaNUNGTjhWUWV2TUxweWF1UGhwM2swUkxiMVNGSmpSeVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Scientists have revealed that immune cells in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="166247" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; brains behave differently from those in brains of people without the disease – a discovery that could lead to new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in 2023, an analysis of human brain tissue discovered &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microglia"&gt;microglia&lt;/a&gt; in the brains of people with Alzheimer's were more frequently in a pre-inflammatory state, making them less likely to be protective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microglia are immune cells that help keep our brains healthy by clearing waste and preserving normal brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/radical-study-proposes-a-single-cause-to-explain-alzheimers-disease?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Radical Study Proposes a Single Cause to Explain Alzheimer's Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to infection or to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/for-the-first-time-scientists-capture-video-of-brains-clearing-out-dead-neurons"&gt;clear out dead cells&lt;/a&gt;, these nifty shape-shifters can become less spindly and more mobile to engulf invaders and rubbish.

This type of microglia has genes turned on that are involved in inflammation and cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the researchers found that microglia clusters in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease were more likely to be those in a pre-inflammatory state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means they were more likely to produce inflammatory molecules that can damage brain cells and possibly contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The microglia types in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease were less likely to be protective, compromising their ability to pull their weight in cleaning up dead cells and waste and promoting healthy brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_103339" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-103339" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/PhotomicrographOfMicrogliaInAD.jpg" alt="Photomicrograph of microglia from a brain affected by Alzheimer's disease." class="size-full wp-image-103339" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/PhotomicrographOfMicrogliaInAD.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/PhotomicrographOfMicrogliaInAD-589x415.jpg 589w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/PhotomicrographOfMicrogliaInAD-600x422.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-103339" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Photomicrograph of microglia (green) from a brain affected by Alzheimer's.

So we can't just look at a person's brain and say for sure what type of microglia they have; keeping track of how microglia change over time could help us understand how they contribute to Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At this point, we can't say whether the microglia are causing the pathology or whether the pathology is causing these microglia to alter their behavior," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/study-links-changes-in-brain-immune-cells-to-alzheimers"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Prater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-breakthrough-lithium-reverses-memory-loss-in-mice"&gt;Alzheimer's Breakthrough: Lithium Reverses Memory Loss in Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research advances our understanding of these cells' role in Alzheimer's disease and suggests certain microglia clusters may be targets for new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is hopeful that their work will lead to the development of new therapies that can improve the lives of people with Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now that we have determined the genetic profiles of these microglia, we can try to find out exactly what they are doing and hopefully identify ways to change their behaviors that may be contributing to Alzheimer's disease," Prater &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/study-links-changes-in-brain-immune-cells-to-alzheimers"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we can determine what they are doing, we might be able to change their behavior with treatments that might prevent or slow this disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-023-00424-y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in August 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In 1995, it synced its advice with recommendations made by the federal government’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a57dd6" class="body-graf"&gt;There have been a few small differences between AAP and CDC recommendations since then. For example, the AAP has advised that children get HPV vaccinations starting at age 9; the CDC says that’s OK but has emphasized vaccinations at ages 11 and 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0a45de" class="body-graf"&gt;But in 30 years, this is the first time the recommendations have differed “in a significant or substantial way,” Campbell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-ad5614"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1667" data-original-width="2500"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/250819-Centers-for-Disease-Control-and-Prevention-rs-af41d0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250819-Centers-for-Disease-Control-and-Prevention-rs-af41d0.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/250819-Centers-for-Disease-Control-and-Prevention-rs-af41d0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250819-Centers-for-Disease-Control-and-Prevention-rs-af41d0.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250819-Centers-for-Disease-Control-and-Prevention-rs-af41d0.jpg" alt="Large Scale Layoffs Begin At Center For Disease Control In Atlanta"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;People demonstrate outside the main campus of the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention on April 1 in Atlanta.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Elijah Nouvelage / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-995ecf" class="body-graf"&gt;Until recently, the CDC — following recommendations by infectious disease experts — has been urging annual Covid-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-06e8c3" class="body-graf"&gt;But in May, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-70c358cad726e57d680234c3ecdec926"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that Covid-19 vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women. A few days later, the CDC issued language that healthy children &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccines-cdc-kennedy-fd6ab0c7303a4a1698b319885a02ef54"&gt;may&lt;/a&gt; get the shots, but that there was no longer a “should” recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-18042f" class="body-graf"&gt;The idea that healthy older kids may be able to skip Covid-19 boosters has been brewing for some time among public health experts. As the pandemic has waned, experts have increasingly discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older — who are among those most as risk for death and hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ad24e6" class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-cdc-acip-kennedy-d9777cba947f5f52705af04d95e5f7fa"&gt;CDC expert panel&lt;/a&gt; in June was set to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among the options the panel was considering was whether suggest shots for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5240b" class="body-graf"&gt;But Kennedy bypassed the group, and also decided to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-cdc-acip-vaccines-3790c89f45b6314c5c7b686db0e3a8f9"&gt;dismiss&lt;/a&gt; the 17-member panel and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76"&gt;appoint&lt;/a&gt; his own, smaller panel, that included vaccine skeptics. Kennedy also later &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccine-committee-cdc-cfbdcab84b2a919a6131d471959c3431"&gt;excluded&lt;/a&gt; the AAP, the American Medical Association and other top medical organizations from working with the advisers to establish vaccination recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b27954" class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy’s new vaccine panel has yet to vote on Covid-19 shot recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd7837" class="body-graf"&gt;The panel did endorse continuing to recommend fall flu vaccinations, but also made a decision that led to another notable difference with the AAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-41a4e0" class="body-graf"&gt;The new advisory panel &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-flu-vaccine-thimerosal-c5696bbc19f345323153d5336cb5e798"&gt;voted&lt;/a&gt; that people should only get flu vaccines that are packaged as single doses and do not contain the preservative &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/thimerosal-mercury-vaccine-preservative-7626ec1455ad98228cf8b041f6388bab"&gt;thimerosal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8dcbab" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The AAP said there is no evidence of harm from the preservative, and recommended doctors use any licensed flu vaccine product that’s appropriate for the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 12:45:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxPcWJQU3hZMmRNejI3dGRHOVVMNG5DdEJ0UHNWbTBZNmRSYi1PeDJGODl0WEk1WDhYVUliRFV1RHZEclZFS3cxQlZiaHJGN2dSaWFWNElmYjJSZllFUE41RENtWGJlYWJWT2JFUmdzR0pJazBlY0VDd0ZjZjRpcnR6eFFTSFVxTGFyX3ZyWVZQUUVYNWxSZlRYMXZOajZuSTA1Zk9vc0RlYUcwYXZ6dk16T3RxSHpWcTl4QWZjZG8xQdIBVkFVX3lxTFBsVFNkelRjZ0dTWlRJZk9RTHpkajdXVWx3WmhPN2JRVHN1YkhvdW82YUZzUGlyWVYyN2U1RElTV0RPR1RLcGdvemY5U2huSGtIVlBCc1lR</guid></item><item><title>婴儿受益于诊所中的个性化基因编辑-自然</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX0FVX3lxTFB4c21UblBKOGxZbFpPYnN6SjU4SGtlbHJmYlI3c080R3RBckw5MGdIN1hzVTdlQlN0OEMzSHdFYUJUVmNIVVhPN1ZyRVVzZzc2OGpXN21RdGZtTnlkMTYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol class="c-article-references" data-track-component="outbound reference" data-track-context="references section"&gt;&lt;li class="c-article-references__item js-c-reading-companion-references-item" data-counter="1."&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-references__text" id="ref-CR1"&gt;Musunuru, K. &lt;i&gt;et al.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;N.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking to improve your heart health and lower your cholesterol levels, there’s one habit that should be at the top of your list—adding more fiber to your diet. Not only is fiber essential for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;digestive health&lt;/a&gt;, but it also plays an important role in lowering cholesterol, reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and supporting your overall well-being. The trouble is, most of us aren’t getting enough. In the U.S., only about 5% of men and 9% of women meet their daily needs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In this article, we’ll explore the many benefits of fiber, how it &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fiber-underrated-nutrient-for-heart-health-11788119" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;helps to lower cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, and practical tips to incorporate more of it into your meals. Plus, we asked dietitians to weigh in with their expert advice and top recommendations.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber can have a powerful impact on cholesterol levels, especially in the way it interacts with the digestive system. The two types of fiber, soluble and insoluble, play a key role in supporting heart health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Binds to Cholesterol and Removes It from the Body &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to&lt;a href="https://www.theleangreenbean.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Lindsay Livingston, RD&lt;/a&gt;, consuming &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;more soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, in the form of foods like oats, beans, lentils, vegetables and fruits like apples and bananas, can help lower cholesterol. “The soluble fiber binds with the cholesterol in your digestive tract, preventing it from being absorbed into your bloodstream,” says Livingston. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This process helps to lower LDL cholesterol, often referred to as “bad” cholesterol, which is a key contributor to plaque buildup in the arteries. In fact, studies found that a higher intake of soluble fiber significantly reduced &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-that-lower-cholesterol-11784141" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; in adults, confirming that even moderate increases in daily fiber intake can support cardiovascular health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Improves Gut Health and Supports Cholesterol Regulation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The gut microbiome, which consists of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-time-to-take-probiotics-supplements-11754743" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;trillions of bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, plays an important role in the breakdown of cholesterol. A diet rich in fiber promotes a healthy balance of gut bacteria, which can help regulate cholesterol levels.&lt;a href="https://wholesomenutritionco.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The bacteria then produce short-chain fatty acids, which help reduce cholesterol production in the liver, promoting proper fat digestion and absorption.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; By fostering a healthy gut microbiome, fiber supports overall metabolic health, which is essential for managing cholesterol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Reduces Inflammation and Helps Prevent Cholesterol Buildup &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chronic inflammation is one of the main causes of cardiovascular disease, and it can also lead to elevated cholesterol levels. Eating &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2057241/top-high-fiber-foods-you-need-in-your-life/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, can help to fight inflammation, reducing the risk of plaque buildup in the arteries.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research shows that the polyphenols found in those fiber-rich plant foods have anti-inflammatory effects that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-fight-inflammation-11762781" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;help reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; By managing inflammation, fiber helps prevent the buildup of cholesterol, reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis and heart disease.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While dietitians love fiber for lowering cholesterol, there are other diet and lifestyle changes that can also support heart health:

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Incorporate more healthy fats.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutritionwithjuliana.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Juliana Crimi, RD, M.H.Sc.&lt;/a&gt;, suggests choosing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fat-for-heart-health-8644218" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthy unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt; found in foods such as olive oil, nuts, seeds and avocados, and limiting saturated and trans fats to help improve cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Exercise regularly.&lt;/strong&gt; According to&lt;a href="https://bettrfull.com/about.html" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Nicole Randazzo, M.A., RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, exercise raises HDL (“good”) cholesterol, which helps clear LDL from the bloodstream.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Limit added sugars.&lt;/strong&gt; Holzum recommends reducing the amount of sugar and processed carbohydrates in your diet.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Women should aim for 25 grams of fiber daily, and men should get 38 grams of fiber per day. Incorporating more fiber into your diet doesn’t have to be hard. To avoid digestive discomfort, try &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11775341" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;increasing your fiber intake&lt;/a&gt; gradually, and drink plenty of water to help fiber move through your digestive system smoothly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are some practical tips for adding more fiber to your meals:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Start the day with fiber.&lt;/strong&gt; Begin your morning with a fiber-rich breakfast, such as oatmeal topped with fruit, chia seeds and a handful of nuts, or a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-fiber-chia-seed-smoothies-11790592" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-fiber smoothie&lt;/a&gt; made with leafy greens, berries and flaxseed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Choose whole grains.&lt;/strong&gt; Choose whole grains like quinoa, brown rice and whole-wheat bread instead of refined grains. These foods contain more fiber and are beneficial for lowering cholesterol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Snack on fiber-rich foods.&lt;/strong&gt; Choose snacks like raw vegetables paired with hummus, apples with a serving of almond butter, or a handful of nuts to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/anti-inflammatory-high-fiber-snack-recipes-11786267" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;increase your fiber intake&lt;/a&gt; throughout the day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Add in beans and legumes:&lt;/strong&gt; Include beans, lentils, chickpeas and other legumes in your favorite soups, stews and casserole.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Eating more fiber is one of the best ways to lower your cholesterol,” says&lt;a href="https://cravingsomethinghealthy.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Anne Danahy, M.S., RDN.&lt;/a&gt; It’s a simple, sustainable change that can provide immediate and long-term heart-health benefits. While increasing fiber is a powerful step, combining it with other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/heart-healthy-habits-for-summer-11766478" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;heart-healthy habits&lt;/a&gt;, such as regular physical activity, limiting saturated and trans fats, and maintaining a balanced diet, can enhance your results. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To make fiber a lasting habit, start by gradually adding it to meals and snacks, experimenting with different fiber-rich foods, and pairing them with foods you already enjoy. Over time, these small, consistent changes can become second nature, helping you protect your heart and improve your overall diet quality.&lt;br&gt;

            “It differs from recent recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the CDC, which was overhauled this year and replaced with individuals who have a history of spreading vaccine misinformation,” the AAP said in a news release.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The AAP recommendations are more explicit. It says that all children ages 6 through 23 months should receive a Covid-19 vaccine unless they have known allergies to the vaccine or its ingredients. It also recommends a single dose of the vaccine for children ages 2 through 18 years if they are at high risk of Covid-19, residents of long-term care facilities, have never been vaccinated against Covid-19, or live in a household with people who are high risk for Covid-19. It also says that the vaccine should be available for this age group even if they are in these risk groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Despite these recommendations, access to the vaccine may be difficult in the fall.

            “The AAP will continue to provide recommendations for immunizations that are rooted in science and are in the best interest of the health of infants, children and adolescents,” AAP President Dr. Susan J. Kressly in the said in the news release. “Pediatricians know how important routine childhood immunizations are in keeping children, families and their communities healthy and thriving.”

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A multi-institution team across Canada and the West Indies reports that gaze patterns can serve as a sensitive marker of cognitive decline, with associated reductions in explorative, adaptive, and differentiated visual sampling of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Eye movements are closely linked to encoding and retrieval processes, with changes in viewing behavior often reflecting age and pathology-related memory declines. Previous work has noted that groups differing in memory status diverge across multiple gaze features, suggesting that univariate gaze metrics may not fully capture the complexity of memory-related viewing behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Decoding &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/memory+function/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;memory function&lt;/a&gt; through naturalistic gaze patterns," &lt;a href="https://pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2505879122" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;PNAS&lt;/i&gt;, researchers investigated changes in naturalistic viewing behavior across five participant groups to explore possible gaze-based indicators of memory function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two experiments included young adults (Exp 1: n = 35, Exp 2: n = 26), healthy older adults (Exp 1: n = 36, Exp 2: n = 28), individuals at risk for significant cognitive decline based on a below threshold score (&amp;lt; 26) on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Exp 1: n = 12, Exp 2: n = 10), individuals diagnosed with MCI (Exp 1: n = 15, Exp 2: n = 11), and individuals diagnosed with amnesia (Exp 1: n = 4, Exp 2: n = 3). Eye movements were tracked using an Eyelink II head-mounted eyetracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiment 1 involved viewing 120 images (10 images from each of 12 categories) for 5 seconds each across three blocks, with 40 novel images per block. Idiosyncratic gaze similarity was computed as the average correlation of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/eye+movements/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;eye movements&lt;/a&gt; for every image with every other image within the same block by the same participant using the eyesim package.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Idiosyncratic gaze similarity increased across groups ordered by presumed memory function, with lowest similarity in younger adults and highest in amnesia, and model comparison favored the monotonic specification. Fixation count rose across groups yet did not reach a reliable effect. Fixation dispersion decreased across groups, indicating reduced explorative viewing with decreasing memory function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiment 2 involved three blocks with 120 images per block, 60 presented once and 60 repeated across blocks with 5 second viewing. Analysis focused on repeated images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repetitive gaze similarity increased across groups with presumed decreases in memory function, and model comparison slightly favored the linear specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthy young adults encoded unique image features with each presentation, building up a more comprehensive representation of each image in memory. Participants with decreased memory and/or hippocampal/medial temporal lobe function tended to view the same image features with each presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even without explicit task demands, gaze patterns varied systematically by group. Findings suggest that suboptimal encoding patterns may underlie the formation of impoverished memory representations in individuals with memory impairment and lay a foundation for future work using multivariate gaze metrics to diagnose and track memory and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results provide compelling evidence that naturalistic &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gaze/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gaze&lt;/a&gt; patterns can serve as a sensitive marker of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;

These supplements promised to do everything from reducing wrinkles, to maintaining focus, to keeping your gut biome intact. But how much of that is true?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;According to Anahad O’Conner, health columnist at the Washington Post, supplements can be a mixed bag. But despite the dubious evidence behind some of them, a lot of us are taking these pills and potions. “The best statistics we have show that at least 60 percent of people in the United States alone use dietary supplements,” he said. “And that’s just one supplement or more. I know one doctor who had told a story of a patient who was taking 121 supplements in a day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;How do we navigate the dizzying world of supplements? And what actually works as advertised? Below is an excerpt of our conversation with O’Connor, edited for length and clarity.

And scientists will say, “Okaym we need to figure out what doses we should be telling people to take and how often to take these supplements.” They’ve then found people who take these supplements actually develop side effects and are more likely to develop cancer or heart disease, prostate cancer, things like that, and have been shocked. In fact, what we know is that it’s the dose that makes the poison. We need some level of vitamins and nutrients, of course, but taking more and more and more is often not good for your health and can cause a lot of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, why are we allowed to take them? How come the FDA isn’t stepping in? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;To put it mildly, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2015/11/16/experts-debate-do-we-need-tougher-regulation-of-dietary-supplements/"&gt;dietary supplements are very loosely regulated&lt;/a&gt; in this country. They’re treated almost like they’re just food, because they are nutrients that come from food, but then they’re purified and concentrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Decades ago, the supplement industry pushed for this law called the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, which basically created what many critics call the Wild West of the supplement industry. Supplement makers can make all sorts of health claims. They can say that their supplement or their vitamin supports immune health, cardiovascular health, skin health — all these sorts of vague claims. They don’t have to undergo clinical trials where they’re tested to find out what doses are safe, what the side effects are, if they actually work or not for what’s claimed. And the FDA really can’t do anything once they’re on the market, unless there are reports of severe side effects. Right now, there are an estimated 90,000 different dietary supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;The FDA has no idea what most of the products are unless there are many reports of people getting sick from a particular supplement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These companies don’t have to register their products at all with the FDA. The FDA has no idea what most of the products are unless there are many reports of people getting sick from a particular supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And, in fact, you and I can easily create our own supplement company in five minutes. You can just create a website, get some powder, put it in a capsule, and start marketing your supplement. You don’t have to do any studies or notify any agency. You can just start marketing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think we should talk about a few of these supplements. Should we be taking those daily multivitamins? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you are eating a healthy diet, then it’s very unlikely that you actually need a multivitamin. Although there have been some studies showing benefits. For example, in older adults, it’s been shown that taking a daily multivitamin could potentially help with memory loss, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another thing everyone talks about is gut health. People say it can impact more than just your stomach. Should we be taking probiotics? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Probiotics are basically any bacteria or microbe that confers health benefits. You want a diverse community of gut microbes. You want a healthy ecosystem. But if you take a probiotic in capsule or pill form, what happens is that oftentimes they contain a limited number of species of bacteria in very concentrated mega-doses that can throw off the balance of your gut microbial ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Probiotics are good for you, and you can get them from fermented foods. So, you think about things like sauerkraut, kimchi, Greek yogurt, for example. Humans have been consuming fermented foods for thousands of years, and they contain these healthy live microbes. If you’re just taking the probiotics in capsule or pill form, there can be side effects, and you can actually reduce the diversity of your gut microbiome rather than enhance it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have a couple of more supplements to ask you about. One is collagen. I admit that I bought some back when my favorite influencer at the time was putting it in her macha lattes, and now it’s sitting there gathering dust on my coffee bar. Should we be taking it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;No, I don’t think so. I haven’t seen any convincing studies that show any benefits of taking collagen supplements. That is something that I would not particularly waste money on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;Unless you have a documented, demonstrated deficiency, you should be focusing on getting your nutrients and vitamins from your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about creatine? Who should be taking this beyond your gym bros who are trying to get buff? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Creatine has been around for a while, and there have been a lot of studies on its benefits. It’s something that you can obtain naturally from food, particularly meat. And there have been studies showing that when you take a creatine supplement in combination with resistance training, then you can get some benefits from that. Particularly, it’ll help you grow bigger and stronger, but the benefits are not extraordinary. It might help you gain a few extra reps out of your bench press or your squat, for example. What they have also shown is that if you’re just taking creatine and not lifting weights, then you’re not going to see any benefits from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s been a lot of health claims that it can improve your cognitive health, help with dementia. There haven’t been any real good studies demonstrating that. That’s not to say that it’s not true, just that it hasn’t really been shown conclusively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any final thoughts on supplements? Should we be as invested in them as we are? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I am not anti-supplement. I still take some supplements here and there. Protein powder, for example, is something I’ll add to my smoothies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Just be cognizant that there is a multibillion-dollar industry that wants the profit off of you by selling you their products, and they’re allowed to make all sorts of health claims and there are a lot of potential side effects. I always tell people, unless you have a documented demonstrated deficiency, you should be focusing on getting your nutrients and vitamins from your diet just by eating a lot of healthy whole foods, which is what human beings have been doing for millennia and has always worked. If you’re going to take supplements, be really careful about which ones you’re taking, make sure that you actually need it, that you’re actually getting benefits, and don’t just believe what the industry wants you to believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPOVJ5RDM2S1BHbjNqZzVyTHVLX1dhYzF6TEZGeFJ6T29JdnAxR0QwTkgtdmVjdDFWUE1GOTRBdzJxNGVnVXk1dEhLUndzdU1jLXlmYUU0MnhTMWktSHg0SVFmMUFtUTdZMjZDZGRzRUR2bGdlaTVac2Y1WnNPejZZbEJ3d0xxSHFMZ3Y1SWFzeWppTWxGOUE</guid></item><item><title>我们是整形外科医生—我们永远不会忽视这7个危险信号- HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNQnhLaFMtVEJJdDlDc2NjaWJod1FfSUY5U09SdFFjc3FkdUl0a243Ulg5SWNYYjFNbEVsZXhaOV9rMDA3MlA1SDN1M1NoUzdTUXFxUUloQk92MkF4UkpHTjk4cWU3OWEtSHhaV2tQVVVqc0dHS05PVl9STV85LVFBVDdGN25TaUpZdDBHOTZxSXZGZEV5cGlKNzY2SFHSAaIBQVVfeXFMUDFoZXdKbUVkS004UXpiVGVSTjZjWG03akVuUmgxV3JyOERHMlJ2elc1U3Z6V1NUVndrdGd6eW5uVS1zelJpd2N4UXo0Tk5USm5kWnUwTlRucXJkQWp3MHpIQ1NLSmg2d3YxQUJUQk1NOEx2QjlZM2JHVGhpVkowblNPb3NNRUczaHVfZHZtSDZZcExDVm8wR3JRT01KVlFlRUd3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When considering plastic surgery, selecting the right doctor is just as important as choosing the procedure itself.

Your surgeon is not board-certified in plastic surgery.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s essential to confirm that a surgeon is board-certified — and not just in any specialty, but specifically in plastic surgery. “This credential affirms they have completed rigorous training and examinations,” explained Murphy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, some doctors may market themselves as plastic surgeons without holding the proper certification. “This happens more commonly than you think and is not illegal, though it is unethical,” said Gould. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Hesh Hipp via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Hesh Hipp via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;A "cosmetic surgeon" isn't the same as being a board-certified plastic surgeon.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the doctor’s residency was in a non-plastic-surgery field like pediatrics, colorectal surgery, or even dermatology, “there’s a problem,” said Gould, who pointed out that the term “cosmetic surgeon” is often used in these cases, and although it sounds legitimate, it’s not the same as being a board-certified plastic surgeon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Your surgeon should be held to the standards of a board such as the American Board of Plastic Surgery or American Board of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, to ensure your safety and outcome,” said Sturm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Your surgeon doesn’t specialize in the procedure you want.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sturm advises patients to choose someone who specializes in the specific surgery they’re considering. This usually means the surgeon has performed the procedure more frequently, pursued deeper training, and kept up with relevant advancements. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There are so many great surgeons, but just because they are amazing at one procedure doesn’t mean they will be at all of them,” she noted. Pursuing a specialist means you’re more likely to see consistent results and benefit from a provider who knows how to handle complications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When selecting a plastic surgeon, “always inquire about their experience with the specific procedure you’re considering,” advised Murphy. Furthermore, you’ll want to “verify that your surgery will take place in an accredited facility, and make sure that pre-operative clearance is required.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. They don’t have lots of before-and-after photos to show you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before-and-after photos can provide valuable insight into a surgeon’s skills, aesthetic style, and the kind of results you can reasonably expect. “Ask how many similar surgeries they have performed and request before-and-after photos of their work,” suggested Murphy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If they have pages and pages of breast augmentations, but not many rhinoplasties, they may be a great surgeon, but more than likely don’t do as many rhinoplasties,” noted Sturm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still, Murphy cautioned patients to have realistic expectations. “A competent surgeon will not promise you perfection, as it simply isn’t achievable,” he said. “A qualified surgeon will provide feedback and input to make sure your expectations are achievable.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. The price is unusually low.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Be cautious of prices that seem too enticing,” warned Murphy, as this may indicate cut corners and come with hidden risks. “Many patients have come to me for revisions after being unhappy with low-cost procedures that didn’t turn out well.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. You feel any pressure to proceed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trust your instincts. If you feel pressured or manipulated, “this is a psychological form of gaslighting that has no place in medicine and certainly not in plastic surgery,” said Gould. “If your surgeon tries to scare you into a procedure, saying that if you go elsewhere, you will be butchered or that it will cost you dearly, this is another red flag.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If you ever feel uneasy about a situation, it’s perfectly acceptable to graciously excuse yourself,” said Murphy. “It’s critical to feel at ease before undergoing any procedure.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If at any time — even in the operating room right before the procedure — you feel like it’s wrong, it is always OK to say ‘stop,’” added Gould. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. There’s no wait time to schedule the surgery.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Availability can be another indicator of quality. “If your surgeon can do the surgery tomorrow, that’s not a good sign,” noted Gould. “Most skilled surgeons are booked out at least three months in advance, and there is a standardized process to lead up to the surgery, including adequate time for medical clearance, life planning, aftercare and travel. If your surgeon isn’t busy and booked, then that’s a red flag.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. They actively upsell you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When a consultation starts to feel more like a sales pitch, it’s a sign the surgeon may not be acting in your best interest. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When you go to a plastic surgeon, you are coming to address things about yourself that may make you self-conscious. You want to find a surgeon who helps you address those and feel more confident, not find more things to worry about,” explained Sturm, who noted that many of her revision patients were sold into procedures they didn’t originally seek. “They weren’t that worried about that area of their face in the first place but [were] talked into surgery.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the consultation feels off in any way, “I would politely complete the consultation and continue my search for the right plastic surgeon,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 11:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNQnhLaFMtVEJJdDlDc2NjaWJod1FfSUY5U09SdFFjc3FkdUl0a243Ulg5SWNYYjFNbEVsZXhaOV9rMDA3MlA1SDN1M1NoUzdTUXFxUUloQk92MkF4UkpHTjk4cWU3OWEtSHhaV2tQVVVqc0dHS05PVl9STV85LVFBVDdGN25TaUpZdDBHOTZxSXZGZEV5cGlKNzY2SFHSAaIBQVVfeXFMUDFoZXdKbUVkS004UXpiVGVSTjZjWG03akVuUmgxV3JyOERHMlJ2elc1U3Z6V1NUVndrdGd6eW5uVS1zelJpd2N4UXo0Tk5USm5kWnUwTlRucXJkQWp3MHpIQ1NLSmg2d3YxQUJUQk1NOEx2QjlZM2JHVGhpVkowblNPb3NNRUczaHVfZHZtSDZZcExDVm8wR3JRT01KVlFlRUd3</guid></item><item><title>这种意想不到的饮料可能会无声地削弱您的免疫系统-芝加哥Audible</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQWUY5cFg1UDBwLWZTbDhFdGNFUXJCQ2w3NkgwZHZ6ZVVkVGpqYjFycHpXN1Z5QUFwMGtBWGJGYjhvQ2hnNlRycFlvNHh0QmZ0eDJ1T2V5NVJXZXVNaC1GZ0puTzhOeS1UUDNGWWdWT2lnNlhTLUVva2RQSTRfdjZzdzZOd1liVDQxRXVWbVQzcXZsOFAz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;As winter wraps its chilly arms around us, many of us instinctively reach for our woolly scarves, vitamin C tablets, and that ever-comforting glass of mulled wine by the fire. It’s the season of boosting immunity, dodging cold viruses, and doing our best not to catch whatever bug the kids brought home from school.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="more-49809"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the twist: while we’re busy swigging elderberry syrup and guzzling orange juice, one &lt;em&gt;very popular&lt;/em&gt; drink might be quietly sabotaging our efforts. And no, it’s not your flatmate’s dodgy green smoothie. It’s &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;alcohol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="A_sneaky_saboteur_to_your_bodys_defences"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A sneaky saboteur to your body’s defences&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might enjoy the occasional drink to unwind after a long day, and who could blame you? But if you’re genuinely looking to &lt;strong&gt;strengthen your immune system&lt;/strong&gt;, you might want to keep an eye on how much you pour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, alcohol is a proper thief when it comes to &lt;strong&gt;hydration&lt;/strong&gt;. Even a couple of glasses can send your body into a state of dehydration thanks to its diuretic effect—basically, it makes you lose more fluid than you take in. According to dietitian Roxana Ehsani, this lack of hydration doesn’t do your immune system any favours. It disrupts hormone levels, notably vasopressin, which controls kidney function. The result? You wee more, lose vital &lt;a href="https://chicagoaudible.com/can-drinking-warm-water-in-the-morning-really-burn-belly-fat/" data-type="post" data-id="49580"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and your immune system is left sputtering instead of sprinting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="Gut_feelings_and_sugary_traps"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Gut feelings and sugary traps&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever had a big night and felt like your stomach was staging a protest the next day? That’s because alcohol hits your gut first, and not in a gentle way. It messes with your &lt;strong&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/strong&gt;, the community of good bacteria that plays a key role in immune health. When these helpful microbes are damaged, your gut can’t support immune cells the way it should, leaving you more vulnerable to bugs and viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And let’s not forget the sugar. Many alcoholic drinks—especially cocktails—are loaded with it. That tropical number with the mini umbrella? Probably packed with syrups and fruit juices that &lt;strong&gt;spike your &lt;a href="https://chicagoaudible.com/one-spoon-every-morning-this-food-effectively-regulates-blood-sugar/" data-type="post" data-id="49748"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, interfering with immune cell production. So, while you’re enjoying that sweet sip, your immune system might be running on fumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="When_%E2%80%98just_one_more_becomes_too_much"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;When ‘just one more’ becomes too much&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about the odd glass of wine at dinner. Regular or &lt;strong&gt;excessive alcohol consumption&lt;/strong&gt; adds up. Drink too much and all these effects—dehydration, gut disruption, sugar overload—start stacking like a house of cards. According to public health guidelines, adults should stick to no more than two drinks per day, and not every day. Go beyond that and you’re not just risking sniffles—you’re potentially inviting in more serious conditions like &lt;strong&gt;cardiovascular disease and certain cancers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if your aim is to stay fit, healthy, and relatively bug-free this winter, you might want to swap that second glass of red for a soothing herbal tea—or better yet, a hot cocoa if you’re feeling indulgent. Your immune system will thank you later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="A_toast_to_moderation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A toast to moderation&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, this doesn’t mean you have to give up alcohol entirely. Life’s too short not to enjoy a well-earned tipple now and then. But it’s worth remembering that &lt;strong&gt;even small daily habits&lt;/strong&gt; have a long-term impact on our health. A bit less booze, a bit more water (or even milk, surprisingly good for hydration), and you’re setting yourself up for fewer sick days and more winter walks in the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, balance is everything. And sometimes, looking after yourself starts with what’s in your glass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Chicago Audible</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQWUY5cFg1UDBwLWZTbDhFdGNFUXJCQ2w3NkgwZHZ6ZVVkVGpqYjFycHpXN1Z5QUFwMGtBWGJGYjhvQ2hnNlRycFlvNHh0QmZ0eDJ1T2V5NVJXZXVNaC1GZ0puTzhOeS1UUDNGWWdWT2lnNlhTLUVva2RQSTRfdjZzdzZOd1liVDQxRXVWbVQzcXZsOFAz</guid></item><item><title>从胃瘫痪到视力丧失： Ozempic面临超过20亿美元的诉讼-商业标准</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="parent_top_div"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Ozempic, the diabetes drug turned global weight-loss phenomenon, is under intense legal and medical scrutiny. Once promoted as a breakthrough drug and a safe shortcut to shedding kilos, this injectable is facing over $2 billion in lawsuits in the US, with patients reporting severe side effects ranging from stomach paralysis to vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Why is Ozempic getting sued?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ozempic, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist originally designed for diabetes, shot to global fame when celebrities and social media influencers started using it for slimming down. Social media feeds were flooded with “before and after” reels, driving demand worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small class="brtag"&gt; &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	But lawsuits are piling up. According to lawsuittracker.org, more than 1,200 GLP-1 lawsuits have been consolidated into multidistrict litigation in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.business-standard.com/health/ozempic-face-teeth-tongue-side-effects-weight-loss-drugs-125052600597_1.html?1755598377" target="_blank"&gt;Patients reported conditions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; such as gastroparesis (stomach paralysis), vomiting, and vision problems, alleging that Novo Nordisk failed to provide adequate warnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;small class="brtag"&gt; &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The website of the Law Offices of Melinda J Helbock, a San Diego-based firm, notes that the total liability could exceed $2 billion, with numbers expected to rise further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What does Novo Nordisk have to say?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Helbock's website, Novo Nordisk continues to deny wrongdoing, stating that Ozempic is safe when used as directed. However, plaintiffs argue that the company failed to fully disclose the risks, especially for its off-label use in weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small class="brtag"&gt; &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company insists Ozempic is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for diabetes only and that labels already warn about gastrointestinal side effects. They argue that off-label weight loss use has exploded beyond its intended scope, thanks to social media hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small class="brtag"&gt; &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But legal experts say the $2 billion lawsuits could be just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small class="brtag"&gt; &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Not all users face severe side effects. Many have lost weight successfully without major issues. But experts warn that, as evident from multiple reports of side effects, short-term gains may come with long-term risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What doctors advise for current users&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;small class="brtag"&gt; &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Not all users face severe side effects, and many have reported successful weight loss without major issues. Still, experts caution that short-term gains may carry long-term risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small class="brtag"&gt; &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Doctors recommend that those already using Ozempic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small class="brtag"&gt; &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Schedule regular check-ups for gut health and vision&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Report persistent nausea, vomiting, or changes in eyesight&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Consider lifestyle-based weight-loss methods as safer, long-term alternatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Ozempic is not a magic wand for weight loss. While it can help shed kilos quickly—fueling its popularity—it comes with risks. The mounting billion-dollar lawsuits underscore a wider lesson: in the battle against weight, there is no free lunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;small class="brtag"&gt; &lt;/small&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquoteBG styleQ1"&gt;

Kennedy Jr., the routine annual vaccine review and approval process has become clouded with doubt and uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorado hasn’t waited for the air to clear. Colorado lawmakers &lt;a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb25-1027"&gt;passed a bill&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year along party lines, later signed into law by the governor, which directs the state’s board of health to &lt;a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/06/18/new-colorado-law-vaccine-recommendations-rfk-jr-cdc/"&gt;take into consideration&lt;/a&gt; recommendations from other high-profile doctors' groups, not just the CDC panel — the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices or &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html"&gt;ACIP&lt;/a&gt; — whose membership was overhauled under RFK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes come after vaccine policy became more controversial during the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood immunization rates have &lt;a href="https://www.cpr.org/show-segment/new-study-gives-a-shot-in-the-arm-to-declining-toddler-vaccination-rates/"&gt;fallen in recent years&lt;/a&gt;, below where &lt;a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/04/01/colorado-below-herd-immunity-for-measles/"&gt;experts would suggest&lt;/a&gt; for broad community protection. With back-to-school season here and the respiratory virus season approaching, many questions are swirling about new policies and recommendations, CPR Health Reporter John Daley interviewed a key Colorado decision-maker: &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/press-release/colorado-department-of-public-health-and-environment-names-dr-ned-calonge-new-chief"&gt;Dr. Ned Calonge&lt;/a&gt;, the state’s chief medical officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator"&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-group has-layout-flex has-orientation-vertical article__contained"&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited for length and clarity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Daley: I wonder if you could give folks an update on where things stand with fall vaccines. I would imagine you're getting a lot of questions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Ned Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; We've been getting questions from vaccine providers, and we expect there will be enough vaccines for everyone who wants one this coming season. The supplies for vaccines are managed nationally, and we know providers across the state have already placed orders to assure availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image article__contained size-full"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credit"&gt;Ed Andrieski/AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-block-image__caption"&gt;Dr. Ned Calonge, right, Colorado's acting chief medical officer, during a news conference in Denver, Tuesday, Sept. 17, 2002. (AP Photo/Ed Andrieski)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Is there confusion about the schedule, as it's normally done, coming from the federal government with the new administration?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; I think the key area of confusion has been the COVID vaccine recommendation for pregnant persons. We are continuing to recommend a vaccine for that group as protective against COVID during pregnancy. The latest version of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html"&gt;ACIP&lt;/a&gt; (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) recommendations was just silent on that previous recommendation, and there's been no new evidence of issues of safety in that population. So, we're telling providers that our recommendation is to continue to follow the recommendation as it was in place in January of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley: So that would be essentially relying on the guidance from the former vaccine panel? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge: &lt;/strong&gt; Yes. The one additional issue is that the &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/?srsltid=AfmBOop8iKHT1qQgzyhNAkWjvsTM91souW4TVAjoJAZwCdS-thRKP9lP"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; is working on putting forward their authoritative vaccine schedule, so that there's an updated authoritative schedule for providers and states to base their decision-making on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley: When do you expect that'll be out?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; Great question. And I don't have the answer to that. I know that they're actively working on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt; And does that tie in with the state law that the legislature passed this past session that gives the state and the Board of Health the option of following guidance from some of these other high-profile medical groups?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; That's correct. So the legislation said we could bring in recommendations from other evidence and science-based authoritative bodies, both nationally and internationally, as we set our schedule and as the &lt;a href="https://doi.colorado.gov/"&gt;Division of insurance&lt;/a&gt; sets their funding requirements for insurers in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Let's talk a little bit about flu and RSV vaccines. Has the CDC signed off on those for this fall yet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; The only change in the flu vaccine is the elimination of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html#:~:text=Thimerosal%20is%20added%20to%20vials,process%20to%20prevent%20germ%20growth."&gt;thimerosal&lt;/a&gt;, which is a mercury-containing preservative. The last place that had been used was in multi-dose vials for flu vaccine. What the manufacturers have done is take the thimerosal out and moved all of their production to single-dose prefilled syringes. So there is no thimerosal in any other vaccine in the United States. And so this move will take thimerosal out of all vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;It seems like the biggest questions are still out there about COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, correct?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; The schedule continues to have the vaccine recommended but with shared decision-making. So the provider would say, ‘Here's the vaccine, here's what we know about benefits, here's what we know about harms.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, that's the way we think you should do vaccines all the time. That it's a choice issue for individuals to decide whether or not they wanna be immunized. It has full approval for use in people 65 years and older. That's the Moderna product, and then 6 months to 64 years, if you have an underlying condition putting you at high risk. And then this issue about the availability or the ability to provide shared decision making. So one of the things that is swirling around is whether or not the FDA will undo Pfizer's EUA (&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization"&gt;emergency use authorization&lt;/a&gt;) for the pediatric COVID vaccines. That one goes down to four months, and if they don't have that emergency use authorization, then Moderna will be the vaccine that we have available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley: A lot of people are wondering if they'll be able to get COVID vaccines this fall. And this would be not just for kids, but also adults that want to get them. What would you say to people who have those questions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; We have adequate supply for this coming fall of COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley:  Will it be the latest updated COVID vaccine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, it's the one that we have now, and it's the one that we would continue to use based on what we're seeing in terms of COVID infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley: That's even if they don't give approval to Pfizer, there will still be the Moderna version?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; Correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley: What's your main message for Coloradans about all this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns article__contained"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-pullquote__blockquote"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-pullquote__quote"&gt;The most effective way to prevent these infections during the upcoming fall — we're talking about influenza, RSV and COVID-19 — is to be immunized. The shots are safe and effective. There are adverse reactions, but they're very rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="wp-block-pullquote__cite"&gt;Ned Calonge&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; The message remains the same... On the whole, when you look at the trade-off between your risk of getting disease — which is still out there for COVID-19, comes back every year, for flu, and now we have new tools against RSV — the best protection is to be immunized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley: And what would you like Coloradans to understand about this new state law that's now in effect that gives the state Board of Health the option of following recommendations from these other high-profile medical groups? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it's important to know that what Colorado's done with legislation is to be able to continue our role to share science-based information from a range of these respective public health experts so that Coloradans can make informed health decisions. So that they can make their decisions based on what a range of different experts say. Especially as we've seen changes in the federal panel for the ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Do you feel like that protects Coloradans and will give them an additional level of safety looking down the road?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; It's my strong feeling this gives Coloradans additional choice to protect their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daley: Have you heard of any pushback from the Health and Human Services department on that, or do you anticipate any?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calonge:&lt;/strong&gt; We haven't had any pushback at this point, and I'm always reticent to make predictions, especially about the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Colorado Public Radio</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 10:07:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxOYU1qY2xHWTNUMEtTekpJZ2daVE5TVkJqcEl5UmZyWDNGVEhxWkYtRFhaSkVMR3hhM0R5cDE2bFZfX3BjV1lVcG5UZ0hYLWVlMjJkX3RpWU9CSnVpRE43ZnpIajJwQUVQNWdhQWVKcGRjR2JxX0VyUEJBUHNVakZSNmNJQQ</guid></item><item><title>皮肤科医生分享在您的抗衰老护肤程序中不可使用的护肤品以及实际有效的护肤品-非常简单</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxOMW9Qb0JfT09xRFRXMjc2Z25Nekh2S0pTbW9NaDBaUExuN3FmaXlhUVR3TXYzWWtvSWVGanF4WEg1ODNRMmRMV2hYaWpZd1dlajRmdlh1NnZ3cmtoWE0wUlFHd2ZvTHY3azhoWTZEMFBBdDQ0eGNJR0doa1d4R1JWYjJ4NFFMT1lIMGdaNG14ZWxHazdkZ0hpZ19iekJjdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="realsimple-sc-page_1-0" class="comp realsimple-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to establishing a daily anti-aging skincare routine, it may not be clear where you should start.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With roughly two decades of experience in both medical and cosmetic dermatology, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/drdendy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nocaes"&gt;Dr. Engelman&lt;/a&gt; has extensive knowledge in individualized treatments that address fine lines, loss of elasticity, pigmentation, and overall skin health. “Over the years, I’ve refined approaches that help mature skin look rejuvenated, healthy, and naturally radiant,” she says. She shared her seven go-to products under $50 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;node=205662310011&amp;amp;tag=realsimple-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;from Amazon&lt;/a&gt; to treat these issues, including CeraVe moisturizing cream, La Roche-Posay serum, EltaMd sunscreen, and RoC retinol cream.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Harsh physical scrubs can create micro-tears in the skin, according to Dr. Engelman, which causes irritation and long-term sensitivity. She explained that polyhydroxy acids (PHAs) help encourage cell turnover while maintaining skin moisture, which is key for a long-term youthful appearance.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dr. Engelman shared that alcohol-heavy toners can strip the skin of its natural oils, disrupting the skin barrier and increasing dryness and irritation. “I love the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paulas-Choice-Niacinamide-Enlarged-Wrinkles-Normal/dp/B01GF1EOB8?tag=realsimple-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;Paula’s Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster Serum&lt;/a&gt;, which strengthens the skin barrier, refines pores, and improves skin tone without stripping moisture,” she said.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Niacinamide is anti-inflammatory and, according to the doctor, “works beautifully alongside retinoids and vitamin C.” This, she shares, is because niacinamide soothes inflammation and strengthens the skin barrier, which reduces irritation from retinoids and sensitivity from vitamin C. “At the same time, it doesn’t interfere with their effects, so you get smoother cell turnover from retinoids, brightening and antioxidant protection from vitamin C, and balanced, calm skin from niacinamide.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to Dr. Engelman—and most dermatologists—SPF is the single most important anti-aging product you can own. She noted that using SPF consistently slows down aging, preserves collagen, and keeps your skin healthy long-term. “Sun exposure is a primary factor of premature aging. No serum, cream, or treatment can undo consistent UV damage, but daily broad-spectrum SPF protects your skin at the source,” she explained. “It’s the foundation for every other anti-aging strategy.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And while your favorite foundation with SPF might make your complexion look flawless on the surface, it might provide “insufficient sun protection, leaving skin vulnerable to UV damage and premature aging." Make sure you’re also wearing sunscreen meant for the face—tinted sunscreen, namely, offers sun protection with a little bit of color coverage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “My favorite [tinted sunscreen] is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/EltaMD-Clear-Tinted-Sunscreen-Face/dp/B00ZPWR0N8?th=1&amp;amp;tag=realsimple-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;EltaMD UV Clear Tinted Broad-Spectrum SPF 46&lt;/a&gt;, which offers UVA/UVB and visible light protection with niacinamide and antioxidants. Niacinamide strengthens the skin and evens tone, while antioxidants neutralize free radicals from the sun and pollution, as per Dr. Engelman.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dr. Engelman says using strong prescription treatments on your own without medical guidance, over a long period, is a no. Not only can this damage your skin, but steroids can thin it, while hydroquinone can irritate or even darken skin over time (which is the opposite effect of what you desire). Azelaic acid is gentler, calms skin, lightens pigmentation, and is safe to use with most other ingredients, Dr. Engelman added.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pure coconut oil and other occlusives can be particularly problematic for acne-prone skin as the ingredients can clog pores, worsening breakouts, according to Dr. Engelman. “I love &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Cream-Daily-Moisturizer/dp/B000YJ2SLG?th=1&amp;amp;tag=realsimple-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;CeraVe Moisturizing Cream&lt;/a&gt;, which replenishes ceramides, cholesterol, and fatty acids for healthy, resilient skin without clogging pores.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ceramides are lipids naturally found in your skin that help form and maintain the skin’s barrier, she explains. A strong barrier locks in moisture, protects against irritants and pollution, and prevents dryness and sensitivity. “Using ceramides in skincare restores this barrier, keeping skin healthy, hydrated, and resilient.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Frequent use of harsh masks can strip the skin and cause irritation rather than firming, noted Dr. Engelman. “Instead of stripping, this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Roche-Posay-Hyalu-Hyaluronic-Anti-Wrinkle-Concentrate/dp/B075VX4QVM?th=1&amp;amp;tag=realsimple-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;La Roche-Posay serum&lt;/a&gt; deeply hydrates and plumps, temporarily reducing the appearance of fine lines and improving skin elasticity.

All studies were done in young (2–3 months) or aged (18–22 months) male mice that were not involved in any previous procedures. The numbers of mice used to result in statistically significant differences were calculated using standard power calculations with &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; = 0.05 and a power of 0.8. We used an online tool (&lt;a href="https://www.stat.uiowa.edu/~rlenth/Power/index.html"&gt;https://www.stat.uiowa.edu/~rlenth/Power/index.html&lt;/a&gt;) to calculate power and sample size based on experience with the respective tests, variability of the assays and inter-individual differences within groups. Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions under a 12-hour light/dark cycle, with humidity maintained at 30–70% and temperature at 68–79 °F (20–26 °C). All animal handling and use were in accordance with institutional guidelines approved by the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec4"&gt;Tissue collection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were anesthetized with 87.5 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ketamine and 12.5 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; xylazine and transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS. Tissues were removed and processed for subsequent analysis. To process the brains, either the hippocampus was subdissected and snap frozen or the whole brain was fixed in phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 48 hours before cryoprotection with 30% sucrose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec5"&gt;Primary neuron cultures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal and cortical neurons were isolated from E17 C57Bl/6J mouse embryos using the papain dissociation system (Worthington, cat. no.

Media were partially changed every 4–5 days. On day in vitro 8 (DIV8), neurons were infected with lentivirus at multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 1 and processed 10 days later (DIV18) for immunocytochemistry. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (10 minutes), washed and stained with MAP2 (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. M1406, RRID: AB_477171), anti-GFP (Aves Labs, cat. no. GFP-1020) or anti-turboGFP (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. PA5–22688, RRID: AB_2540616) antibodies to confirm infection, along with Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no.

Gene Ontology enrichment was performed using Panther.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec16"&gt;Single-nuclei RNA-seq analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuclei were submitted to the UCSF IHG Genomics Core for processing with the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3′ kit. Approximately 10,000 nuclei per sample were captured, and cDNA libraries were prepared following manufacturer protocols (10x Genomics). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S2. Base calls were demultiplexed using Cell Ranger version 7.1, and raw FASTQ files were processed to generate expression matrices, including intronic reads. Each sample yielded approximately 13,100–15,950 nuclei, with a mean depth of 27,000 reads per nucleus and approximately 44% sequencing saturation. Data were analyzed in R version 4.2.2. Ambient RNA contamination was removed using SoupX, and samples were integrated with Seurat (2,000 variable genes, 20 dimensions). Nuclei expressing fewer than 300 or more than 5,000 genes, or more than 2% mitochondrial transcripts, were excluded. Genes detected in fewer than three nuclei were filtered out. Doublets and technical artifacts were removed, and expression was log normalized. Dimensionality reduction was performed using PCA, and clustering was conducted with the Louvain algorithm on the first 20 principal components. UMAP was applied for two-dimensional visualization. Differential expression was calculated using Seurat (min.pct = 0.05, log fold change &amp;gt; 0.15, pseudocount = 0.1). Genes inconsistent across replicates were excluded. Visualizations included violin plots, UMAPs and heatmaps from average expression matrices. Volcano plots were generated using EnhancedVolcano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec17"&gt;Synaptosomes protein sample preparation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To obtain sufficient synaptosomes for proteomic analysis, hippocampus and cortex from multiple mice were pooled.

Tissue was homogenized in sucrose buffer with phosphatase inhibitors (Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;VO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, NaF, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, sodium tartrate, fenvalerate and okadaic acid) and PUGNAc, followed by differential centrifugation. Synaptic membranes were collected at the 1.0–1.2 M sucrose interface and pelleted. Frozen pellets were resuspended in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, phosphatase inhibitor cocktails II/III and PUGNAc. Protein concentration was measured by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each sample (1.5 mg) was reduced with 2.5 mM TCEP at 56 °C for 1 hour, alkylated with 5 mM iodoacetamide (45 minutes, room temperature, dark), diluted to 1 M guanidine and digested overnight at 37 °C with sequencing-grade trypsin (1:50 enzyme:substrate). Peptides were acidified with formic acid, desalted (C18 Sep-Pak) and dried by SpeedVac. Tryptic peptides were labeled with TMT-6plex reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol: TMT126–131 for three young and three aged samples. Labeling efficiency was confirmed on a Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap. Labeled peptides were quenched with 5% hydroxylamine, pooled, desalted and dried. Peptides were separated using high-pH reverse-phase chromatography on a Gemini 5-μm C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm; Phenomenex). A 9–49% acetonitrile gradient in 20 mM ammonium formate (pH 10) was run over 20 ml at 550 μl min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, collecting 60 fractions. Fractions were combined (two per sample) into 12 final samples and dried for downstream analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec18"&gt;Mass spectrometry analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tandem mass tag (TMT)-labeled peptides were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a NanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters). Peptides were separated on a 50-cm × 75-μm ID, 2-μm C18 EASY-Spray column using a linear gradient from 3.5% to 30% solvent B over 185 minutes. MS1 scans were acquired from 375 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; to 1,500 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; at 120,000 resolution (AGC target: 4.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;). Ions with charge states 2–7 were selected using a 1.0-&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; window, with dynamic exclusion (30 seconds) and MIPS filtering enabled. Higher-energy collisional dissociation MS2 spectra were acquired using stepped collision energies (30%/35%/40%) and detected in the Orbitrap at 30,000 resolution (AGC: 5.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;; maximum injection time: 100 ms). The scan cycle was set to 3 seconds. Peaklists were generated using Proteome Discoverer version 2.2 and searched against the SwissProt &lt;i&gt;Mus musculus&lt;/i&gt; database (downloaded 6 September 2016, with decoy sequences) using Protein Prospector version 5.21.1. Searches assumed trypsin specificity with up to two missed cleavages. Fixed modifications included carbamidomethylation (Cys) and TMT-6plex labels (Lys and N termini); variable modifications included N-terminal acetylation, oxidation (Met), pyro-glutamate formation (Gln) and N-terminal Met loss (with or without acetylation). A maximum of two variable modifications per peptide was allowed. Identifications were filtered to a 1% false discovery rate at both peptide and protein levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec19"&gt;TMT mass spectrometry data analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data were filtered to only include peptides unique to a single protein. Quantitation of TMT data was performed by calculating ratios of reporter ion peak intensities between conditions along with variance for each ratio and median normalized. Protein abundances were normalized by the median of ratio distributions. The age-dependent changes were determined using a normalized median log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Aged/Young ratio of at least 1.0, corresponding to a 2.0 fold change with age and a −log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value greater than 1.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec20"&gt;RT–qPCR&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quantify mRNA expression levels, equal amounts of cDNA were synthesized using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 4368813) and then mixed with SYBR Fast mix (Kapa Biosystems) and primers. β-actin was amplified as an internal control. RT–qPCR was performed in the CFX384 Real Time System (Bio-Rad). Each sample and primer set was run in triplicate, and relative expression levels were calculated using the 2&lt;sup&gt;−ΔΔ&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec21"&gt;Western blot analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western blotting was performed on both mouse hippocampal tissue and primary hippocampal neurons. For tissue studies, hippocampi were dissected, flash frozen and pulverized prior to lysis in RIPA buffer (Abcam, ab156034) with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 4693116001). Lysates were mixed with 4× LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen, NP0008), resolved by SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBST and probed with the following primary antibodies: anti-GAPDH (Abcam, ab8245, 1:5,000), β-tubulin (Covance, MMS-435P, 1:1,000), NR2A (Sigma-Aldrich, 07-632, 1:1,000), synapsin (Abcam, ab18814, 1:1,000) and AMPA receptor (Abcam, ab109450, 1:3,000). HRP-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (Invitrogen, A15999, 1:2,000) and anti-rabbit (GE Healthcare, NA934V, 1:2,000) secondaries were used for detection with ECL reagents (GE Healthcare). Signals were imaged with a ChemiDoc system (Bio-Rad) and quantified in FIJI/ImageJ (version 2.0.0).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For cell-based experiments, primary neurons were cultured from E17 mouse embryos, treated as indicated, lysed under the same conditions and processed in parallel. Quantification was normalized to loading controls (GAPDH, β-tubulin or β-actin) and to the control group. Each tissue datapoint represents an individual animal; each cell culture datapoint represents a biological replicate. Statistical comparisons were made using two-tailed unpaired Student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec22"&gt;Iron quantification&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron imaging was performed using a modified protocol from Wu et al.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 20" title="Wu, Y. et al.

Mouse brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (24 hours, 4 °C), cryoprotected in 30% sucrose (3 days) and sectioned coronally at 30-μm thickness using a cryostat. Slices were stored at −20 °C in cryoprotectant. For each group, three sections from six mice per cohort were stained with technical replicates. Sections were rinsed in TBS (3×, 5 minutes), blocked in 2% BSA and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-GFP antibody (Aves Labs, cat. no. GFP-1020, 1:250). After washing, samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-chicken secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat. no. 703-545-155, 1:250) for 2 hours at room temperature. Excess antibodies were removed with TBS washes. To detect Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; simultaneously, DNAzyme-based sensors were used. Active and inactive enzyme (E/iE) strands (2 μM) and substrate strands (2.2 μM) were annealed in Bis-Tris buffer (5 mM Bis-Tris (pH 6), 40 mM sodium acetate, 200 mM NaCl) by heating to 95 °C and cooling to room temperature. Fe(II)-H5 and Fe(III)-B12 sensors were combined 1:1 with Hoechst. Brain slices were rinsed in Bis-Tris-acetate buffer, incubated in the sensor mix for 30 minutes and then washed and treated with 0.5× TrueBlack Lipofuscin Quencher (Biotium, PSF006) in 70% ethanol for 30 seconds. Slides were mounted with Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech) and imaged using a Nikon spinning disk or Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope with a ×20 objective. Channels used included 405 nm (Hoechst), 488 nm (GFP), 546 nm (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and 647 nm (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;). &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; stacks (four steps, 5-μm intervals) covering the hippocampus were acquired via tiled scan. Images were analyzed in ImageJ; maximum intensity projections were used. Background correction was done by subtracting the average signal from inactive sensor (iErS) controls in the same region (CA1, CA2/CA3 or dentate gyrus).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec23"&gt;DNAzyme sequences&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fe(II)-H5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="u-list-style-bullet"&gt;

              &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec24"&gt;Electrophysiology&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acute hippocampal slices were prepared from 16–18-week-old male mice, 1 month after stereotaxic injection of &lt;i&gt;Ftl1&lt;/i&gt;-overexpressing (Ftl1 OE) or control virus. All procedures were approved by the IACUC of AfaSci (protocol no. 0223). Mice (28–42 g) were deeply anesthetized with halothane and decapitated. Brains were rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold, oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; continuously bubbled with 95% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). ACSF composition (in mM) was as follows: 130 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 KH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 2.4 CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1.3 MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 26 NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and 10 glucose (pH 7.4). Transverse hippocampal slices (400 μm) were prepared using a tissue slicer (Stoelting) and recovered for ≥1 hour at room temperature in oxygenated ACSF prior to recording. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded in submerged slices perfused with oxygenated ACSF (flow rate: 1.75 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; DynaMAX pump) at room temperature. Glass microelectrodes (1–3 MΩ, ACSF-filled) were positioned in the stratum radiatum of CA1 to record responses evoked by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals via a concentric bipolar electrode (FHC, Inc.), placed approximately 100 μm apart. Stimuli were 0.2-ms biphasic pulses (0.4-ms total duration) delivered every 10 seconds. Input/output (I–O) curves were generated using 23 increasing current steps (20-µA increments) from threshold (20–100 µA). Test pulse intensity was set to 30–50% of the maximal response. LTP was induced using two trains of 100-Hz stimulation (100 pulses, 1-second duration, 5 seconds apart). fEPSP slope was measured from the initial negative phase using Clampfit 10.4 (Molecular Devices). Data points represent the average of three consecutive sweeps. Paired-pulse ratio (PPR) was calculated using a 50-ms interpulse interval as the ratio of the second to the first EPSP. Traces were low-pass filtered with a Gaussian filter (−3-dB cutoff: 1,260 Hz). Representative LTP traces are averages of six consecutive responses (1 minute, unfiltered). Recordings were completed within 8 hours of dissection. Data were analyzed using Clampfit 10.4, Excel and StatView 5.0. LTP was expressed as percent of baseline; the final 5 minutes were averaged for group comparisons. Results are shown as mean ± s.e.m. Statistical significance was defined as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec25"&gt;Open field&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were placed in the center of an open 40-cm × 40-cm square chamber (Kinder Scientific) with no cues or stimuli and allowed to move freely for 10 minutes.

            &lt;p&gt;Using machine learning, MIT chemical engineers have created a computational model that can predict how well any given molecule will dissolve in an organic solvent — a key step in the synthesis of nearly any pharmaceutical. This type of prediction could make it much easier to develop new ways to produce drugs and other useful molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new model, which predicts how much of a solute will dissolve in a particular solvent, should help chemists to choose the right solvent for any given reaction in their synthesis, the researchers say. Common organic solvents include ethanol and acetone, and there are hundreds of others that can also be used in chemical reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Predicting solubility really is a rate-limiting step in synthetic planning and manufacturing of chemicals, especially drugs, so there’s been a longstanding interest in being able to make better predictions of solubility,” says Lucas Attia, an MIT graduate student and one of the lead authors of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have made their &lt;a href="https://askcos.mit.edu/solprop?tab=solpred" target="_blank"&gt;model&lt;/a&gt; freely available, and many companies and labs have already started using it. The model could be particularly useful for identifying solvents that are less hazardous than some of the most commonly used industrial solvents, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are some solvents which are known to dissolve most things. They’re really useful, but they’re damaging to the environment, and they’re damaging to people, so many companies require that you have to minimize the amount of those solvents that you use,” says Jackson Burns, an MIT graduate student who is also a lead author of the paper. “Our model is extremely useful in being able to identify the next-best solvent, which is hopefully much less damaging to the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Green, the Hoyt Hottel Professor of Chemical Engineering and director of the MIT Energy Initiative, is the senior author of the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62717-7" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, which appears today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;. Patrick Doyle, the Robert T. Haslam Professor of Chemical Engineering, is also an author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solving solubility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new model grew out of a project that Attia and Burns worked on together in an MIT course on applying machine learning to chemical engineering problems. Traditionally, chemists have predicted solubility with a tool known as the Abraham Solvation Model, which can be used to estimate a molecule’s overall solubility by adding up the contributions of chemical structures within the molecule. While these predictions are useful, their accuracy is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, researchers have begun using machine learning to try to make more accurate solubility predictions. Before Burns and Attia began working on their new model, the state-of-the-art model for predicting solubility was a model developed in Green’s lab in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That model, known as SolProp, works by predicting a set of related properties and combining them, using thermodynamics, to ultimately predict the solubility. However, the model has difficulty predicting solubility for solutes that it hasn’t seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For drug and chemical discovery pipelines where you’re developing a new molecule, you want to be able to predict ahead of time what its solubility looks like,” Attia says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason that existing solubility models haven’t worked well is because there wasn’t a comprehensive dataset to train them on. However, in 2023 a new dataset called BigSolDB was released, which compiled data from nearly 800 published papers, including information on solubility for about 800 molecules dissolved about more than 100 organic solvents that are commonly used in synthetic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attia and Burns decided to try training two different types of models on this data. Both of these models represent the chemical structures of molecules using numerical representations known as embeddings, which incorporate information such as the number of atoms in a molecule and which atoms are bound to which other atoms. Models can then use these representations to predict a variety of chemical properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the models used in this study, known as FastProp and developed by Burns and others in Green’s lab, incorporates “static embeddings.” This means that the model already knows the embedding for each molecule before it starts doing any kind of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other model, ChemProp, learns an embedding for each molecule during the training, at the same time that it learns to associate the features of the embedding with a trait such as solubility. This model, developed across multiple MIT labs, has already been used for tasks such as antibiotic discovery, lipid nanoparticle design, and predicting chemical reaction rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers trained both types of models on over 40,000 data points from BigSolDB, including information on the effects of temperature, which plays a significant role in solubility. Then, they tested the models on about 1,000 solutes that had been withheld from the training data. They found that the models’ predictions were two to three times more accurate than those of SolProp, the previous best model, and the new models were especially accurate at predicting variations in solubility due to temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being able to accurately reproduce those small variations in solubility due to temperature, even when the overarching experimental noise is very large, was a really positive sign that the network had correctly learned an underlying solubility prediction function,” Burns says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accurate predictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers had expected that the model based on ChemProp, which is able to learn new representations as it goes along, would be able to make more accurate predictions. However, to their surprise, they found that the two models performed essentially the same. That suggests that the main limitation on their performance is the quality of the data, and that the models are performing as well as theoretically possible based on the data that they’re using, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ChemProp should always outperform any static embedding when you have sufficient data,” Burns says. “We were blown away to see that the static and learned embeddings were statistically indistinguishable in performance across all the different subsets, which indicates to us that that the data limitations that are present in this space dominated the model performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The models could become more accurate, the researchers say, if better training and testing data were available — ideally, data obtained by one person or a group of people all trained to perform the experiments the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the big limitations of using these kinds of compiled datasets is that different labs use different methods and experimental conditions when they perform solubility tests. That contributes to this variability between different datasets,” Attia says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the model based on FastProp makes its predictions faster and has code that is easier for other users to adapt, the researchers decided to make that one, known as FastSolv, available to the public. Multiple pharmaceutical companies have already begun using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are applications throughout the drug discovery pipeline,” Burns says. “We’re also excited to see, outside of formulation and drug discovery, where people may use this model.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded, in part, by the U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;As students head back to school, a checkup on which vaccines are needed is usually on the list. WTOP looks into which ones are especially important this year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines are victims of their own success,” said Dr. David Higgins, assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. “They have been so successful that we don’t routinely see diseases that many of our parents or grandparents saw, like polio or measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said some parents don’t want to give their children some vaccines because they haven’t heard of cases of these diseases recently and don’t believe it’s necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As pediatricians, we went into this field because we care deeply about the health of children, and we want to partner with parents to make sure they’re making decisions that are truly informed with good information to keep their children healthy,” Higgins said of how he would persuade parents to think otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are the vaccines that parents should put on their list?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing, across the country, outbreaks of measles, and we’re having one of our worst measles years in decades. Additionally, we’re seeing, unfortunately, outbreaks of pertussis, or whooping cough,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is very contagious, and symptoms can set in anywhere from 72 hours to two weeks after exposure, which is why doctors encourage monitoring for the illness for up to two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some of those cases have been extremely serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have had multiple cases where children, usually young infants, have died from whooping cough,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreaks of vaccine-preventable illnesses could be indicative of changing attitudes toward vaccines. Nationally, the number of kindergartners getting required vaccines has dropped and the number of children with vaccine exemptions hit an all-time high. Higgins said that can be dangerous when those kids go back to school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to know that vaccines only keep these diseases at bay, and as soon as vaccination rates drop, it’s not a matter of if, but when, diseases like measles will come back into a community,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The groundbreaking Language Velocity Field (LVF) method is helping researchers trace dispersion patterns of languages, including &lt;a href="https://greekreporter.com/2024/01/16/greek-pronunciation-bronze-age-today/"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;, across the world&lt;a href="https://greekreporter.com/2024/01/16/greek-pronunciation-bronze-age-today/"&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spatial evolution of languages can help deepen our understanding of people diffusion and cultural spread. The language velocity field estimation is different from the frequently used phylogeographic approach which cannot fully explain the language evolution induced by the horizontal contact among languages, such as borrowing and areal diffusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of language evolution, particularly its spatial dispersion, offers valuable insights into our collective past. Traditional approaches, such as the phylogeographic approach, often miss the complexity of language evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-1 ai-viewport-2 ai-insert-48-56682498" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-48-56682498" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="48"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LVF estimation is the product of a new study, published by the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44430-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications &lt;/em&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt;. It is a computational approach that steps beyond the limitations of previous methods, providing a more comprehensive understanding of language dispersal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LVF incorporates both vertical and horizontal dimensions of language change. This distinction is crucial in multilingual regions, where languages often borrow from and influence each other, leading to a more complex evolutionary pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-50-28609380" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-50-28609380" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="50"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How LVF Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Language Velocity Field method first creates a velocity field that shows how linguistic traits change over time, accurately capturing the essence of both horizontal contact and vertical divergence. This field is similar to the phylogenetic tree but with an expanded scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then LVF projects this field into geographic space, thereby outlining language dispersal trajectories based on linguistic relatedness and geography. This new method has been tested by simulating one thousand datasets and then being used to figure out how major agricultural language families, such as the &lt;a href="https://greekreporter.com/2023/11/03/history-greek-language-throughout-time/"&gt;Indo-European to which the Greek language belongs&lt;/a&gt;, Sino-Tibetan, Bantu, and Arawak spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings underscore the important role of agricultural languages in mirroring demographic and cultural spreads over the past ten thousand years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Close to the Anatolian Hypothesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study appears to align more closely with Colin Renfrew’s Anatolian hypothesis, proposed in the 1980s, for the distribution of Indo-European languages. It posits that the spread of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_mj64nrmnM"&gt;Indo-European languages&lt;/a&gt; was closely tied to the diffusion of agriculture from Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) around 8,000 to 9,500 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-803847" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Affinity between Anatolian and Aegean languages according to the Anatolian hypothesis. The &lt;a href="https://greekreporter.com/2021/02/08/greek-language-not-dying-merely-changing/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="7" title="Greek language"&gt;Greek language&lt;/a&gt; is an independent branch of the Indo-European family of languages. Credit: Greek Reporter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LVF study’s results, which show that the paths of language families used in farming are similar to population movements inferred from ancient DNA and archaeological data, support the theory that language spread and agricultural growth are linked. Specifically, the LVF approach identified the dispersal center of Indo-European languages in the Fertile Crescent. It is an area closely associated with the earliest known agricultural developments and within proximity to Anatolia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results suggest a stronger link between &lt;a href="https://greekreporter.com/2024/01/16/greek-pronunciation-bronze-age-today/"&gt;the spread of Greek&lt;/a&gt; and other Indo-European languages and the spread of agriculture in Anatolia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach not only enriches our comprehension of linguistic development but also offers insights into broader historical narratives. It provides a more holistic view of human history. The LVF method helps unravel the complex story of human languages and their journey across time and space.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In what sounds like the plot from a sci-fi movie, scientists have isolated an incredibly rare immune mutation to create a &lt;a href="https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/one-universal-antiviral-rule-them-all" target="_blank"&gt;universal antiviral treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only present in a few dozen people worldwide, ISG15 immunodeficiency causes people to be more susceptible to certain bacterial illnesses, but it also grants the people with this condition immunity to known viruses. Researchers think that the constant, mild inflammation these individuals experience is at the root of the immunoresponse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where things get really interesting is how the researchers have found a way to stimulate protein production of the most beneficial 10 proteins of the 60 created by the natural mutation using 10 mRNA sequences inside a lipid nanoparticle. Lead researcher [Dusan Bogunovic] says “we have yet to find a virus that can break through the therapy’s defenses.” Researchers hope the treatment can be administered to first responders as a sort of biological Personal protective equipment (PPE) against the next pandemic since it would likely work against unknown viruses before new targeted vaccines could be developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamsters and mice were given this treatment via nasal drip, but how about &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/09/29/intranasal-vaccines-a-potential-off-ramp-for-coronavirus-pandemics/"&gt;intranasal vaccines&lt;/a&gt; when it comes time for human trials?

Geroscience is a new discipline that aims to define and modify aging-related biological pathways, slow age-related disability, prevent age-related diseases, and increase disability-free survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2837435" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;review in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; outlines the aims, methods, recent advances, and ongoing challenges of geroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review was authored by Stephen B. Kritchevsky, PhD, Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine, Sticht Center for Healthy Aging and Alzheimer’s Prevention, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and Steven R. Cummings, MD, California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute, San Francisco, and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Italy, the prevention of aging is particularly relevant. &lt;a href="https://www.istat.it/storage/rapporto-annuale/2023/Rapporto-Annuale-2023.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Data from the Italian National Institute of Statistics (2023)&lt;/a&gt; show that 24.1% of the Italian population — 14.2 million people — is older than 65 years, making Italy the world’s second-oldest country after Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2050, 35% of Italians are expected to be 65 years or older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2023 &lt;a href="https://osservatoriosullasalute.it/osservasalute/rapporto-osservasalute-2023" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Osservasalute Report&lt;/a&gt; found that 87% of Italian senior citizens live with at least one chronic condition, and 67% have two or more, at an annual cost to the National Health Service exceeding €66 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traditional Limits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disease-specific prevention has shown notable results. For example, statins lower the risk for composite cardiovascular events by 28% in primary prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the authors emphasized significant limitations: “Disease-focused approaches to prevent and treat conditions do not address age-related health issues such as fatigue, mobility limitations, and frailty that are common even in the absence of overt disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frailty illustrates this gap. In the Cardiovascular Health Study, which followed more than 5200 adults for over 30 years, 16% were frailer than expected based on their comorbidities. “After adjusting for comorbidity count, the frailest group experienced 2-3 fewer years of disability-free life compared with those who were not frail,” the authors wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age is a disproportionate risk factor. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the mortality rate was seven times higher in those aged 85 years or older (1.6%) than in those aged 65-74 years (0.2%). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multimorbidity also rises sharply with age, and “the incidence of developing a third disease among those with two chronic medical conditions is 5.2% among those aged 50-59 years and 16% in those aged 70-79 years,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors emphasized that single-disease paradigms fail to account for age as the strongest determinant of risk for many diseases, including coronary heart disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, dementia, and chronic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biologic Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The geroscience hypothesis holds that biologic aging is a process distinct from chronologic aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biologic age quantifies how much a person’s physiology deviates from what would be expected of their chronologic age. For example, “a 50-year-old woman with a maximal oxygen consumption of 32 mL/kg/min, typical of women 10 years younger, would have a biologic age of 40 years,” the authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age advancement, defined as the difference between biologic and chronologic age, predicts mortality and other age-related outcomes independently of chronologic age. For example, “an individual with a biologic age 8.3 years older than their chronologic age, based on DNA methylation, had a 2.2-fold higher hazard of death than a person with a similar chronologic age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Survivors of childhood cancer also show accelerated biologic aging: “At an average age of 35 years, survivors were biologically 2.2-6.5 years older than age- and sex-matched controls using seven different approaches based on physiologic measures or DNA methylation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cellular Pathways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biologists specializing in aging have identified cellular pathways that influence lifespan, defined as the total length of life, and health span, defined as the length of life spent free from disease. These pathways involve multiple aspects of cellular physiology, including the accumulation of somatic DNA variations and the regulation and accuracy of DNA transcription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulation includes the maintenance of telomeres and regions of repetitive DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes that shorten with replication. When telomeres are too short, DNA replication cannot occur. Methylation of DNA bases and other epigenetic changes can alter gene transcription with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining protein structure and function, or protein homeostasis, is strongly associated with aging. In particular, autophagy removes damaged intracellular proteins. Other pathways are related to nutrient sensing, such as signaling induced by amino acids, insulin, or insulin-like growth factor 1, sustaining stem cell populations, and preserving mitochondrial function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variations in mitochondrial DNA accumulate with age. One genetic variant, m.&lt;em&gt;3243A&amp;gt;G&lt;/em&gt;, is linked to inherited mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episode syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a cohort of 789 adults aged 70-80 years, approximately 33% carried this variant in 6%-19% of their leukocyte mitochondrial DNA. These individuals showed slower performance, greater arterial stiffness, and reduced grip strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants with a higher abundance of this variant had increased 17-year mortality rates from dementia and stroke compared with those with the lowest abundance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caloric Restriction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caloric restriction is the most extensively studied intervention in geroscience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors reported important results: “In one strain of mice, a 20% caloric restriction increased median survival from 785 to 1096 days in females (40%) and from 807 to 999 days (24%) in males.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3185196/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;CALERIE trial&lt;/a&gt; provided the first evidence of this in humans. The CALERIE trial randomized 218 adults without obesity, aged 21-51 years, to a 2-year intervention comparing caloric restriction with no caloric restriction. The results showed significant cellular changes: Caloric restriction upregulated autophagy and DNA repair and downregulated the inflammatory response, as measured by rank-based pathway enrichment analysis. Participants in the restriction group aged 0.6 years less over the 24 months of the study than participants with no caloric restriction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incretin therapies such as semaglutide and tirzepatide offer durable caloric restriction surpassing behavioral interventions and significantly reducing clinical risks in adults with or without type 2 diabetes. Semaglutide (2.4 mg/wk) achieved 14.9% weight loss over 68 weeks. These therapies also lower cardiovascular events by 20% and all-cause mortality by 19%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metformin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review also focuses on metformin, a biguanide and first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, which may slow age-related biologic processes through its effects on multiple aging pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I, which increases AMPK [adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase] activity, thereby inhibiting mTOR complex 1 and activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha. These actions enhance autophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observational data suggest broad benefits. Among 5528 Veterans Affairs patients with type 2 diabetes, metformin users had a lower incidence of neurodegenerative diseases, including dementia, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and mild cognitive impairment compared with nonusers (11.48 vs 25.45 per 1000 person-years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among patients with type 2 diabetes hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, metformin use was associated with a lower 28-day mortality rate (16.0% vs 23.6%). But the authors noted that “Studies of the effects of metformin on patients with diabetes and prediabetes have had inconsistent results,” highlighting the need for studies designed to measure aging-related outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapamycin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapamycin, developed to prevent transplant rejection, has shown antiaging effects by acting on mTOR, a regulatory component of the cellular nutrient-sensing pathway. “Reducing mTOR activity increases cellular autophagy,” the authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Inhibition of mTORC1 [mTOR complex 1] by rapamycin increased lifespan in multiple model organisms, including mice, even when treatment began at 20 months of age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human evidence is promising but limited. “In a clinical trial of 218 adults aged 65 years or older, 6 weeks of everolimus at 0.5 mg daily or 5 mg weekly was safe and significantly improved the response to influenza vaccination compared with placebo.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors noted that “Lower intermittent doses may improve aging-related biologic pathways while producing fewer adverse effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Senescent Cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senolytic drugs are among the most novel geroscience strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Senescent cells no longer divide, resist apoptosis, and secrete inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, proteases, and other substances collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype,” the authors explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accumulation of these cells has been documented. Senescent cells accumulate with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a survey of senescent cell markers with age in human tissues, the concentration of kidney cells expressing the senescence marker p21 was 1% in five older donors aged 71-79 years, compared with less than 0.2% in five younger donors aged 19-30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In preclinical studies, eliminating p16-positive cells with AP20187, which induced apoptosis in genetically modified mice expressing p16, increased the median lifespan by up to 27% (from 624 to 793 days) and reduced cancer mortality, delayed cataract formation, and enhanced spontaneous physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early clinical trials have shown that this strategy is safe and that senolytic treatment reduces the number of cells expressing p16 and p21, two senescence markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory Hurdles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, a significant obstacle to the development of effective prevention strategies is the current regulations. “The FDA does not recognize slowing aging or reducing aging-related conditions, such as sarcopenia or mobility limitation, as approved indications.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors emphasized that “evaluating approved drugs for age-modifying effects will require broad inclusion criteria, alternative dosing regimens, and longer study durations than those used to establish therapeutic efficacy for their original indications. If multiple clinical trials, including those testing potential indications such as peripheral artery disease, heart failure, or osteoporosis, collect these outcomes, response patterns may be identified to guide future studies with measures more directly linked to specific aging-related biologic targets.” The authors also cautioned about the limitations: “This review had several limitations. First, it was not a systematic review, and the quality of the included evidence was not formally assessed. Second, geroscience is a rapidly evolving field, and relevant references may have been missed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the authors concluded that “therapies that target aging biology, including caloric restriction, metformin, senolytics, and rapalogs, may slow disease development and progression as well as functional decline in humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This represents a fundamental paradigm shift. Instead of waiting for specific diseases to develop and then treating them individually using disease-specific approaches, geroscience proposes modifying the fundamental biological processes that increase susceptibility to age-related comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapies that target the biology of aging could not only extend lifespan but, more importantly, improve the “health span” of the years lived in good health without disability or chronic disease. In today’s era of rapid population aging, these strategies could help turn aging from a problem to an opportunity, moving beyond the limits of traditional approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was translated from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.univadis.it/viewarticle/geroscienza-punta-rallentare-linvecchiamento-2025a1000l6l" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Univadis Italy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medscape</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 07:34:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOSHQxZ2ZDdWtsTlExN1pscFJxUC1ZbEp3cmt6eW9mUENOVXhRdVludjhzWGZBSVVnUEVfQ1RnNkRZN0ZYazJuVmRVaGMzV2phNVhZQzZTMDBzSTNtSVUzbzBSS2pqZjBlZ1Frb3ZDUEFocW5VOTRXQy1OR3JLODZ0YzZWbFk2eXZqMlp1b1lUd2Y4RTRjWnJScQ</guid></item><item><title>消除疫苗噪音-分派</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTFA5Z0d1eGRQM2ljaE8zeVVwbW03ZHo4V2REamJtd0x0MDUxazZGaDNTMmo0ZW9xQUN3VGFCZHNLMGxjbDh5VzUyUGQyZnkxVm9iUC1iUk91ai1kdWU2ZUo4M1hQZV9Ic3Y4empDWUZLbW83d1h4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="tight-template drop-cap"&gt;
                &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fall is coming and, with it, school. As parents, we have all the usual concerns. Did my kid get the best homeroom teacher? Do we have the right pencils? When is pajama day, and can they please give us more notice this year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To this, many parents have added a new worry: &lt;em&gt;Is my child’s class now full of a bunch of unvaccinated kids?&lt;/em&gt; There is a lot of discussion in the media and in parent groups about vaccine skepticism, declines in vaccination rates, and the possible risks of having fewer children vaccinated. The Kaiser Family Foundation recently issued a &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/kindergarten-routine-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; showing vaccination rates declining among kindergarteners. The resulting confusion may leave parents wondering: How much should I worry about this? Do I need to vet possible playdates for their family’s vaccine views?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get to some answers, it’s helpful to go to the data on a few questions. First, how much are vaccination rates really falling? Second, is our new health and human services secretary, longtime vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr., making people more wary of vaccines? Third, where might we go from here? And, finally, should you cancel those playdates?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-are-vaccination-rates-really-changing"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much are vaccination rates really changing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is much discussion of this in the media, but it’s worth both right-sizing and localizing this concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the rhetoric and volume of discussion in the media, the actual change in vaccination rates over time has been small. The graph below shows vaccination rates for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), a combination vaccine, reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for children entering kindergarten nationwide since the 2016-2017 school year. The current MMR vaccination rate is 92.5 percent, down from a peak of 95.2 percent in the 2019-2020 school year. This is a meaningful decline, to be sure, but it is still the case that the vast majority of kids entering kindergarten are fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html"&gt;Other common childhood vaccines look very similar&lt;/a&gt;, including DTaP (protecting against diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough), chicken pox, hepatitis B, and polio. All have declined some over time, with the biggest year-over-year drop during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important point is that vaccination rates vary widely from state to state. The CDC has a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html"&gt;helpful map&lt;/a&gt; that shows this at the state level. In Idaho, for example, 78.5 percent of kindergarteners have the MMR vaccine. In Connecticut, it’s 98.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://thedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-17-at-7.29.08-AM.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-91009" srcset="https://thedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-17-at-7.29.08-AM.png 1544w, https://thedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-17-at-7.29.08-AM.png?resize=300,210 300w, https://thedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-17-at-7.29.08-AM.png?resize=768,538 768w, https://thedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-17-at-7.29.08-AM.png?resize=1024,718 1024w, https://thedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-17-at-7.29.08-AM.png?resize=1536,1076 1536w, https://thedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-17-at-7.29.08-AM.png?resize=560,392 560w, https://thedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-17-at-7.29.08-AM.png?resize=1380,967 1380w, https://thedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-17-at-7.29.08-AM.png?resize=616,432 616w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention map shows the percentage of kindergarteners in each state who have received the MMR vaccine for the 2024-25 school year.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For measles, the vaccination rates to achieve “herd immunity” are 92 percent to 95 percent—meaning that if vaccination rates are at or above that level in a community, even those who are unvaccinated are likely to be protected against the disease. The relevant community is a small one—if you live in Connecticut, with a 98 percent vaccination rate, the risk of a measles outbreak is extremely small, even though vaccination rates in Idaho are lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, what really matters is even more local: the vaccination rates at your child’s school or school district, and those can vary enormously. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/upshot/measles-vaccination-california-students.html"&gt;Data from California&lt;/a&gt; before the state tightened its vaccine exemption policies in 2016 showed some schools with vaccination rates as low as 13 percent, even as the state’s overall rate was 93 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both of these points reinforce the idea that for most people, it’s likely the vaccination rates where you live and where your child attends school are very high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-rfk-jr-factor"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The RFK Jr. factor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been completely appalled at the rhetoric on vaccines coming out of the Trump administration, as I think many people have been—including people on both sides of the political aisle. Kennedy’s long-held position on vaccines is fringe, and there is a significant amount of data that refutes his claims about, for example, a link between &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.com/article/rfk-jr-autism-prevalence-causes-vaccines-science-explained/"&gt;vaccines and autism&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, RFK Jr. has been running the Department of Health and Human Services only since January, so in explaining the declines in vaccination rates that we have seen in the past several years, we cannot put blame for recent rate trends at his feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the graph above, there is a clear decline in vaccination rates that corresponds with the COVID pandemic. During the pandemic, a lot of standard pediatric care was disrupted, including routine vaccinations. The conflicts over the COVID vaccine—discomfort with vaccine mandates, misinformation around vaccine safety profiles, concerns about overuse of boosters for children—have all contributed to a distrust of the COVID vaccine, especially on the political right. That distrust seems to have spilled over to other vaccines, leading to persistently lower vaccination rates overall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking not just over time but across geographical areas, some localities have lower vaccination rates than others, and a major determinant of this is state or school rules about vaccine exemptions. States that allow religious or, especially, personal exemptions from school-based vaccine mandates &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/5/6/ofy130/5032316"&gt;tend to have lower vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see this very starkly in 2016 in California. Prior to 2016, California allowed many vaccine exemptions, including a personal belief exemption. As a result, a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/upshot/measles-vaccination-california-students.html"&gt;third of children lived in counties&lt;/a&gt; with measles vaccination rates below 90 percent. After a 2014 measles outbreak, the state tightened the rules considerably, and the California State Legislature passed a &lt;a href="https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/bills/ca_201520160sb277"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 that prohibited parents from claiming exemptions from vaccinations based on philosophical or religious beliefs. Exemptions were granted only for medical reasons. In the first year after that law took effect (the 2016-2017 school year), less than 1 percent of children lived in counties with vaccination rates below 90 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all to say: The current situation, both the decline in vaccinations and the geographic variations of those rates, is likely not a result of RFK Jr.’s recent moves in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-do-we-go-from-here"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do we go from here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the recent trends, we might expect continued small declines in vaccination rates. There are at least three reasons, however, to be concerned about more dramatic changes given the current leadership in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, Kennedy has brought vaccine skepticism into the mainstream of news and culture, and reinforced even more casual concerns about vaccines that some parents have. In my own discussions with parents, I’m seeing much more vaccine hesitancy and many more questions than I once did. &lt;em&gt;Is there really a reason to get the hepatitis B vaccination at birth? My sister-in-law says we should space out all of our vaccines – is that better? My husband is worried about vaccines and autism. What can I tell him? &lt;/em&gt;Pediatricians I speak to have also told me they are spending more time with parents discussing vaccination choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current kindergarten vaccination rates are a lagging indicator; we may see new parents in the next year or two vaccinate their children at much lower rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the administration may push states to make vaccine exemption policies looser, encouraging more states to allow for personal belief exemptions and reversing trends toward higher vaccination rates like California experienced. Based on what we know from the data, this is likely to lower vaccination rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, Kennedy has made some moves that could lead to changes in insurance coverage for vaccines or even approvals. Smart people, such as &lt;a href="https://pauloffit.substack.com/p/rfk-jrs-plan-to-eliminate-vaccines"&gt;Dr. Paul Offit&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician and &lt;a href="https://www.sabin.org/resources/the-rising-threat-of-measles-vaccine-hesitancy-and-public-health-qa-with-sabin-gold-medal-winner-dr-paul-offit/"&gt;leading authority on vaccinations&lt;/a&gt; and infectious diseases, have argued that Kennedy’s long-term goal may be the elimination of childhood vaccines. This feels unlikely given that the American Academy of Pediatrics has maintained its existing vaccine schedule, and most Americans still do want to vaccinate their children. Still, it seems like a legitimate concern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the fact that current vaccination rates are lower than they were in 2019-20 is not something this administration has engineered. But the rhetoric from some officials and some of &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.com/article/rfk-vaccine-advisory-panel-new-members/"&gt;Kennedy’s moves&lt;/a&gt; pertaining to vaccines have created the possibility that in the future, the changes will be even more extreme and damaging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-should-you-have-that-playdate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So … should you have that playdate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the good news, at least for parents of school-aged children: If your child has been vaccinated, they are extremely well protected against illness. The measles vaccine is 99 percent effective after two doses. So while I would never encourage you to seek out exposure to measles, if your child happens to be exposed, they are protected. The same can be said for other vaccines (DTAP, chicken pox, etc). If you’ve got a fully vaccinated kid, feel free to make whatever playdates your child would like, regardless of whether a potential playmate’s family has a different take on vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;

But these days, you're likely wishing you had taken her advice. Turns out, poor posture is one of the leading causes of back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/medical-services/spine/patient-resources/ergonomics-prolonged-sitting" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;UCLA Health&lt;/a&gt;, "Poor sitting posture and workplace ergonomics over time can damage spinal structures and contribute to recurrent episodes of neck or back pain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about all the hours spent hunched over laptops, desktops and smartphones — it adds up. Maintaining good posture in these situations isn't easy, and over time it can lead to muscle imbalances, disk compression and even nerve irritation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce the strain on your back, &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/guidetogoodposture.html" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;MedlinePlus&lt;/a&gt; recommends changing positions frequently, taking regular breaks, keeping your feet flat on the floor when seated and using proper back support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Teeradej - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Muscle strains and sprains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you tweaked your back lifting a heavy box or pushed yourself a little too hard at the gym, muscle-related injuries are another major cause of back pain. A sudden awkward movement, poor lifting technique or even overuse can strain the muscles, tendons or ligaments in your back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10265-back-strains-and-sprains" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, symptoms of a muscle strain or sprain include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain that gets worse with movement&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sudden muscle cramping or spasms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decreased range of motion or difficulty walking, bending or standing straight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bulging or herniated disks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between each vertebra in your spine are soft disks that act as cushions. But when one of those disks bulges or herniates, pain is often not far behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When a disk herniates, some of the cushioning material slips out of the casing that holds it. This is also called a ruptured disk or slipped disk," Shawna Seed writes for &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/treatments-for-herniated-disk" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When that cushioning presses on nearby nerves, it can cause pain, numbness or weakness. Most herniated disks occur in the lower back, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/herniated-disk/symptoms-causes/syc-20354095" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, but they can also happen in the neck — depending on which part of the spine is affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, herniated disks cause no symptoms, so you may not even know you have one without proper &lt;a href="https://www.taylormedmri.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;imaging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Arthritis and degenerative conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all back pain is your fault — sometimes it's just part of getting older. As you age, the disks and joints in your spine naturally start to wear down, which can lead to chronic issues like osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis or other degenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/spinal-arthritis" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Johns Hopkins Medicine&lt;/a&gt; explains that as the cartilage between the joints breaks down over time, it causes inflammation and pain. Since this kind of pain comes from physical wear and tear, it tends to flare up when you bend or twist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you've had a back injury in the past, that can raise your chances of developing degenerative arthritis later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back pain isn't always caused by a physical injury. In many cases, stress plays a bigger role than people realize. As Traci Pedersen writes for &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/stress/can-stress-cause-back-pain#symptoms" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt;, "Stress can lead to inflammation, muscle spasms, and tension in your back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with those physical reactions, stress can also reduce blood flow to your back muscles, heighten your sensitivity to pain and lead to poor posture — all of which can make back pain worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Regular exercise, stretching, and good posture can help alleviate back pain, while stress management techniques like meditation and deep breathing can help reduce stress levels," Pedersen adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How an MRI can help you find relief for your back pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter the cause of your back pain, the key to relief is getting an accurate diagnosis — and advanced imaging can help you pinpoint the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) provides a clear, detailed picture of your spine, muscles, disks and nerves. It can help identify the exact cause of your pain and guide your treatment plan — whether that's physical therapy, chiropractic care or surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, waiting for insurance to cover your MRI means waiting for that pain relief. Referrals, long waits and high deductibles can all be obstacles standing in your way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why more people are turning to TaylorMed MRI, Utah's go-to provider for fast, affordable and insurance-free MRI scans.
