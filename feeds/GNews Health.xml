The test detects memory problems by analysing the brain’s automatic responses to images the person sees before the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This shows us that our new passive measure of memory, which we’ve built specifically for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, can be sensitive to those individuals at very high risk but who are not yet diagnosed,” said Dr George Stothart, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Bath, where the test was developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The trial, run with the University of Bristol, involved 54 healthy adults and 52 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). People with MCI have problems with memory, thinking or language, but these are not usually severe enough to prevent them doing their daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Before the test, volunteers were shown eight images and told to name them, but not specifically to remember them or look out for them in the test. The researchers then recorded the participants’ brain activity as they watched hundreds of images flash up on a screen. Each image appeared for a third of a second and every fifth picture was one of the eight they had seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c94264b9-b7a6-4f78-a3b3-bd50aa5dcdf9" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Dr George Stothart from the University of Bath with John Stennard, one of the 54 healthy adults involved in the trial.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: BRACE Dementia Research&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The scientists found that those with amnestic MCI, which largely affects a person’s memory for objects, had reduced responses to the test compared with healthy adults and those with non-amnestic MCI. People with amnestic MCI are many times more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than those with non-amnestic MCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The test cannot identify who will definitely develop Alzheimer’s disease. But if larger studies confirm the findings, it could help doctors assess early on which patients are at high risk and could benefit most from new Alzheimer’s drugs such as donanemab and lecanemab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All of the tests were performed in people’s homes, which Stothart said was important for making them accessible and reducing people’s anxiety. Details are published in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/braincomms/fcaf279" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Vladimir Litvak, of UCL’s Queen Square Institute of Neurology, said it was “an early step towards developing a clinically useful test”. A crucial next step, he said, would be to determine whether it can predict how a person’s condition changes over time and inform decisions about their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Julia Dudley, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “It’s encouraging to see studies exploring potential ways to detect memory problems earlier. New Alzheimer’s treatments are proving to be more effective when given at earlier stages in the disease, therefore earlier diagnosis is key for people to benefit from this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Longer-term studies in larger, diverse groups of people are needed to find out if this technology can predict how memory problems will unfold over time. Memory impairment can also be linked to other health conditions, not just dementia. Future research should look at how other factors may influence brainwave test results and explore how these tests could work alongside other diagnosis tools like cognitive assessments and blood tests.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 23:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxQVHpoemJ1SGxEUGZzaHRSdU5JS3kzaU54UkVlZEhpVGZhTjVNZ2VKZ0pvN2VDNG5uNFpCRDJlR3ZZTi1ZRjBuTVkzMk9MM1JqU1BCR29uNllaXzFTcWt3VW55UFBXVEVKQ1p0NUFXSVBjeXM4a2k3Uy1mckNxWWZObUc2bGhRZFI4Sm8yZU1GTi1xQlVXR3QtNFZLV2tCanVFU1ZjRWtJc0tsUS1aU3d6bUptQXVVblVZQUpzMVcwMHRtWUR1ek1lTA</guid></item><item><title>诊断软件使中风患者的完全康复率提高三倍-泰晤士报</title><link>https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/diagnostic-software-stroke-patients-ai-hghmzxs0s</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__ArticleContent-sc-15gvuj2-8 kuowVf"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Half of stroke patients can now “fully recover” after the NHS introduced “revolutionary” software that allows patients to receive a diagnosis up to one hour faster compared with traditional methods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Analysis from NHS England has found that the specialised AI-assisted tool has been used to interpret the brain scans of more than 60,000 patients since the roll-out last summer, as half of stroke patients now receive a diagnosis from the software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The service, available in 100 &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/topic/nhs" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; stroke clinics, allows for rapid processing and interpretation of brain scans, which helps doctors to make faster decisions about treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3"&gt;&lt;div id="6afd3834-a856-4c97-81b9-b9b611780b88"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;A stroke occurs when blood supply to part of the brain is cut off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The improved scans mean that patients can now get a diagnosis up to an hour faster than when they are diagnosed with traditional methods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;During a stroke, the&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; blood supply to parts of the brain is blocked or reduced, causing the brain cells to die.

This holds huge promise for enhancing brain health and memory in our aging population.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team believes the prebiotic harnessed the gut-brain axis and promoted the growth of good bacteria in the intestines that reduced inflammation in the brain and improved cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14607151/scientists-debunked-theory-cause-autism-study.html"&gt;'gut-brain axis',&lt;/a&gt; a network linking the digestive tract and the nervous system and brain, has been thought to be a key link between digestion and mental health for years, with some scientists claiming that the trillions of microbes in the intestines may influence mood, behavior and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Conducting the study in twins reduced the chances the changes observed were because of genetics, but the study was small, and scientists said it needs to be repeated in a larger group in order to support its findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A study has found that two common supplements could help prevent dementia (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors at the Cleveland Clinic say the gut-brain axis explains everyday sensations such as 'gut feelings' or 'butterflies' in the stomach, and others suggest a balanced microbiome, or community of bacteria in the intestines, can boost brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are even suggestions an unbalanced microbiome in the gut could be linked to a higher risk of autism in children, and a higher risk of depression, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet many experts caution that much of the research up to this point remains preliminary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46116-y"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, scientists gave all participants the protein powder BCAA, sold for about 70 cents a capsule and a common supplement used to boost muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Half of the participants also received the prebiotic inulin, a type of fiber from roots, plus fructooligosaccharides, a type of carbohydrate found in plants and sometimes used as a low-calorie sweetener. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prebiotic supplements are readily available online and in retailers and cost about $3 a pill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Twins who received both the powder and prebiotic scored better on Paired Associates Learning (PAL) tests, or tests that involve matching similar images used to help recognize early signs of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests on stool samples revealed twins who received the prebiotic had higher levels of Bifidobacterium in their gut compared to those not taking the supplement.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bifidobacterium are healthy bacteria shown to boost the body's immune system, improve digestion and even potentially help those struggling with depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote in their study: 'Our results demonstrate that cheap and readily available gut microbiome interventions may improve cognition in our ageing population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'To confirm our findings, a larger study which includes a range of cognitive tests, alongside measures of effect and attention, and detailed microbiome measures is warranted.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said their findings would only apply to healthy adults and not to those who had already developed dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors at Johns Hopkins say that there is a 'second brain' in the gut, or the enteric nervous system, formed of two thin layers of more than 100million nerve cells that line the gastrointestinal tract from the throat to the rectum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cells do not 'think' like in the brain, primarily being involved in digestion and the release of enzymes to break down food, but there is evidence that they send signals back to the brain that can trigger shifts in mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies have already linked this to shifts in mood in those with irritable bowel disease, a chronic bowel pain disorder, and caused by constipation or diarrhea.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating condition that gradually robs sufferers of their abilities to take care of themselves, speak and remember events and people in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The number of Americans suffering from the condition is expected to surge, according to some estimates, and jump to almost 13million by 2050, nearly double today's patient figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warning signs of the disease include forgetting names or familiar objects, becoming lost in familiar places or unexplained changes in emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure for the condition, but scientists have developed medications that may be able to slow the progression of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cause of Alzheimer's is not clear, but studies suggest it may be linked to a build-up of proteins in the brain, or to damage to blood vessels in the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As part of the study, researchers also investigated whether the supplements influenced muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some scientists suggest that the regulation of muscle growth may be controlled by key signals from the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All participants were asked to also complete a weight-lifting session twice per week, and do exercises including squats, calf raises and bicep curls.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed no difference in muscle mass or chair rise times, the time it takes someone to get up from a chair, at the end of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers suggested this may have been because the study was too short to show any shifts in muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Despite the new technology, the way to treat patients has remained largely the same, with doctors using stethoscopes hanging around their necks to access the internal organs of their patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-3" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nifty item that has been a part of a doctor's toolkit since 1816 has now received an AI-powered upgrade.

Meanwhile, it can also perform a quick ECG (electrocardiogram) at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-5" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new device, which is the size of a playing card, has been showcased by researchers at Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust as part of a study in the UK called TRICORDER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-6" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device can also connect via Bluetooth to a dedicated smartphone app where the captured data can be visualized. Meanwhile, it uses cellular or Wi-Fi connectivity to access cloud-based AI algorithms to work its magic.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;'Antibiotics are great, they are miracles in severe bacterial infections where they can be life-saving,' Dr. Van Groningen explained (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We also know that antibiotic use is the number one factor for developing C.diff, or C. difficile infections, which can be absolutely terrible if you have seen or heard or read about these,' she shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;C. diff is a type of bacteria that infects your colon, per &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15548-c-diff-infection"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, and is extremely contagious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr. Van Groningen said that even if you don't develop C.diff from antibiotic use, it can heavily interfere with your gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In fact, there are a couple of recent studies that have shown that antibiotic use has been associated with a modest &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-7377039/Some-antibiotics-linked-higher-risk-colon-cancer.html"&gt;increased risk of colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;,' Dr. Van Groningen said in the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is postulated that one of the possible causative explanations for this could be the alteration in gut microbiome that comes along with antibiotic use,' she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Again, great drug for the right purpose, but I wouldn't use it just because.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The next thing that the internist tries to avoid is the frequent use of Benadryl, an over-the-counter medication that's used primarily to treat allergies and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Another great example of a fantastic medication used in the acute setting for an allergic reaction, a rash, can be fantastic, but it is not meant to be used in the long term,' she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The next thing that the internist tries to avoid is the frequent use of Benadryl, an over-the-counter medication that's used primarily to treat allergies and inflammation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Finally, she revealed that she would 'never trade sleep for productivity' - meaning that sleep is absolutely essential for our health and well-being (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She cited that there have been a few studies that found a link between long-term &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14918501/benadryl-crippling-disease-warning.html"&gt;Benadryl use and dementia.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Plus, the long list of side effects, especially in older adults, can be quite burdensome,' she warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the side effects that the doctor named were sedation, constipation, and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's just not great as a long-term option,' she maintained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, she revealed that she would 'never trade sleep for productivity' - meaning that sleep is absolutely essential for our health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is not something that I think we should be doing when we have time, it is the cornerstone of our health,' she stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-9491791/Lack-SLEEP-increase-risk-dementia-study-finds.html"&gt;so many different studies&lt;/a&gt; that link chronic sleep deprivation with an increased risk of a multitude of chronic diseases, everything from dementia to cardiovascular disease,' the doctor shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said that on a long-term basis, it's important to maintain a healthy sleep schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 17:05:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQNmdTdmp3VkhEX1hVQnZ6OVZ5NUFfQzY1YURrQnRLQlY2VndXdEZDOEZJSUhfek4tcE1rUkNHSFFLb1BkZ0ZUQkY2Y1VZX2ZXbUk4MGRpZ2dBaExQODd1MnBLNEZiRUdsb0FncTNuQjNiMk9Ha0I2RXF1Wk9lRDI1UGZqeWRlSTRqM0V2c0VxaUlEUDN3Wng1RtIBngFBVV95cUxOMUd0eldDeUtaZHoxMEEzZy1oZXc4TTc2THMzY2Z2QjRQQU56QkVkb2UwcFFSamZQTXBnUWlSeDlNeXkycFlOQ1p6cmxRWkRlN1hzci1fNlVOajctR3hzbXM5U3piZDJUbDNNYkZJTG1YVmFtM2VPZUdTNjNPQUJfYXdkMkhSNUU0czNDX0pfLUszMExveXdkN3k4dDcwQQ</guid></item><item><title>学生重返校园时对纽约疫苗的了解- Gothamist</title><link>https://gothamist.com/news/what-to-know-about-vaccines-in-ny-as-students-go-back-to-school</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="60381"&gt;Back-to-school checklists for many parents include backpacks, notebooks — and making sure their kids are up to date on their vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="44ubo"&gt;Even amid &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/11/vaccines-measles-rfk-jr-health/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;mixed messaging&lt;/a&gt;

Students arriving from outside of the state or country can be given grace periods of up to 30 days, according to &lt;a href="https://infohub.nyced.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/guidance-to-schools-on-immunization-compliance.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;guidance to schools&lt;/a&gt; from the New York City Department of Education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6hgg6"&gt;“Vaccination is an important part of keeping our schools healthy, and vaccination guidance has been distributed to families," said Jenna Lyle, a spokesperson for the city education department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5gk4q"&gt;New York state has &lt;a href="https://www.ncsl.org/health/state-non-medical-exemptions-from-school-immunization-requirements" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;among the strictest&lt;/a&gt; school vaccination laws in the country, since former Gov. Andrew Cuomo eliminated the option of religious exemptions for vaccination in 2019 following a major measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="45gmm"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do New York kindergartners compare to the rest of the country on vaccine coverage?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7t8c0"&gt;During the last school year, vaccine coverage among kindergartners &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;decreased nationally&lt;/a&gt; for all vaccines tracked by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At the same time, the agency found that the share of kindergartners claiming exemptions increased in most states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7e4ub"&gt;However, the data shows New York’s vaccine coverage remained among the strongest in the country, largely because kindergartners were not taking advantage of vaccine exemptions at the rates they were in many other states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3hr36"&gt;In New York, 97.8% of kindergartners received the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, above the 95% threshold needed for herd immunity. Statewide, 0.3% of kindergartners claimed any vaccine exemption last school year, up from 0.1% the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="9ns8r"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What about vaccination rates among younger kids?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="d8bmo"&gt;City data on vaccine coverage among 2-year-olds shows rates have been &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-sets/childhood-vaccination-data.page" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;trending upward&lt;/a&gt; in recent years for most types of shots, although uptake for some vaccines is better than others — and rates can vary widely by neighborhood. Citywide, 95% of 2-year-olds had gotten at least one dose of their measles, mumps and rubella vaccines last year, up from 87% in 2020. But in parts of the city, the rate remains low. In the Central Harlem ZIP code 10039, just 58% of 2-year-olds got at least one dose of the MMR vaccine last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="9pl9t"&gt;Chantal Gomez, a spokesperson for the city health department, said routine medical care was disrupted during the pandemic, negatively affecting vaccination rates, and the increase in overall vaccination rates among young children indicates a reversal of that trend. She said the city is also working to share and discuss vaccination rates with individual health care providers to improve coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="cn9sf"&gt;Citywide, vaccination against the flu has declined among all children under 18 in recent years, city data shows. The flu vaccine is &lt;a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-life/health-and-wellness/immunizations" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;only required&lt;/a&gt; in the city for children attending pre-K or day care, according to guidance from the city Department of Education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="c9knl"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Could federal policy changes influence New York’s school vaccine requirements?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="cklhb"&gt;Federal public health changes have stirred up some uncertainty about the future. New York state bases its school vaccine requirements on recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="f20oh"&gt;Kennedy’s recent overhaul of the committee has prompted concerns about whether members will continue to base their recommendations in science, and some professional medical groups &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/22/health/covid-vaccine-pregnancy-acog-recommendations" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;have started issuing&lt;/a&gt; their own recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="aeiv3"&gt;“Should changes to ACIP’s composition lead to substantial shifts in its recommendations, the department will carefully evaluate those changes and assess any implications for public health policy in New York,” Dr. James McDonald, the state health commissioner, told Gothamist in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ar9gr"&gt;Danielle DeSouza, a spokesperson for the state health department, said last week the agency continues to monitor federal vaccine messaging and recommendations and “do what is best to protect public health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="42e6s"&gt;Sessions said pediatricians are “really following American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations right now, and we're looking to them as sort of our guiding light.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ckfo6"&gt;But health care providers say challenges could arise if future changes in vaccine recommendations affect which shots are covered by insurance or provided to doctors by the federal Vaccines for Children Program, which provides vaccines at no cost to eligible kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="19ktj"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will flu shots be available as usual this year?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="4h1fn"&gt;ACIP raised some eyebrows among medical groups when it &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/cdc-vaccine-advisory-committee-recommends-flu-vaccines-thimerosal/story?id=123224218" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;advised against&lt;/a&gt; formulations of the flu vaccine that contain a preservative known as thimerosal in June. But doctors who spoke to Gothamist said they didn’t anticipate any challenge getting flu shots without the preservative and said it wouldn’t lead to any meaningful change for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="62vti"&gt;Some health care providers in New York are already starting to get in their supply of this year’s flu vaccine, while others expect the vaccine to come in soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 16:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxNbDhIUzNfZ01BcGVQd3BQR01kTTQtUm9HOFljcXRla3JDV2JGRENPNXRXVVQyT2RWZ3c0RGx6NXRRM25rcnB4Umh2NkZ6QmZtamdJRWpkaE9UeDdKc3E5Rnp5V2NyYnVHTW54bVRYSG1BTE1EcE14TkxmZU5jT29lMUNVVTNaX2dpcXBJZUx4UEg4cEJF</guid></item><item><title>医生说，电子烟可能会对儿童健康造成不可逆转的伤害-《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/01/vaping-may-be-causing-irreversible-harm-children-health-doctors</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Doctors have raised the alarm about high levels of vaping among children worldwide, saying they are convinced e-cigarettes are causing irreversible harm to their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cardiologists, researchers and health experts said they were “extremely concerned” about the harmful effects of e-cigarettes on millions of teenagers and young people, including exposure to toxins and carcinogens – some of which are still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;contentType&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Article&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sectionId&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;society&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;tags&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;society/e-cigarettes&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Keyword&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Vaping&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;society/smoking&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Keyword&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Smoking&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;society/childrens-health&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Keyword&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Children's health&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;society/health&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Keyword&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Health&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;society/society&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Keyword&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Society&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;world/world&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Keyword&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;World news&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;type/article&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Type&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Article&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;tone/news&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Tone&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;News&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;profile/andrew-gregory&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Contributor&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Andrew Gregory&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-home-news&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Tracking&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;UK Home News&amp;quot;}],&amp;quot;isPaidContent&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;isPreview&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;host&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theguardian.com&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;pageId&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;society/2025/sep/01/vaping-may-be-causing-irreversible-harm-children-health-doctors&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;idUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://profile.theguardian.com&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;contributionsServiceUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://contributions.guardianapis.com&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;editionId&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;US&amp;quot;}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nicotine levels in e-cigarettes can be very high, raising the risk of addiction and injury to the developing brains of adolescents. Children are also risking long-term cardiovascular effects as a result of vaping at school and college, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Speaking at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) annual congress in Madrid, the world’s largest heart conference, Prof Maja-Lisa Løchen, a senior cardiologist at the University hospital of North Norway, said she was concerned that millions of children could face ill health in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She said: “I worry that vaping may be causing irreversible harm to children’s brains and hearts. Of course we have to wait for long-term data, but I am concerned. It increases your blood pressure, your heart rate, and we know that the arteries become more stiff.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vaping stresses children’s cardiovascular systems, Løchen said. Their heart rate rises and their blood vessels constrict, which can stiffen arteries in the heart over time. Repeatedly vaping can lead to high blood pressure, which in turn increases the risk of developing an irregular heart rhythm, stroke and even a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Løchen cited a study published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine that suggested vaping increases the risk of stroke by almost a third (32%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When e-cigarettes heat liquids to higher temperatures, they can also release larger amounts of harmful chemicals that can flow into the lungs, enter the bloodstream and seep into the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The liquids in e-cigarettes can release known carcinogens such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde when heated, research suggests. These and other chemicals can damage blood vessels, drive inflammation and contribute to cardiovascular disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There is an additional risk of vaping in children [compared with adults] when it comes to effects on the body,” Løchen said. “Because we know that the nicotine and other elements in e-cigarettes have a very harmful effect on developing brains. Not only in the foetus, but during childhood and into your 20s. So that is something we are extremely concerned about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When children quit vaping, some experience nicotine withdrawal that can increase heart rate and blood pressure, Løchen told reporters after she gave a presentation on e-cigarettes in Madrid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We also know that when children and young people start vaping, they may become dependent on the nicotine and it can become a gateway to smoking. I’m very worried – and convinced – that children and adolescents that are starting to vape now are at increased risk of irreversible harm to their health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Also speaking in Madrid, Prof Susanna Price, a consultant cardiologist at Royal Brompton hospital in London and the chair of the ESC advocacy committee, said: “We are seeing an increase in children vaping but what we don’t yet know is what that translates to in long-term cardiovascular risk because they haven’t been around long enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I think there is a push to suggest that vaping is safe but we don’t know that. It’s my concern that we’re going to replace one highly addictive substance with another one that may have a similar profile with respect to cardiovascular risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Charmaine Griffiths, the chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said: “Vaping is not risk-free and no child or teenager should be picking up an e-cigarette.” She said governments must take action to tackle concerning levels of youth vaping. “Making vaping less appealing to young people and creating a smoke-free generation cannot come a moment too soon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Data on the long-term health effects is limited because vapes are relatively new and evolving. It could be years before further effects become apparent. In the meantime, Løchen is in favour of a global ban on sales of e-cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I think based on what we know now about the detrimental and harmful effects of e-cigarettes, I think there should be a ban on sales of e-cigarettes worldwide,” she said. “There have been around for 15, 20 years now, we have the data. We know they are not harmless.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 16:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxQR09udWVWT005WUJ1NUw2VmVTeU5RNnpCV0FUM2Rvb1JNb01rd2lrLWtCSDFSVDU5M1Rac3JMX0FGb0NBUDBCV3dBcl9VVDlZU3MtV1hYZ2l0OXNCa21yYkNOS0lQd0pPQ1dYelNNOUZCR2hDb1pHOW5DeHJIUE5fU3dja0tITmdsZHNacEhRVTdJXzl3M19zYVJ5VlZhZkVRYWFIOEJ4X2txczFuZjlZaA</guid></item><item><title>可以偷走阿司匹林冠冕的预防心脏病发作的药物-泰晤士报</title><link>https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/the-heart-attack-preventing-drug-that-could-steal-aspirins-crown-fwxsbkrb7</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Aspirin has been one of the most widely used medicines around the world for more than a century, most recently in low-dose form as a treatment for cardiovascular problems such as a heart attack or a stroke. However, its reign has been challenged by more recent drugs, and new research published in The Lancet could see it &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/asperin-clopidogrel-heart-disease-bbzffpzt5" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;lose its crown to a younger pretender&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Researchers analysing clinical trials involving nearly 30,000 people with coronary artery disease — which can include those who’ve had a heart attack or suffer from angina — found that a low dose of aspirin doesn’t offer as much protection as the newer antiplatelet (blood-thinning) drug clopidogrel. A finding that could change UK guidelines which, at least for most people with&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; coronary artery disease, advocate taking a daily aspirin for the rest of their lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Clopidogrel may be the newer of the two drugs but it has been in use since the late Nineties and is the medicine of choice for preventing recurrent problems in most people who have had a stroke, or who have “furred-up” arteries in their legs. However, aspirin remains the standard long-term preventive for people with coronary artery disease. For now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more expert advice on healthy living, fitness and wellbeing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Both medicines work by reducing the stickiness of platelets, the smallest components of blood that clump together after injury to help to form clots and stem bleeding. A potentially life-saving physiological response if you are involved in a road traffic accident or undergoing surgery, but a potentially fatal one if the platelets happen to be activated in a narrow blood vessel supplying your heart or brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The use of antiplatelet medicines took off in the UK after the publication in 1988 of the landmark ISIS-2 trial, which found that daily low-dose aspirin was a life-saver for people who had a heart attack. It indicated that one month of taking the drug prevented 25 deaths, and another 10-15 non-fatal heart attacks or strokes, for every 1,000 people. And the longer they took the aspirin the greater the benefit. It was game-changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Clopidogrel was licensed about a decade after the ISIS-2 trial and was initially mainly used as a substitute for people who couldn’t take aspirin. It has a different mechanism of action (see below) but the net effect — reduced platelet “stickiness” — is much the same. Indeed, these days the drugs are often used together, at least in the short to medium term, after a heart attack, coronary artery bypass surgery, stenting and heart valve surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, as well as preventing unwanted clots in arterial bottlenecks the drugs can prevent useful clots and lead to troublesome bleeding: anything from bruising after a trivial knock or shaving nicks that won’t stop oozing to life-threatening haemorrhage in some cases. Reassuringly the Lancet paper shows that while clopidogrel is better than aspirin at preventing heart attacks (and strokes) in most people with coronary artery disease, it carries no extra risk of these types of dangerous bleeding. It is often the preferred option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/asperin-clopidogrel-heart-disease-bbzffpzt5" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Switching aspirin for alternative drug ‘reduces risk of heart attack’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If, as expected, guidance is changed to favour clopidogrel, millions more will end up on the drug (more than a third of people over 65 in the UK take a daily low-dose aspirin at present), but there are a couple of flies in the ointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;First, a person’s response to clopidogrel can be affected by their genetic make up, with about 30 per cent of those with European ancestry (and 50 per cent of those with east Asian ancestry) having genes that render the drug less effective. However, the researchers behind the Lancet study concluded that while it may reduce efficacy in acute treatment, such as in the days or weeks after developing heart problems, there is less evidence that it significantly impairs longer-term prevention for most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Second, the commonly prescribed anti-stomach acid medication omeprazole, and its sister drug esomeprazole, can reduce clopidogrel’s efficacy. The latest evidence suggests this may not be as worrying as initially thought, but the combination is still best avoided. Lansoprazole, another popular member of the same family of acid-suppressing drugs, is deemed a safer choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Unlike aspirin, clopidogrel is prescription-only, so people will not be able to self-medicate. Fewer people self-treat with daily low-dose aspirin than used to, but I still come across healthy middle-aged people who buy it over the counter to ward off an early heart attack or stroke. However, the evidence is clear: if you are not at higher than normal risk of stroke or heart attack, the risks of aspirin (mainly bleeding) are likely to outweigh the benefits. Take an antiplatelet medicine only if advised to do so by your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Oh, and it is clo-pid-o-grill. At least that’s how I pronounce it…&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Visit &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/mi-secondary-prevention/" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;cks.nice.org.uk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; for more information on how people who have already had one can prevent further heart attacks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;How aspirin and clopidogrel work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Aspirin irreversibly blocks an enzyme in platelets that encourages them to clump and stick together (a natural part of the clotting process). This effect lasts for the whole seven to ten-day life of the platelets and wanes only when they are replaced by new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Clopidogrel binds to a receptor on the surface of platelets (called P2Y12 adenosine diphosphate) but the result is much the same.

who looked at data of over 180,000 participants broke down the worst food additives into five categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This included flavouring, flavour enhancers, colour agents, sweeteners and varieties of sugars—which are all found in ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they went further to identify 12 specific markers of ultra-processed (MUPs) foods that were found to significantly increase risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These included the flavour enhancers glutamate and ribonucleotides, as well as the sweeteners acesulfame, saccharin and sucralose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also included processing aids like caking agents, firming agents, gelling agents and thickeners as well as the sugars fructose, inverted sugar, lactose and maltodextrin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, gelling agents like gelatine was significantly linked to mortality but inversely—lowering risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A major study has identified the additives in ultraprocessed food most linked to an early death&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found modified oil, protein source, and fibre had no significant association with risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the journal eClinicalMedicine, they wrote: 'To the best of our knowledge, no prior study has assessed associations of such a broad range of MUP categories and specific MUPs with all-cause mortality.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers used data from the UK Bio-bank, which tracked adults between 2006 and 2010. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age of participants was 57, and 57 percent of the cohort were female and 43 per cent male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found on average a fifth of participants' food intake was made up of UPF—food that contains more than one ingredient you rarely find in a domestic kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When they followed up with them after 11 years, the found 10,203 participants had since died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their analysis revealed that as UPF intake rose above 18 per cent, the risk of dying increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the authors cautioned that consumption data in the study was self-reported and not independently verified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;These ultra-processed food markers can often be found in breads, biscuits, crisps and cakes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nevertheless, previous studies have linked UPFs to obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers and an early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And just last month, research eating too many UPFs could be stopping you from losing weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;British scientists who tracked dozens of adults found those who avoided UPFs, lost twice as much weight as those who often consumed them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sticking to meals cooked from scratch could also help curb food cravings, but UPFs had little impact on blood pressure, heart rate, liver function and cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They argued their findings echoed calls to limit certain types of UPFs but cautioned it also showed not all UPFs are 'inherently unhealthy'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Samuel Dicken, from University College London, study co-author, said: 'We saw significantly greater weight loss on the minimally processed food diet.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-ef5a3e00-8744-11f0-b943-7310ff2ac219" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15054609/Longevity-experts-food-additives-worst-health.html"&gt;

Specifically, children with higher levels of Aggressiveness, Neuroticism, and Negative Valence tended to have more severe ADHD symptoms, while children with higher levels of Conscientiousness tended to have fewer symptoms. The research was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1027/1614-0001/a000437"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Individual Differences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that interfere with daily functioning. It typically begins in childhood, though symptoms often continue into adolescence and adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact causes are not fully understood, but research suggests a strong genetic component, with heritability estimates of around 70–80%. Environmental influences, such as prenatal exposure to alcohol, nicotine, or stress, can also increase risk. Early childhood factors like low birth weight or lead exposure may contribute to its development. Without recognition, ADHD can lead to academic underachievement, strained relationships, and emotional difficulties. With support, many individuals learn strategies to manage symptoms effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Tatjana Krstić and her colleagues sought to evaluate the relationships between personality traits and the severity of ADHD symptoms in middle school children. In particular, they wanted to see whether personality traits are linked to specific ADHD symptoms such as inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 402 parents of children aged 10 to 15 years, with an average child age of 13. About 51% of the children were boys. Parents ranged in age from 29 to 63, with an average age of 43. Children were recruited from six schools in Serbia located in both urban and rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents rated their children’s ADHD symptom severity and personality traits. For ADHD symptoms, the researchers used the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale – version IV (SNAP-IV), which includes items such as “Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly.” To assess personality, they used the parent version of the Big Five Plus Two for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The personality assessment measured the five widely studied personality traits—Neuroticism (e.g., “Often has the jitters”), Extraversion (e.g., “Has many friends”), Aggressiveness (e.g., “Often yells at others when provoked”), Conscientiousness (e.g., “Always fulfills his/her obligations”), and Openness (e.g., “Likes new and interesting things”). It also included two additional traits: Positive Valence (e.g., “Has a big influence in a peer group”) and Negative Valence (e.g., “Thinks that he/she is no good”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results indicated that children with more severe ADHD symptoms tended to show higher levels of Aggressiveness, Neuroticism, and Negative Valence. They tended to score lower on Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Openness. The severity of ADHD symptoms was not associated with Positive Valence. When the researchers examined the unique contributions of personality traits in predicting ADHD severity, the association with Extraversion was no longer significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings supported the conclusion that personality traits in children are predictors of ADHD symptoms,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study contributes to the scientific knowledge about the links between personality and ADHD. However, it should be noted that all the data in this study came from parents, leaving room for reporting bias and common method bias to have affected the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1027/1614-0001/a000437"&gt;The Relationship Between Personality Traits and ADHD Symptoms in 10- to 15-Year-Old Children: Parent Ratings,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Tatjana Krstić, Ilija Milovanović, Aleksandra Stojadinović, Vojislava Bugarski Ignjatović, and Željka Nikolašević.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 14:19:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxQWVRsRHNmN0JYUDdMb092dkFlREpfb1FzTlRCU01TalI4V21QVTFUUzY0cmRDS1RJOVRxeC16NnM4ZHFZbndBTlV1bThGTVhfSGYwc090RTFRcFZMVkYyNktRRGtQdWh6SVdHeVdrV3VqUE9KaGxndTlaTXV6aDAtNE15dF84MjBKU0FqNUt2YXlHbDYxTVEtUFNJaDExbHRfNk93TExSR0FKaGRQ</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，通过一项常见的健康干预措施降低了痴呆风险- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/dementia-risk-slashed-one-common-110048570.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addressing hearing loss early on may significantly reduce the risk of dementia, a recent study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/vision-and-hearing/hearing-loss" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:with hearing loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;with hearing loss&lt;/a&gt;

and 2.78 times more likely to have a co-occurring cognitive impairment, the expert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These co-occurring impairments may include memory loss, reduced problem-solving, reduced awareness of mistakes and slower rate of processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are signs that a person may be experiencing hearing loss and should see a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthcare professional;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthcare professional&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Generally, when we have trouble hearing in restaurants or in places with loud ambient noise, [it is a] good time to have our hearing checked," Devi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;When someone is not able to hear properly, the brain does not receive adequate information, an expert said.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another sign is when someone frequently asks individuals to repeat themselves during conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early intervention is important, according to Bossinas.

But Cuomo's observation adds that, once a person is sick, the body's needs might change and the goal shifts to fighting the disease and surviving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In patients fighting cancer or heart disease, body fat and cholesterol can serve as crucial energy reserves, helping the body withstand the immense metabolic stress of illness. Cholesterol is also a fundamental building block needed to repair cells damaged by disease or harsh treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while alcohol is a known carcinogen, moderate intake has been linked to better heart disease survival. It also appears to improve cholesterol levels, reduce blood clot formation and increase insulin sensitivity, which may benefit an already-diagnosed patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above is biomedical scientist Raphael E Cuomo. A counterintuitive medical finding, termed Cuomo's Paradox, reveals that factors like obesity or alcohol, which increase the risk of developing a disease, may actually be linked to living longer after a diagnosis is received&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cuomo described the paradox in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jn.nutrition.org/article/S0022-3166(25)00472-9/fulltext"&gt;The Journal for Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; and offered two possible explanations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First, it may be a false signal. A severe, advanced disease like cancer or heart failure causes the body to waste away, leading to weight loss and plummeting cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therefore, low weight and low cholesterol levels might not be the cause of poor survival. Instead, they are a symptom of the aggressive disease process that is already underway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors are not recommending that patients gain weight after a diagnosis, however. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The observation is that patients who are already overweight or obese at the time of their diagnosis often show better survival rates compared to normal-weight or underweight patients with the same disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The second possible explanation is that there may be real biological mechanisms at play. Body fat serves as a store of energy that the body can tap into to meet the demands of fighting their disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These energy reserves also help patients tolerate the side effects of treatments like chemotherapy and radiation and reduce the risk of becoming dangerously malnourished and weak, a condition called cachexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, high cholesterol is a clogging agent that increases a healthy person’s risk of developing heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Age-adjusted deaths per 100,000 people due to heart disease have been steadily declining since 1950. Death rates have plummeted from almost 600 per 100,000 in 1950 to around 160 per 100,000 deaths in 2018&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cancer diagnoses, particularly colorectal cancer, are likely to continue ticking up in part due to major disruptions to preventive healthcare during the Covid pandemic. Nearly 130,000 cancers were missed in 2020 and 2021, or nine percent less than the expected number&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in a patient who is already battling cancer or another chronic illness, fatty molecules in the blood, including cholesterol and lipids, are sources of energy for the body to tap into and use in its fight against advancing disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cholesterol is also a vital component of cell membranes. To heal damaged tissues resulting from disease, radiation, or chemotherapy, the body requires a sufficient amount of cholesterol to rebuild healthy cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also helps control the production and release of hormones like estrogen and cortisol, which regulate the body's response to illness, maintain muscle mass, and manage inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol is classified by the World Health Organization as a class 1 carcinogen, a substance that has been proven to cause cancer in humans based on sufficient evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Cuomo's Paradox reveals that for patients already diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, moderate alcohol consumption has been consistently linked to better survival in observational studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol can increase levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which helps remove ‘bad’ cholesterol from the arteries, slowing plaque buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moderate intake can also make the body more sensitive to insulin, reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes, a significant risk factor for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Factors like obesity, often linked to disease risk, are paradoxically associated with better survival outcomes in some patients after a diagnosis, suggesting nutritional needs shift once illness strikes (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol can also make blood platelets less ‘sticky,’ which reduces the formation of blood clots that can cause heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the paradox, the stress of withdrawal or the loss of a perceived benefit, such as antioxidants in red wine, could theoretically do more harm than good in heart disease patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This does not mean that being overweight, drinking or having high cholesterol is beneficial for someone without a disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It means that rigorously enforcing prevention guidelines in sick, weakened patients might be ineffective and could even undermine their strength and well-being. Each patient's care must be tailored to their individual needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nutritional guidance should also not be abandoned. Instead, it &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14996863/Not-ultra-processed-foods-bad-you-study-reveals-eight-actually-make-you-healthier.html"&gt;should be tailored&lt;/a&gt; to the specific stage of a patient's health journey, Cuomo said, rather than based on standard prevention advice, such as reducing cholesterol or losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cuomo &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://medschool.ucsd.edu/about/news/archive/2025/08-04-cuomo-paradox.html"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: ‘Healthy should be defined relative to a person’s stage in life and goals. Cuomo’s Paradox reframes health as prevention versus survival. My research has uncovered pre-diagnosis versus post-diagnosis as a core variable in nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It became clear to me that prevention advice and survivorship advice must be separated.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    Consult with your doctor before beginning any new fitness program.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmevvma4o000t28p1geng6fgh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When it comes to the discourse over longevity, the “bro scientists” are mostly leading the way.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s00053b6nvpfq0hla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s according to longevity specialist Dr. Vonda Wright, whose new book, “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0593736583?tag=randohouseinc7986-20" target="_blank"&gt;Unbreakable:&lt;/a&gt;  A Woman’s Guide to Aging With Power,” aims to level the playing field.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s00063b6ny73l9946@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have a gamut of people framing men living longer as longevity and a very hopeful message,” said Wright, an orthopedic surgeon and author based in Orlando. That is a positive thing, but “for generations, when you think of women living longer, the solution is anti-aging, as if there’s something wrong with us. There’s nothing wrong with us. We are aging in a different way than men.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s00073b6n0xob90in@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Women do &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/13/health/life-expectancy-gender-gap"&gt;live longer than men&lt;/a&gt;, on average. But Wright is focusing not just on living longer but also living better. And in her book, she addresses female longevity from the perspectives of women. She notes the role that shifting hormones play in this process and encourages women to work on disease prevention  and strength building during their early midlife years — instead of waiting on good health to run out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s00083b6n6ov82pfb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those years — think 35 to 45&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;years old — can be used as a time to strengthen oneself rather than to succumb to the myth that one’s best days are in the past, she said. Wright calls it the “critical decade.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s00093b6n8y11wat1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I believe and have shown that with a daily investment in our mobility, in smart nutrition, in mobilizing our mindset,” Wright said, “we can live healthy, vital, active, joyful, unbreakable lives long into the foreseeable future.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000a3b6nkrq3d1rj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Vonda Wright: &lt;/strong&gt;I spend a lot of time in the first part of my book asking women to identify what their values are — their “why” for making changes. I value independence — getting to do what I want when I want to do it. If I receive help, it’s because I want it, not because I need it. I value a clear brain. Once you know your values, you can form your goals. Many women don’t want to be a burden to their children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wright:&lt;/strong&gt; There are estrogen receptors everywhere, from brain to muscle to bone. Without estrogen, nearly every organ system is affected, meaning the rate of aging increases. For instance, during &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/10/health/menopause-women-midlife-hormones-wellness"&gt;the perimenopause period&lt;/a&gt;, women can lose 15% to 20% of our bone density. That’s more rapid (than the bone density loss men  experience as they age). The brain starves without estrogen, and the lack can also increase inflammation and risk for cardiovascular disease. Making your hormone optimization decision &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/hormone-therapy-for-menopause" target="_blank"&gt;based on facts&lt;/a&gt;, not fear, is one of the first decisions I want women to make.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wright: &lt;/strong&gt;I’m going to give you some frameworks and practical tips. No. 1: We are not losing weight. We are recomposing, meaning it matters what we’re made of, because we’re trying to maximize lean muscle and minimize body fat — not to be skinny but to be lean.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000i3b6nikdmjwe1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No. 2: Women &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/26/health/eating-disorders-food-2023-wellness"&gt;deserve to eat&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve been taught for generations that we can only be little, and therefore we don’t eat. But you must eat to be healthy, so what do we eat? I’m a big proponent of 1 gram of protein per ideal pound a day, so that we support the muscle we’re trying to build.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000j3b6nqhst6t22@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But we have got to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/28/health/cutting-added-sugar-recommendations-wellness"&gt;stop eating so much sugar&lt;/a&gt; in this country, because it’s cooking us from the inside out. It contributes to multiple diseases caused by chronic, age-related inflammation. I’m not against carbs; I’m against simple carbs and sugar because of what they do to &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000941.htm" target="_blank"&gt;our glycemic index&lt;/a&gt;, which measures how quickly a food makes your blood sugar rise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            I’d rather people get their nutrition &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/01/health/mediterranean-diet-recipes-wellness"&gt;from whole foods&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s partly why the book also contains recipes and dinner plans.

            &lt;strong&gt;Wright: &lt;/strong&gt;I prescribe exercise with the acronym “FACE” your future.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000n3b6n6z2hq34x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;The F is flexibility and joint range of motion&lt;/strong&gt;. Tendons, ligaments and muscles naturally shorten with time, which results in stiff joints and people being hunched over and shuffling around. Some great exercises for that are Pilates, yoga, tai chi and dynamic stretching.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000o3b6nn2u7jmkq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;The &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/10/health/cardio-aerobic-exercise-routine-wellness"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A is aerobic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; The book has a big outline for caring for your heart, and it is not high-intensity interval training seven days a week. I prescribe 80-20 aerobic activity, which means 80% of the time we are in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/health/talk-test-exercise-intensity-cdc-wellness"&gt;lower heart rate exercise&lt;/a&gt;, whether it’s walking or something else, and 20% of the time we are sprinting. This is modeled after what we do with pro athletes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000p3b6n04w8gi1q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;The C is “carry a load.”&lt;/strong&gt; Our goal is strength and power, so lifting heavy is very well detailed for hundreds of pages in this book. Basically, it means fewer reps, higher weights.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000q3b6n339t80ap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Finally, E is equilibrium&lt;/strong&gt;, or balance, and foot speed. You may be strong and flexible, but if you trip and fall, you often have what’s called a fatal fall and break something that 50% of the time puts you in a nursing home.
    &lt;/p&gt;

For seven days in a row, you’re doing something that’s helpful to your body, such as walking every day after your biggest meal. Then you don’t want to stop because you’ve worked hard.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Also start a foundational or starting lifting program. I have one of those in my book, just to teach you how to move your body. It will take six or nine months to work up to heavy, but it’s not hard. Hiring a trainer to teach you is very helpful. I encourage people, as the holidays are coming up, don’t ask for a purse or some appliance. Ask for a trainer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Once you arrive there, that is what you should do for the rest of your life, because we’re trying to build strength and power, not necessarily endurance or bigger muscles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What are the best ways to build mental resilience?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000x3b6n161akm60@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wright: &lt;/strong&gt;The work that I cite in the book is built around &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/13/health/how-to-choose-therapist-wellness"&gt;building mental hardiness&lt;/a&gt;, and there are 10 hardiness factors. Interestingly, one of them is physical activity. The &lt;a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/13740661" target="_blank"&gt;research I looked at&lt;/a&gt;, by Dr. Paul Bartone and Dr. Steven Stein, was done on prisoners of war, current US Army Rangers and people with really tough congenital problems. One common characteristic of all those people is they had a physical activity practice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000y3b6nrqtthf2p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you learn to lift heavy, what happens physically is you get stronger. But every time you’re done lifting, your brain feels invincible. Another example is that I do Spartan Stadion obstacle course races in legendary stadiums, and I frequently invite women who follow me on social media to join me. They show up in all states of fitness — some not fit, some world-class athletes. When they finish doing hard physical things, their brain has also changed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000z3b6nabhqagai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s really important to realize that you are worth the daily investment in your health. Many times people, especially women, prioritize everything in the world in front of themselves. But the reality is, to do the work, we need to realize that we are worth the daily investment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;The 75-year-old who still drives herself to book club, the 82-year-old managing his investments online, the couple in their late 70s who just booked another trip abroad—they all share something beyond good genes or luck. They've mastered the art of the quiet habit, those small, consistent practices that compound into independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask them their secret, and they won't mention miracle supplements or extreme fitness routines. Instead, they'll tell you about morning stretches, afternoon walks, evening puzzles. The unglamorous stuff that doesn't sell magazines but does preserve autonomy. These aren't the habits of superhumans; they're the practices of people who understand that maintaining independence isn't about grand gestures but daily maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science backs them up. Independence after 70 isn't just about physical health—it's a delicate ecosystem of mental sharpness, social connection, and purposeful routine. And the people who crack the code? They're the ones treating their independence like a garden: tending it daily, quietly, consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They move something every single morning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a workout. Not yoga at dawn. Just movement—gentle, deliberate, non-negotiable. Maybe it's ten minutes of stretching before their feet hit the floor. Perhaps it's walking to get the newspaper instead of having it delivered. The specifics don't matter; the consistency does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't about fitness goals or step counts. It's about sending a daily message to your body: we're still in business. &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/everyday-fitness/senior-workouts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Regular movement&lt;/a&gt; maintains joint flexibility, preserves balance, and keeps muscles from atrophying. But more importantly, it sets a tone for the day that says "I'm capable." The 78-year-old who starts with morning stretches is more likely to tackle afternoon gardening, evening cooking. It's momentum disguised as a morning routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They keep their brain on a low simmer all day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won't find them doing marathon Sudoku sessions or cramming for mental fitness. Instead, they pepper their day with small cognitive challenges. Reading the news and discussing it. Trying a new recipe without checking the instructions twice. Taking a different route to familiar places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/healthy-aging/participating-activities-you-enjoy-you-age" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cognitive engagement&lt;/a&gt; doesn't require formal brain training. The sharper seniors treat their minds like muscles that need varied exercise throughout the day, not intense weekly workouts. They argue (gently) about politics, learn their grandkid's video game, attempt the crossword without immediately googling. These micro-challenges maintain neural plasticity better than any app claiming to reverse aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They schedule something social before noon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not parties or large gatherings—just connection. Coffee with a neighbor at 10 AM. A standing Tuesday grocery trip with a friend. A morning call to check on someone. They've learned that &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/healthy-aging/10-common-misconceptions-about-aging" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;social isolation&lt;/a&gt; creeps in quietly, so they build defenses into their morning routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morning social contact serves multiple purposes. It provides accountability (someone notices if you don't show up), mental stimulation (conversation exercises different brain regions than solitary activities), and emotional regulation (human connection stabilizes mood). The truly clever ones combine it with other needs—walking groups, breakfast clubs, volunteer shifts. They're not just being social; they're engineering reasons to stay engaged with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They tackle their hardest task before lunch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bills, medical calls, complex decisions—whatever requires the most mental energy happens in the morning. Not because they're morning people necessarily, but because they've noticed their cognitive reserves peak before noon. By 2 PM, even simple tasks feel monumental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't procrastination management; it's energy economics. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/28/nx-s1-5477556/aging-brain-health-lifestyle-diet-exercise-social-alzheimers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Successful aging&lt;/a&gt; involves recognizing your body's rhythms and working with them, not against them. The independent seniors have learned to surf their energy waves rather than fight them. Complex medication management at 9 AM, not 9 PM. Important conversations when sharp, not tired. They're quietly strategic about when they deploy their cognitive resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They eat the same healthy breakfast without thinking about it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No daily debates about what to eat. No decision fatigue over breakfast. They've found something nutritious that works—oatmeal with walnuts, eggs with spinach, yogurt with berries—and they stick with it. Boring? Maybe. Effective? Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't about the perfect diet; it's about removing friction from healthy choices. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9903079/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Nutritional consistency&lt;/a&gt; in older adults correlates with better health outcomes, not because any single breakfast is magical, but because automation frees mental energy for other decisions. When eating well becomes as automatic as brushing teeth, it's more likely to happen even on difficult days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They maintain one thing they control completely&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A garden plot. A workshop. A craft room. A recipe collection. Something that's entirely theirs, where they make all the decisions, where their competence is unquestioned. This domain becomes their independence laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having an area of complete autonomy does something profound psychologically. It counters the creeping helplessness that often accompanies aging. When you can't control your declining vision but can control your tomato plants, you maintain what psychologists call self-efficacy. These personal kingdoms, however small, become proof that they're still capable agents in their own lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They prep tomorrow tonight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clothes laid out. Pills organized. Shopping list written. Coffee maker loaded. They spend ten minutes each evening removing tomorrow's friction. It's not about memory issues—it's about energy conservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This evening ritual serves as both practical preparation and psychological reassurance. Waking up to a day that's already partially handled reduces morning stress and preserves decision-making capacity for unexpected challenges. But more subtly, it's an act of self-compassion—tonight's self taking care of tomorrow's self. The independent elderly have learned to be their own best assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. They protect their sleep like a vault&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No late-night TV binges. No revenge bedtime procrastination. They treat sleep like the medical intervention it is. Consistent bedtime, consistent wake time, bedroom kept cool and dark. They're not rigid about it, but they're respectful of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/healthy-aging/10-common-misconceptions-about-aging" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Quality sleep in older adults&lt;/a&gt; affects everything: cognitive function, physical recovery, emotional regulation, immune response. The independent seniors have noticed the correlation between bad nights and bad days. So they've quietly built fortresses around their sleep: no caffeine after 2 PM, no screens in bed, no trying to "push through" fatigue. They've learned that protecting sleep is protecting independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what's striking about these habits: they're all defensive plays, not offensive ones. The successfully independent elderly aren't trying to turn back time or achieve peak performance. They're playing prevent defense against dependence. Every morning stretch is a hedge against immobility. Every social coffee is insurance against isolation. Every protected sleep hour is an investment in tomorrow's clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They've figured out what younger people often miss: independence isn't a state you achieve but a condition you maintain. Like a garden or a friendship or a skill, it requires daily attention—not dramatic intervention, just consistent, quiet care. These habits aren't sexy or revolutionary. They won't trend on social media or spawn bestselling books. But they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real wisdom isn't in any single habit but in the approach: small, sustainable, stackable. The 70-somethings who thrive understand that independence is won in the margins, in the thousand tiny decisions that either preserve capability or surrender it. They've learned to be gentle architects of their own autonomy, building independence not through force but through patience, not through intensity but through consistency. And in that quiet persistence, they've found the secret to something increasingly rare: aging on their own terms.&lt;/p&gt;

ROACH: I am a 68-year-old male who weighs 130 pounds and is 5 feet, 7 inches tall. I am in good shape and work out regularly. I had my prostate removed in 2023 after about six years of active surveillance, and I just finished radiation treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VYJHB3LBZZBNNIFLQ7IQSVZCDM"&gt;I’ve taken vitamins for as long as I can remember. I take Centrum Silver multivitamins, fish oil, calcium, and vitamin D for osteoporosis. When doing some research, I read that selenium and vitamin E are not good to take if you have prostate cancer, and they are included in Centrum Silver. The fish oil had conflicting information, with some saying it was good and others saying it wasn’t good to take if you have prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PDUVEA5AGJDPLAJR4642KHPPGU"&gt;Should I continue taking these vitamins, or should I stop? Could these have made my cancer worse? If I stop, should I wean off them or stop altogether? What are your recommendations on these vitamins/supplements affecting prostate cancer or my health in general? I would hate to think that taking them could do more harm than good. I eat very well (lots of fruits, vegetables, chicken, fish, and lean red meats). I drink green tea and lots of water to stay hydrated. -- Anon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JFBRGOOTFFB5PHWKBG7TAYFH2E"&gt;ANSWER: Several supplements have been associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. The evidence is moderately strong with vitamin E. A large study designed to look for benefits had to be stopped by the safety committee, and an analysis showed a 17% increased risk of prostate cancer with vitamin E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="I6P2SOICYRE25DSNJGI5P5RLTA"&gt;Some studies found an increase in prostate cancer risk with fish oil, while others didn’t. In my opinion, men with prostate cancer (or those who are at a high risk for it) should not take vitamin E. Unless you are clearly recommended fish oil based on your triglyceride level or for some other clinical indication, I don’t recommend it either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BGJI746DK5BONAT5IRUHQ2KKBA"&gt;Because your multivitamin contains vitamin E and selenium, another mineral that may increase prostate cancer risk, I recommend against it for any man with prostate cancer. There is no need to taper off it slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="J6QCXV3RQJAXPEFWGY4RTTJM4E"&gt;As far as diet, a more plant-based diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and healthy fats with limited intake of animal fats, processed meats and refined carbohydrates has been shown to improve outcomes among prostate cancer survivors. Lean meats are better than fatty ones, but I would still emphasize plants more. Green tea has speculated but unproven benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: I am a 78-year-male in overall good health. Based on certain symptoms (foamy urine and a previous eGFR of 55), my nephrologist has instructed me to have a metabolic blood test. Regarding the blood test, his instructions regarding the blood test were not to fast. I have never taken a metabolic test without fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7ATGGXJ5IVHVNE355PFWPO6N4Q"&gt;My research revealed that by fasting, your test results are more realistic. My research also revealed that by not fasting, one’s creatinine reading wouldn’t be affected. What should I do? Fast or not? -- B.E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2AW7TQJZGZBPLP75ZINTCOR3UE"&gt;ANSWER: Clearly you should heed the instructions of your nephrologist. Blood tests without fasting provide a measure of what your body chemistry is like under the most usual conditions. You are right that creatinine isn’t much affected by diet, although heavy meat consumption will make the creatinine reading a bit higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3Y7AVJQJ5JCP5BZRJKNUXWOIOA"&gt;Blood sugar and lipid tests are most affected by fasting, and while lipid tests are generally standardized to the fasting state, blood sugar tests need to be interpreted according to whether a person is fasting or not.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no question about it: it can be a challenge to switch from a carb-heavy eating plan to one that relies on eating more healthy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/longform/7821676/protein-nation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, which helps you feel more satisfied and keeps you feeling fuller longer. I started focusing on getting more protein in my meals when I set about losing the weight that I had gained during my heady first few years as a restaurant critic. So much of what I once considered convenience food simply wasn’t on the menu once I committed to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292114/high-protein-meal-plan-1500-calories/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-protein meal plan&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While most of my dinners at home focus on lean meat (or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-protein-plant-based-diet-recipes-to-make-first-11735924" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based proteins&lt;/a&gt;) and vegetables, my busy workdays require me to keep things simpler at lunch and snack times. Buying some high-protein staples that don’t require refrigeration makes my life easier and my wallet heavier, but most important, these staples leave me feeling good after I eat them. Here are my standbys. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I’m far from a vegetarian, but I appreciate the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/most-saved-chickpea-recipes-11785873" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lean protein offered by using chickpeas&lt;/a&gt; as the centerpiece of a meal. I may have learned to cook them first as part of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/255186/chickpea-curry-chhole/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Indian recipes&lt;/a&gt;, but the legumes are super-versatile. I like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/279247/everything-bagel-crispy-chickpeas/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;crisping them up and coating them in everything seasoning for a snack&lt;/a&gt;, but few recipes feed my need for creamy, tomatoey goodness quite like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/marry-me-chickpeas-8431869" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;using chickpeas in a meat-free version of Marry Me Chicken&lt;/a&gt;. It’s like a hybrid of my beloved Indian stews and the best of Italy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though there’s nothing quite like making your own jerky with an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/affiliate/7904760/best-food-dehydrators/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;at-home dehydrator&lt;/a&gt;, I am among the majority of people that simply don’t have the time to do so regularly. As a devotee of Korean barbecue, I sometimes treat myself to the almost dessert-like charms of Golden Island pork jerky from Costco, but more often, I just buy Walmart-brand beef jerky, with its 13 grams of protein and 5 grams of total carbs per serving.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; My mother eats an early dinner, then finishes the evening with what she calls a “tummy filler.” Using her as inspiration, when I’m still hungry after dinner, my favorite “tummy filler” is slices of Macintosh apple with almond butter. An open secret? This is even better with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/251354/apple-with-cinnamon-almond-butter/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;a dusting of cinnamon&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When I lived in Texas, you wouldn’t have caught me dead adding beans to chili. But then a dear friend sent me a Rancho Gordo chili kit as an unexpected wedding gift. I realized that I loved both the texture and low-fat protein of the heirloom beans. Now I’m more likely to do an inexpensive riff using canned pinto or Great Northern beans &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269830/chicken-chili-verde/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;in a recipe with boneless, skinless chicken thighs&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8070574/favorite-high-protein-recipe-for-weight-loss/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;I lost 30 pounds&lt;/a&gt; of my restaurant-critic weight a decade ago, my secrets were lean protein at dinner and filling soups at lunch. Often, that meant less-than-appealing protein-powder potages, but since then, I’ve discovered that when I don’t have time to make my own more flavorful options, cans of Progresso will do in a pinch. I prefer to stick to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7981788/low-sodium-foods-list/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduced-sodium options&lt;/a&gt;, including Italian wedding soup, which boasts around 160 calories per can and keeps me full until dinner.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s nothing wrong with eating regular pasta sometimes (&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitian-dont-always-eat-whole-wheat-pasta-8648575" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;just ask our in-house dietitian&lt;/a&gt;), but when I’m trying to get a little extra &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7833141/high-protein-pasta-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;protein out of my noodle dish&lt;/a&gt;, I lean on wheat replacements like Barilla’s Protein+, which is made with a blend of conventional flour, chickpeas, lentils and peas. It doesn’t cook up grainy like old-school “healthy” pastas, so I don’t feel guilty serving it to the rest of my family.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For years, I avoided having any kind of bread in my house. But I often went through my days feeling slightly hungry. Finding the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7897382/im-a-dietitian-and-this-is-my-favorite-healthy-bread/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;right bread&lt;/a&gt; made my life happier. My favorite is the sliced seeds and grains loaf from The Avocado Bread Company. It’s a hearty, rustic cousin to my old favorites from Dave’s Killer Bread, but with 5 grams of protein per slice, less sweetness, and a hint of guacamole-style spices like cumin and paprika. I use it not just in sandwiches, but also as breadcrumbs in meatballs. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; My mother started adding &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nut-for-heart-health-8604884" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;walnuts to salads for heart health&lt;/a&gt; when I was a teenager.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Having a supply of high-protein foods on hand at all times in my pantry makes it easy to add more protein any time I feel my meals are lacking. The best part is that the budget-friendliness of most of my favorites keeps my grocery bill mercifully low. That means I might have a little extra in my budget to splurge on higher-quality meats or specialty fruits and vegetables. &lt;br&gt;

The ideas presented lacked nuance and framed one set of choices as right and the other as wrong — a hallmark of pseudoscience. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only one panelist, Dr. Kay Roussos-Ross, M.D., &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-07-23/fda-panel-on-ssri-antidepressants-in-pregnancy-raises-alarms" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="highlighted the potential benefits of antidepressants during pregnancy" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68af404ce4b0bbcc3f8d9407" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-07-23/fda-panel-on-ssri-antidepressants-in-pregnancy-raises-alarms" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="20"&gt;&lt;span&gt;highlighted the potential benefits of antidepressants during pregnancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. She shared that suicide is the No. 1 cause of maternal death during the perinatal period and referred to antidepressants as one of the “tools” available to combat this epidemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Antidepressants may not suit everyone’s needs, and they are not the only treatment for mental health (although they are often the most accessible). For many people with mental illness, they are considered the first line of defense and can even enhance the effectiveness of other treatment modalities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking my antidepressant makes me a better mom. My kids (including the one in my womb) reap the benefits of a mother who is not spiraling into a pit of anxiety and despair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although it’s not a magic bullet, my SSRI allows me to manage my pendulum of emotions and complete the many tasks and responsibilities that go along with being a working parent, military spouse, and mom to littles. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mild side effects and risks associated with taking my antidepressant pale in comparison to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://policycentermmh.org/maternal-mental-health-fact-sheet/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="risks of untreated maternal mental health disorders" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68af404ce4b0bbcc3f8d9407" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://policycentermmh.org/maternal-mental-health-fact-sheet/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="21"&gt;&lt;span&gt;risks of untreated maternal mental health disorders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which include low birth weight, preterm birth, preeclampsia, difficulty bonding after birth and an overall increased risk of infant and maternal mortality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During the panel discussion, Roussos-Ross emphasized the importance of balancing the treatment of both mother and child, stating that one’s health is not more important than the other’s. When I watched the panel, it struck me how many of the “experts” dismissed the mother’s well-being, amplifying the pervasive cultural myth that mothers must deny their own needs in service to their offspring (which is promoted by trends like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691822001299" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="intensive mothering" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68af404ce4b0bbcc3f8d9407" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691822001299" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="22"&gt;&lt;span&gt;intensive mothering&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and natural parenting). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/the-perinatal-depression-treatment-cascade/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Less than 16%" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68af404ce4b0bbcc3f8d9407" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/the-perinatal-depression-treatment-cascade/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="23"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Less than 16%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of women with maternal depression (including both antenatal and postpartum depression) receive treatment, due to a lack of awareness and stigma. Mothers deserve access to current, accurate and evidence-based information so that they can make informed decisions with support from their healthcare providers. They need to know that opting to take an SSRI during pregnancy does not mean that they’re a “bad mom” or that they’re failing their kid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m grateful that I’ve had the choice to continue taking my SSRI throughout my pregnancies, and I worry that the FDA’s recent panel will limit women’s choices during a time when our freedoms are already under attack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moms like me matter ― and if we need antidepressants to be healthy and to take the best possible care of our kids, then we should all have access to them ― with no judgment attached. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

I plod down the stairs, gripping the rail to lighten my steps so as not to wake my two toddlers. The following 30-45 minutes of alone time are a treasured commodity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After letting the dog out and feeding him (because even with the kids asleep, I still have another creature’s needs to consider before my own), I settle into my desk chair with my coffee, water and toast. I glance at the calendar ― just two more weeks until my mom flies in town to help with the kids. Changing and lifting my 2.5-year-old and 15-month-old had begun to feel like an Olympic sport with the 40 pounds of extra weight I’d been carrying. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next to my calendar hangs the ultrasound photos from my most recent scan.

When I watched the panel, it struck me how many of the “experts” dismissed the mother’s well-being, amplifying the pervasive cultural myth that mothers must deny their own needs in service to their offspring (which is promoted by trends like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691822001299" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="intensive mothering" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68af404ce4b0bbcc3f8d9407" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691822001299" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="23"&gt;&lt;span&gt;intensive mothering&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and natural parenting). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/the-perinatal-depression-treatment-cascade/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Less than 16%" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68af404ce4b0bbcc3f8d9407" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/the-perinatal-depression-treatment-cascade/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="24"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Less than 16%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of women with maternal depression (including both antenatal and postpartum depression) receive treatment, due to a lack of awareness and stigma.

Your coworkers are popping magnesium glycinate before bed instead of melatonin, because it allegedly cures insomnia, constipation, and existential dread. Folks seem especially concerned with optimizing their poop and pillow time. In the past year, &lt;a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;amp;q=which%20magnesium%20is%20best%20for%20sleep,which%20magnesium%20makes%20you%20poop&amp;amp;hl=en-GB" target="_blank"&gt;Google searches&lt;/a&gt; for “which magnesium is best for sleep” and “which magnesium makes you poop” have more than doubled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Magnesium is essential for maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system. It’s also one of the most abundant minerals in the human body, running &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;more than 300 biochemical reactions&lt;/a&gt;, from protein synthesis to nerve function and blood sugar regulation. It supports bone structure and helps shuttle calcium and potassium across cell membranes, a process that allows for muscle contractions and normal heart rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;You can get it from foods like legumes, leafy vegetables, and whole grains, or from fortified foods and dietary supplements.

This is partly because magnesium is predominantly found in high-fiber foods, and a significant portion of Americans do not consume sufficient fiber, according to registered dietitian Sue-Ellen Anderson-Haynes. Research confirms this: &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf"}' href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;More than 90 percent of women&lt;/a&gt; and 97 percent of men fail to meet the recommended daily intake for dietary fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Older adults are particularly at risk, as the body's ability to absorb magnesium decreases with age. Health conditions like Crohn’s disease or kidney disease, alcohol use disorder, and the use of diuretics can all lead to magnesium depletion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Anderson-Haynes notes that a magnesium deficiency (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30987399/" target="_blank"&gt;also known as hypomagnesemia&lt;/a&gt;) can result in a range of symptoms, such as headaches, nausea, constipation, tremors, heart palpitations, and muscle soreness. Chronic magnesium deficiency can increase the risk of developing high blood pressure, osteoporosis, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="benefits-of-magnesium-supplements" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Benefits of Magnesium Supplements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;There are several forms of magnesium supplements, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="paywall"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium citrate&lt;/strong&gt;: Often taken as a remedy for occasional constipation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium glycinate:&lt;/strong&gt; Often taken for better sleep and reduced anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium oxide:&lt;/strong&gt; Often taken for constipation or indigestion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium l-threonate:&lt;/strong&gt; Often taken for better sleep, cognitive function, and reduced stress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium chloride:&lt;/strong&gt; Often taken as an electrolyte replenisher and for its laxative effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Supplements are most useful for people with a confirmed deficiency, but &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/what-can-magnesium-do-for-you-and-how-much-do-you-need-202506033100" target="_blank"&gt;early research suggests&lt;/a&gt; possible benefits for specific conditions, including migraines, insomnia, and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“It’s really overlooked that magnesium can help with menstrual cycle irregularity in terms of making sure that you’re not having severe cramping,” says Anderson-Haynes, who adds it may also benefit &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/oura-perimenopause-report/" target="_blank"&gt;women in perimenopause&lt;/a&gt; and menopause. Clinically, it may be part of the treatment for pregnancy complications like preeclampsia and eclampsia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="can-you-take-too-much" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Can You Take Too Much?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;recommended dietary allowance&lt;/a&gt; is 320 milligrams per day for women and 420 milligrams per day for men. These are amounts most people can reach with a balanced diet; healthy kidneys regulate magnesium levels, excreting excess when magnesium intake is high and conserving it when it’s low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Daily supplements under 350 milligrams are generally considered safe for healthy adults. “If you take too much magnesium, you’ll probably get diarrhea, because it loosens the bowels,” Anderson-Haynes says. Other side effects include nausea, gastrointestinal discomfort, and, at very high levels of magnesium (usually from overusing laxatives or antacids), low blood pressure, muscle cramps, breathing problems, and, in rare cases, cardiac arrest. People with kidney disease are at the highest risk of toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="should-you-supplement" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Should You Supplement?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;For most healthy adults, magnesium supplements aren’t essential. If you struggle &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-science-of-why-migraines-affect-women-more-than-men/" target="_blank"&gt;with migraines&lt;/a&gt;, insomnia, or other conditions where research suggests health benefits, they may be worth trying—but first talk to a health care professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Otherwise, focus on magnesium-rich foods. These include but are not limited to: legumes (beans, lentils, chickpeas), leafy greens (artichokes, kale, spinach), whole grains (oats, barley, quinoa), nuts (almonds, cashews, peanuts), fruit (bananas, avocado, dried apricots), and soy products (tofu, soy milk, edamame).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;If you do decide to take any dietary supplements, “look for a seal or certification that says GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) or NSF,” says Anderson-Haynes, stressing the importance of third-party tests and verifications, considering &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fda-label-cleared-approved/" target="_blank"&gt;the FDA doesn't regulate dietary supplements&lt;/a&gt; in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="GridWrapper-cFSKbf gBsRaY

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added: 'In one interview, a doctor said: “In patients with gastrointestinal tumors, a few months before the diagnosis, a strong craving for sweets appears. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'"People eat ice cream by the kilo, even though they never cared for desserts before.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The explanation is clear: tumor cells consume glucose faster than healthy ones, so the brain starts programming behavior to serve the disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The influencer also revealed a woman who was later diagnosed with kidney cancer, had claimed she could drink 'pickle brine straight from the jar and eat it with crackers'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another suddenly got 'hooked' on dairy products. Relatives thought it was just 'a phase' or 'new tastes'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'In reality, the body sends messages in advance—most just delete them without even opening,' they added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Limited research has also suggested that changes in food behaviour could be a pre-cursor to cancer diagnoses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In one 2022 review, analysing seven studies on the topic, Italian researchers noted that 'food cravings have been found to be associated with breast cancer, lymphoma, and ovarian or endometrial cancer'. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But the orange-yellow stains on the lab coats slung on hooks hint at a less-usual subject matter under study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The powdery stain is pollen: microscopic grains containing male reproductive cells that trees, weeds and grasses &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/the-five-most-common-seasonal-allergies" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/the-five-most-common-seasonal-allergies"&gt;release seasonally&lt;/a&gt;. But Cho isn't studying irksome effects like hay fever, or what pollen means for the plants that make it. Instead, the material scientist has spent a decade pioneering and refining techniques to remodel pollen's rigid outer shell — made of a polymer so tough it's sometimes called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-diamond-of-the-plant-world-helped-land-plants-evolve-20220719/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-diamond-of-the-plant-world-helped-land-plants-evolve-20220719/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;"the diamond of the plant world"&lt;/a&gt; — transforming the grains to a jam-like consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="0f587a72-0361-429b-9baf-bcb5022ed5af-2"&gt;This microgel, Cho believes, could be a versatile building block for many eco-friendly materials, including paper, film and sponges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="f3244f31-b7c0-4048-80bb-7b3e46fa3b20"&gt;A lot of people think of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2024/butterfly-migration-pollen-tracking" target="_blank" data-url="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2024/butterfly-migration-pollen-tracking" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;pollen&lt;/a&gt;, when it's not fertilizing plants or &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/animals/insects/how-do-insects-know-which-flowers-have-pollen" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/animals/insects/how-do-insects-know-which-flowers-have-pollen"&gt;feeding insects&lt;/a&gt;, as useless dust, but it has valuable applications if you know how to work with it,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;says Cho, who coauthored an overview of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-chembioeng-101121-085959" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-chembioeng-101121-085959" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;pollen's prospective applications&lt;/a&gt; in the 2024 &lt;em&gt;Annual Review of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering&lt;/em&gt;. He's not the only scientist to think so. Noemi Csaba, a nanotechnology and drug delivery researcher at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Spain, wants to develop hollowed-out pollen shells into protective vehicles to deliver drugs to the eyes, lungs and stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers studying pollen's usefulness to people are a rare breed, Csaba says. "I find it a bit surprising," she says. "Pollen is a very, very interesting biomaterial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/chemistry/new-wonder-material-designed-by-ai-is-as-light-as-foam-but-as-strong-as-steel" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/chemistry/new-wonder-material-designed-by-ai-is-as-light-as-foam-but-as-strong-as-steel"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New wonder material designed by AI is as light as foam but as strong as steel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-a4f81009-de92-4f24-9254-c697a149bf0b" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="softening-the-shell-3"&gt;Softening the shell&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="740472c1-dbdb-4ca2-b6e7-4904368ab305"&gt;To begin working with pollen, scientists can remove the sticky coating around the grains in a process called defatting. Stripping away these lipids and allergenic proteins is the first step in creating the empty capsules for drug delivery that Csaba seeks. Beyond that, however, pollen's seemingly impenetrable shell — made up of the biopolymer sporopollenin — had long stumped researchers and limited its use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-jj2MJSEC3C75e7TpYmvezC" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-jj2MJSEC3C75e7TpYmvezC slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A breakthrough came in 2020, when Cho and his team reported that incubating pollen in an alkaline solution of potassium hydroxide at 80 degrees Celsius (176 degrees Fahrenheit) could &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_1283570300103064632&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-020-15294-w&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Ftechnology%2Fscientists-propose-using-pollen-to-make-paper-and-sponges" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15294-w" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-020-15294-w&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Ftechnology%2Fscientists-propose-using-pollen-to-make-paper-and-sponges" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;significantly alter the surface chemistry of pollen grains&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to readily absorb and retain water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting pollen is as pliable as Play-Doh, says Shahrudin Ibrahim, a research fellow in Cho's lab who helped to develop the technique. Before the treatment, pollen grains are more like marbles: hard, inert and largely unreactive. After, the particles are so soft they stick together easily, allowing more complex structures to form. This opens up numerous applications, Ibrahim says, proudly holding up a vial of the yellow-brown slush in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When cast onto a flat mold and dried out, the microgel assembles into a paper or film, depending on the final thickness, that is strong yet flexible. It is also sensitive to external stimuli, including changes in pH and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1922560117" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1922560117" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;humidity&lt;/a&gt;. Exposure to the alkaline solution causes pollen's constituent polymers to become more hydrophilic, or water-loving, so depending on the conditions, the gel will swell or shrink due to the absorption or expulsion of water, explains Ibrahim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="9dda74ef-d0b7-441f-995e-10f959f80fee"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;For technical applications, pollen grains are first stripped of their allergy-inducing sticky coating, in a process called defatting. Next, if treated with acid, they form hollow sporopollenin capsules that can be used to deliver drugs. If treated instead with an alkaline solution, the defatted pollen grains are transformed into a soft microgel that can be used to make thin films, paper and sponges. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Knowable Magazine, &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;CC BY-ND&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="134804bd-6bce-45cd-955f-e5424090f85f"&gt;This winning combination of properties, the Singaporean researchers believe, makes pollen-based film a prospect for many future applications: smart actuators that allow devices to detect and respond to changes in their surroundings, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/admt.202200446" data-url="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/admt.202200446" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;wearable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211285517302173" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211285517302173" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;health trackers&lt;/a&gt; to monitor heart signals, and more. And because pollen is naturally UV-protective, there's the possibility it could &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202100566" target="_blank" data-url="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202100566" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;substitute&lt;/a&gt; for certain photonically active substrates in perovskite solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cho's lab has also demonstrated that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35289432/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35289432/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;paper made from pollen can be printed on&lt;/a&gt;. It may be a sustainable alternative to traditional paper for writing, printing and packaging, according to Cho, who has patented the microgel's production process. Producing traditional paper destroys trees and is resource-intensive, requiring &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/the-green-and-blue-water-footprint-of-paper-products-methodologic" target="_blank" data-url="https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/the-green-and-blue-water-footprint-of-paper-products-methodologic" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;up to 13 liters of water&lt;/a&gt; for every page made. Pollen is naturally released in bulk from seed-producing plants, and deriving paper from it requires only a few simple steps. Ink can be removed with a simple alkaline solution wash — a process that lets the paper be reused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, freeze-dried pollen microgel forms porous sponges. These could be made into such things as scaffolds for tissue engineering, or used to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.202311684" target="_blank" data-url="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.202311684" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;stem bleeding&lt;/a&gt; or to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202101091" target="_blank" data-url="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202101091" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;absorb oil spills&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cho's team usually works with sunflower and camellia pollen that they purchase inexpensively as a bee pollen mixture, mainly from &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/china" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. But they say their alkaline hydrolysis method would work well with a broad swath of plant species. Pollen is abundant, Cho adds — a single floret of the common sunflower, for instance, produces&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=403104#:~:text=Pollen%20quantity%20(%CB%9C%2025%2C000%E2%80%9367%2C000%20grains%20per%20floret),quantity%20were%20unrelated%20to%20pollen%20grain%20size." target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=403104#:~:text=Pollen%20quantity%20(%CB%9C%2025%2C000%E2%80%9367%2C000%20grains%20per%20floret),quantity%20were%20unrelated%20to%20pollen%20grain%20size." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; 25,000 to 67,000 grains&lt;/a&gt; every summer.

With other biomaterials researchers are working on, such as chitosan and cellulose, a crustacean or a tree must be destroyed. Compared with that, pollen is considerably less resource-intensive: "We're not destroying the plant," he says.

In one phase, they consumed nitrate-rich beetroot juice (a.k.a. beet juice) daily. In the second phase, people consumed a placebo version of the drink with nitrates removed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;In case you’re not familiar with nitrates, they're compounds of &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/mn/what-nitrate" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.epa.gov/mn/what-nitrate" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="nitrogen and oxygen" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;nitrogen and oxygen&lt;/a&gt; that occur naturally in the soil, water, vegetables, and processed meats.

The researchers also used bacterial gene sequencing to find microbes that were in the participants’ mouths before and after each treatment phase. They took blood pressure readings, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Researchers ultimately found that participants' oral microbiome changed dramatically after they consumed the nitrate-rich beet juice, but there were differences between the older and younger groups. The older group experienced a noticeable drop in the oral bacteria Prevotella after drinking beet juice, as well as an increase in good oral bacteria, like Neisseria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The older group initially had higher average blood pressure readings at the beginning of the study, but their blood pressure dropped after they had the nitrate-rich beetroot juice. (But not after they had the placebo drink.)   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-do-beets-help-lower-blood-pressure" data-node-id="12" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.0"&gt;How do beets help lower blood pressure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This isn’t the first study to link beets to lower blood pressure. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8965354/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8965354/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="scientific analysis" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;scientific analysis&lt;/a&gt; published in 2022 found that people saw an improvement in their blood pressure consuming 70 milliliters, 140 milliliters, and 250 milliliters (about a cup) of beet juice a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939475324002369" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939475324002369" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="analysis" data-node-id="14.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; published in 2024 found that there was a “significant effect” on systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) up to 90 days after participants had a daily dose of beet juice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But…why? Well, it's a slightly complicated process. “Beets contain nitrates which are converted to nitrites by good bacteria in the mouth,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/sonya.angelone/?hl=en" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/sonya.angelone/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sonya Angelone, RDN," data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Sonya Angelone, RDN,&lt;/a&gt; a nutritionist and registered dietitian based in San Francisco. “The nitrites-rich saliva is swallowed, where it is converted to nitric oxide in the stomach.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;That nitric oxide is then absorbed into the bloodstream, where it helps blood vessels relax and widen, in a process called vasodilation, says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cheng-Han Chen, MD" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA. "This process improves blood pressure," he says.  &lt;br data-node-id="16.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The bacteria in your mouth matters, too. "Without the right balance of good bacteria in your mouth, the conversion of the nitrates in beets can’t happen, so you won't get the blood pressure-lowering effects from beets or beet root juice," says Christy Brissette, MS, RD, owner of &lt;a href="https://80twentynutrition.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://80twentynutrition.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="80 Twenty Nutrition." data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;80 Twenty Nutrition.&lt;/a&gt; "Eating a diet that is high in inorganic nitrates from beets and green leafy vegetables also seems to prevent the growth of unhealthy bacteria in the mouth, which could also help to lower blood pressure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-other-health-benefits-do-beets-have" data-node-id="19" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="19.0"&gt;What other health benefits do beets have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Beets actually have a lot going for them outside of blood pressure. They're also a good source of fiber "which is good for digestion and gut health,” Angelone says. And they contain antioxidants which can help reduce inflammation and lower your risk for chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Not only that, beets contain folate and potassium, which are good for heart health. “They may also support athletic performance by enhancing the mitochondrial function, the energy producing structure in the cells,” Angelone says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-should-i-be-eating-to-reap-the-benefits" data-node-id="22" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="22.0"&gt;How much should I be eating to reap the benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;To get the health benefits from beets, it’s good to eat about a cup of the veggie nearly every day, Angelone says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Of course, if you have high blood pressure, Brissette says it’s important to talk to your healthcare provider about the lifestyle moves you’re making to try to get that blood pressure back down. Also, keep in mind that beets or beet juice aren’t designed to replace any blood pressure-lowering medication you may be on—but they can support your efforts, per Dr. Chen.

But both chemophobia and the appeal to nature fallacy are central to pseudoscience, the anti-vaccine movement and the MAHA wellness industry, Love noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core of chemophobia and appeal to nature fallacy is also a “romanticization of ancestral living, when, in reality, we lived very poorly, we died very young and often suffering and in pain,” Love said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Going back to simpler times” are talking points for both MAHA and MAGA, which, of course, stands for “Make America Great Again,” a slogan that alludes to the past.

We turn not only to words like “good” or “bad,” but also “toxin-free,” “natural” and “clean,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing these words slapped on a jar of nut butter, on a shampoo bottle, or on sunscreen makes making the “right choice” easier, he added — “even though the evidence does not support what’s implied by those words, those ‘health halos,’” noted Caulfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These words are an “oversimplification,” Hardy said. “People now leverage their social media presence to share those oversimplified nutrition messages, most of which are at best, wrong, at worst, harmful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemophobia is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard to escape. It’s even built into marketing campaigns and product names.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever fallen into the chemophobia trap without knowing, you aren’t alone. It’s complicated and nuanced, and the science is, at times, messy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, chemophobia is the inspiration behind brand names and entire product categorizations; “clean beauty” is one huge example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fears of chemicals are now marketing ploys. “You’re going to find products that claim that they’re ‘chemical-free,’ and that doesn’t exist,” Love said, referring to the fact that, once again, everything is made up of chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market forces take over and cling to the chemophobia buzz words of the moment, whether that’s “clean” “gluten-free” or “non-GMO,” Caulfield said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, we have Triscuits labeled with non-GMO marketing, he said. We also have entire product lines at stores like Sephora that are categorized as “clean.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It creates this perception [of] ‘if that one’s chemical-free, then the alternative that isn’t labeled as such must be dangerous, must be bad,’” Love said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, making the “good” choice easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This isn’t to say there isn’t room for improvement in the health and food space.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I work in the public health space. I don’t know a single public health researcher, a single agricultural researcher, a single biomedical researcher who doesn’t want to make our food environment safer for everyone,” said Caulfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because Caulfield speaks out against chemophobia doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to make our food and health environment healthier, he stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do think we should always be challenging both industry and government to do exactly that, but at the same time, we have to be realistic and understand the nature of the risks and the magnitude of risks at play,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both our food environment and agricultural practices could be safer, “but those moves should be based on what the science says, and not on slogans,” Caulfield said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate greed and capitalism hinder these safety changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The huge irony here ... the answer to all of these chemophobia concerns ... it’s more government regulation. It’s more robust, science-informed regulation. And in this political environment, that ain’t going to happen, That just simply isn’t going to happen, as we’ve already seen,” Caulfield said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration wants to &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ap-us-trump-climate_n_688915f0e4b07dfa117e329f" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="repeal environmental protections" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68af1b19e4b0bbcc3f8d48a5" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="688915f0e4b07dfa117e329f" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="16"&gt;repeal environmental protections&lt;/a&gt;

If your 2024 goals include plans to drink in moderation, here’s what she wants you to know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How 1-2 Alcoholic Drinks Per Day Impact The Body In Your 20s, 30s And 40s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your 20s, Landsverk says, are a resilient time for the body — which is probably why hangovers aren’t nearly as bad during that decade. “The liver and brain have the most resilience during that time,” she said. “The frontal lobes (reasoning, and judgment) are not quite developed. One is more likely to be open to drinking more or taking more risks, and this can set habits that will cause problems down the line.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You probably won’t notice a huge difference as you head into your 30s as long as you’re drinking moderately, but it’s important to keep your overall health in mind. “Ask yourself: How is your health otherwise? Obesity, which is epidemic in America, increases the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver,” Landsverk said. “Alcohol increases the risk of liver disease and scarring (cirrhosis). As a geriatrician, I would say a glass or two a week is fine. Some doctors say one drink a day is fine, but it is also neurotoxic and that can catch up with you.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In your 40s, more health risks begin to pop up, Landsverk explains. “Obesity, diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol all increase the risk for heart attacks, strokes and small stroke dementia,” she said. If you’re living with any of these conditions, even a small amount of alcohol can further increase your risk of events like heart attacks or strokes, so keep that in mind. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How 1-2 Alcoholic Drinks Impact The Body In Your 50s And 60s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once you hit your 50s, Landsverk says, even moderate drinking can wreak havoc on the body. “Alcohol, besides the vascular damage and dementia risks, increases the risk of breast cancer, esophageal cancer and liver cancer (after disease),” she said. Because cancer risk drastically increases as we age, adding any amount of alcohol into the mix will only further increase that risk. “Plus, as we age, good sleep is more elusive,” Landsverk added. “Substances like caffeine, cigarettes and alcohol all hinder sleep”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In your 60s, you’ll likely begin to feel the effects of moderate drinking on your body. “I can speak from experience: This is the age when tolerance may decrease dramatically,” Landsverk said. “I am healthy.

Older people have less reserve in the brain, liver and kidneys.

The study, which systematically profiled 41 psychedelic compounds, suggests that these drugs activate multiple serotonin, dopamine, and adrenergic receptors, potentially explaining both their therapeutic effects and side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, researchers have known that the hallucinogenic effects of compounds like LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline arise mainly from their interaction with a specific serotonin receptor in the brain known as the 5-HT2A receptor. This receptor is widely expressed in areas of the cortex involved in perception, cognition, and self-awareness, and it plays a key role in shaping how the brain interprets sensory information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When psychedelics bind to this receptor, they trigger a cascade of neural activity that can produce visual distortions, shifts in emotional tone, a blurring of boundaries between self and environment, and altered time perception—all hallmarks of the psychedelic experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while the link between psychedelics and the 5-HT2A receptor has been firmly established, that connection alone does not fully explain the wide range of effects these compounds can produce—or their potential therapeutic benefits. Recent clinical studies suggest that psychedelics may help alleviate depression, anxiety, addiction, and other psychiatric conditions, yet it remains unclear which specific molecular interactions are responsible for these outcomes. Each psychedelic compound has a distinct chemical structure, and it is likely that they interact with many different receptors beyond just 5-HT2A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Classical psychedelics such as LSD, psilocybin, DMT, and mescaline have long been used for medicinal and cultural purposes. In recent years, they have gained significant attention for their therapeutic potential in treating several neuropsychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety, cluster headache, and pain,” said study author Manish Jain, a research associate at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Due to the burgeoning interest, there has been an unmet need for a comprehensive dataset for these compounds. Until now, available pharmacological data on psychedelics has been fragmented, generated from different assays across multiple laboratories, often with varying protocols. This patchwork has made true head-to-head comparisons between compounds difficult. Our study addresses this gap by providing the first systematic and comprehensive pharmacological profiling of psychedelics, delivering a unified dataset that will serve as a critical resource for future research and therapeutic development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin their investigation, the research team compiled a broad and chemically diverse library of psychedelic compounds. They started with a set of 255 psychoactive molecules that had previously been reported to produce psychedelic-like experiences in humans. These were identified through public databases and resources commonly used in psychopharmacology research, including Erowid, Wikipedia, and IsomerDesign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compounds fell into three major chemical families that include most classical psychedelics: tryptamines, phenethylamines, and lysergamides. Tryptamines include substances like psilocybin and DMT, which are structurally similar to serotonin and often found in natural sources such as “magic” mushrooms or ayahuasca. Phenethylamines include compounds like mescaline and 2C-B, which are chemically closer to dopamine and often have more stimulant-like properties. Lysergamides, such as LSD and its analogs, contain a tryptamine-derived ergoline (tetracyclic) core and tend to be highly potent and long-lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure they captured this diversity in their final analysis, the team used computational methods to compare the chemical structures of the 255 candidate compounds. They calculated what are known as Tanimoto coefficients—a mathematical measure of how similar two molecules are—to select a representative sample of 31 compounds that spanned the widest possible range of structures. To round out the dataset, they added 10 additional analogs from the phenethylamine and lysergamide classes due to their importance in those chemotypes, bringing the total to 41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then used a computational method called the Similarity Ensemble Approach to predict how these compounds might interact with proteins in the human body. This analysis suggested that the selected psychedelics were likely to bind to a broad array of targets, not just one or two specific receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their predictions about how these psychedelics might affect the brain, the researchers examined how each of the 41 compounds interacted with a large set of receptors. Specifically, they tested all the substances on 318 different human receptors known as G-protein-coupled receptors. These receptors are found throughout the body and brain, where they help cells communicate and respond to neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. They play important roles in regulating mood, perception, attention, and other mental and physical processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because LSD is known to have especially complex and long-lasting effects, the researchers also tested it on a separate group of more than 450 enzymes called kinases. These enzymes control many aspects of how cells function, and the team wanted to see if LSD might influence them in ways that could lead to side effects or unexpected actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings showed that psychedelics have a much broader impact on the brain’s receptor systems than previously thought. All 41 tested compounds strongly activated the serotonin 2A receptor, which has long been associated with psychedelic effects. But they all also acted on additional serotonin receptor subtypes, including the serotonin 2B receptor, which has been linked to heart valve disease when chronically activated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized this as a potential safety risk, especially for users who take psychedelics frequently or in microdoses over long periods. Importantly, activation of the serotonin 2B receptor occurred across all three chemical classes—tryptamines, phenethylamines, and lysergamides—suggesting that the issue is not limited to a few specific compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that most psychedelics strongly activate 5HT2B receptor, which has been associated with cardiac valvulopathy posing a potential safety concern,” Jain told PsyPost. “Therefore, we may need to design more precise, psychedelic-inspired molecules that avoid 5HT2B activation to mitigate cardiac valvulopathy risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that many psychedelics engage with dopamine receptors. This was especially true for lysergamides such as LSD, which showed strong activity at dopamine D2, D3, and D4 receptors. Some tryptamines and phenethylamines also activated these receptors to a lesser extent. Dopamine receptors are associated with motivation, reward, and mood regulation, and their involvement may contribute to the stimulating and emotionally intense aspects of the psychedelic experience. The researchers confirmed these interactions using multiple functional assays and radioligand binding studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adrenergic receptors, which respond to stress hormones like norepinephrine, were also activated by many of the tested compounds. These effects were again strongest among lysergamides, although some tryptamines and phenethylamines showed adrenergic activity as well. Because adrenergic receptors are involved in alertness, blood pressure regulation, and arousal, their activation may help explain the physical sensations and heightened awareness reported by many users of psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further understand the biological consequences of receptor activation, the researchers examined how each psychedelic compound influenced intracellular signaling pathways. They focused particularly on three types of responses: G protein activation, calcium signaling, and beta-arrestin recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most psychedelics showed a strong bias toward activating the G alpha q signaling pathway through the serotonin 2A receptor. This pathway is associated with increases in intracellular calcium and has been linked in previous research to hallucination-like effects in animals. The team also measured beta-arrestin recruitment, which can modulate receptor sensitivity and duration of action. While most compounds activated both types of pathways to some degree, the degree of activation varied widely between molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also compared the activity profiles of known hallucinogenic drugs to those of structurally similar compounds that do not produce hallucinations. One such example was lisuride, which binds to the same serotonin receptors as LSD but does not cause perceptual distortions. The researchers found that lisuride was more selective in the receptors it activated and triggered fewer downstream signaling pathways. It also showed a different pattern of signaling bias, favoring G protein activity over beta-arrestin recruitment. These differences may help explain why lisuride lacks the mind-altering properties of its hallucinogenic relatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another key finding is that, compared to non-hallucinogenic compounds, psychedelics generally engage a broader range of receptor-signaling pathways suggesting that their therapeutic likely arise from the simultaneous activation of multiple receptor-pathways networks,” Jain explained. “Importantly, this also indicates that it may be difficult to completely segregate their therapeutic potential from their hallucinogenic properties.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also explored whether psychedelics directly interact with TrkB, a receptor involved in brain plasticity that is thought to contribute to antidepressant effects. Although some previous studies had proposed that LSD and psilocin bind directly to TrkB, this study found no evidence for such interactions. In both kinase binding assays and live-cell reporter experiments, neither compound produced significant activation of TrkB. This suggests that the plasticity-promoting effects of psychedelics likely arise from indirect signaling mechanisms, rather than direct activation of neurotrophic receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To visualize how psychedelics interact with their targets at the atomic level, the researchers used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the three-dimensional structure of LSD bound to the dopamine D2 receptor. This structural data revealed specific hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions that explain LSD’s high affinity for this receptor. The diethylamide portion of LSD, in particular, appeared to stabilize the molecule in a binding configuration similar to that seen in serotonin receptor complexes. The researchers also used molecular dynamics simulations to confirm the stability of this configuration and to explore how different conformations of the molecule may influence receptor activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the researchers compared receptor activation data with behavioral data from animal studies and dose estimates from human reports. Compounds that more strongly activated the serotonin 2A receptor—especially through the G alpha q pathway—tended to produce stronger head-twitch responses in mice, a common proxy for hallucinogenic activity. These same compounds also tended to be effective at lower recreational doses in humans. These correlations suggest that laboratory measurements of receptor activation can serve as useful predictors of psychedelic potency and subjective effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We developed a comprehensive dataset for a large number of psychedelic compounds,” Jain said. “These compounds primarily act via activation of 5HT2A serotonin receptor in the brain, but they also activate several other serotonin, dopamine and adrenergic receptors. While most recent studies are mainly focused on a just few compounds such as LSD, psilocin, DMT – our resource highlights many additional analogs that may hold promise for clinical development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Importantly, our findings indicate that different psychedelics can engage distinct signaling pathways, which may contribute to their therapeutic effects. As the research on psychedelic medicines continues to advance, this dataset provides a foundational resource for the scientific community and will help guide the development of safe and effective treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study provides a broad and detailed pharmacological profile of psychedelics, the authors caution that their experiments were conducted in non-neuronal cell lines and may not fully reflect the complexities of living brain tissue. Receptor expression, signaling dynamics, and cellular context can all influence how a compound behaves in vivo. Even so, the dataset offers a valuable starting point for researchers aiming to develop psychedelic-inspired therapeutics that minimize risks while maximizing clinical benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study represents just the beginning of exploring psychedelic molecules,” Jain explained. “Our dataset indicates the polypharmacology of psychedelics involves the simultaneous activation of multiple signaling pathways. looking ahead, there are several exciting avenues to pursue, including mapping the complete signaling network of these compounds, crosstalk between the receptors, molecular basis of hallucinogenicity, and clarifying how these molecules exert their therapeutic effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In summary, we presented a detailed analysis of a large number of psychedelic molecules spanning three major classes: tryptamine, phenethylamine and lysergamides – at the level of receptor-G protein interactions. Our dataset reveals diverse signaling outcomes across dozens of receptors, many of which are linked to their therapeutic effects. This Neuroresource provides a foundational information to the scientific community that will support advancing the knowledge about psychedelics research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2025.06.012" target="_blank"&gt;The polypharmacology of psychedelics reveals multiple targets for potential therapeutics&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Manish K.

There are roughly a dozen species of kissing bugs in the U.S. and four in California known to carry the parasite. Research has shown that in some places, such as Los Angeles' Griffith Park, about a third of all kissing bugs harbor the Chagas parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It's why a team of epidemiologists, researchers and medical doctors are calling on the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:to label the disease as endemic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;to label the disease as endemic&lt;/a&gt;, meaning consistently present, in the U.S. They hope that will bring awareness, education, dialogue and potentially public health investment to a disease that has long carried a stigma, falsely associated with poor, rural migrants from bug-infected homes in far-off tropical nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"This is a disease that has been neglected and has been impacting Latin Americans for many decades," said Norman Beatty, a medical epidemiologist at the University of Florida and an expert on Chagas. "But it's also here in the United States."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"We had a kid from the Hollywood Hills who got it," said Salvadore Hernandez, a cardiologist with Kaiser Permanente in Northern California. He said the patient had not traveled out of the country and probably got it in his leafy, affluent neighborhood, where kissing bugs are prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The parasite has also been detected in local wildlife, including wood rats, skunks and mice in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7906329/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Griffith Park;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Griffith Park&lt;/a&gt;, as well as bats, raccoons and black bears in other parts of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Kissing bugs are pretty equal opportunity when it comes to who they take a blood meal from," said Sarah Hamer, an epidemiologist at Texas A&amp;amp;M University's School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, listing off a variety of animals, such as ocelots, bobcats, coyotes, birds, reptiles and amphibians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"That means the reservoir for &lt;i&gt;T. cruzi &lt;/i&gt;is pretty large," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;California has the largest number of people in the U.S. infected with Chagas disease — between 70,000 and 100,000. That's mostly because the state is home to so many people from countries where the disease is endemic. But it's also because the parasite and vector live here, meaning some of those cases could be home-grown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0013036" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:small study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;small study&lt;/a&gt; by the state's Department of Public Health, for instance, found that 31 of 40 human cases reported to the state between 2013 and 2023 — about 78% — were acquired in other countries. For the remaining cases, health officials couldn't rule out local transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chagas is not a reportable disease in California, which means the state does not require physicians and health systems to report and investigate it, as it does with influenza, Lyme and malaria. However, it is reportable in Los Angeles and San Diego counties; Los Angeles was the first county in the state to mandate reporting of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Between 2019 and 2023, health officials confirmed about 18 cases of Chagas disease in L.A. County, "although many more cases likely go undiagnosed," the department wrote in a statement. It said most of the identified cases were infected internationally, but some appear to be locally acquired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Gabriel Hamer, an entomologist at Texas A&amp;amp;M, said that confirmed human cases in the U.S. represent "just the tip of the iceberg" and that nobody really knows how many people actually have the disease. "There's no standardized reporting system.

There are roughly a dozen species of kissing bugs in the U.S. and four in California known to carry the parasite. Research has shown that in some places, such as Los Angeles’ Griffith Park, about a third of all kissing bugs harbor the Chagas parasite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s why a team of epidemiologists, researchers and medical doctors are calling on the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a class="link" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article" target="_blank"&gt;to label the disease as endemic&lt;/a&gt;, meaning consistently present, in the U.S. They hope that will bring awareness, education, dialogue and potentially public health investment to a disease that has long carried a stigma, falsely associated with poor, rural migrants from bug-infected homes in far-off tropical nations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a disease that has been neglected and has been impacting Latin Americans for many decades,” said Norman Beatty, a medical epidemiologist at the University of Florida and an expert on Chagas. “But it’s also here in the United States.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We had a kid from the Hollywood Hills who got it,” said Salvadore Hernandez, a cardiologist with Kaiser Permanente in Northern California. He said the patient had not traveled out of the country and probably got it in his leafy, affluent neighborhood, where kissing bugs are prevalent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parasite has also been detected in local wildlife, including wood rats, skunks and mice in &lt;a class="link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7906329/" target="_blank"&gt;Griffith Park&lt;/a&gt;, as well as bats, raccoons and black bears in other parts of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Kissing bugs are pretty equal opportunity when it comes to who they take a blood meal from,” said Sarah Hamer, an epidemiologist at Texas A&amp;amp;M University’s School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, listing off a variety of animals, such as ocelots, bobcats, coyotes, birds, reptiles and amphibians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That means the reservoir for &lt;i&gt;T. cruzi &lt;/i&gt;is pretty large,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California has the largest number of people in the U.S. infected with Chagas disease — between 70,000 and 100,000. That’s mostly because the state is home to so many people from countries where the disease is endemic. But it’s also because the parasite and vector live here, meaning some of those cases could be home-grown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class="link" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0013036" target="_blank"&gt;small study&lt;/a&gt; by the state’s Department of Public Health, for instance, found that 31 of 40 human cases reported to the state between 2013 and 2023 — about 78% — were acquired in other countries. For the remaining cases, health officials couldn’t rule out local transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas is not a reportable disease in California, which means the state does not require physicians and health systems to report and investigate it, as it does with influenza, Lyme and malaria. However, it is reportable in Los Angeles and San Diego counties; Los Angeles was the first county in the state to mandate reporting of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2019 and 2023, health officials confirmed about 18 cases of Chagas disease in L.A. County, “although many more cases likely go undiagnosed,” the department wrote in a statement. It said most of the identified cases were infected internationally, but some appear to be locally acquired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel Hamer, an entomologist at Texas A&amp;amp;M, said that confirmed human cases in the U.S. represent “just the tip of the iceberg” and that nobody really knows how many people actually have the disease. “There’s no standardized reporting system. There’s no active surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people find out they have the disease only after trying to donate blood, said Hamer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janeice Smith, a retired teacher in Florida, discovered she had it in 2022 after receiving a letter from her local donation center telling her she’d tested positive and should go see a physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith now runs &lt;a class="link" href="https://kissingbugalliance.org/janeices-story/" target="_blank"&gt;a nonprofit&lt;/a&gt; to increase awareness of Chagas, which she said she probably got in 1966 when her family went to Mexico for vacation.

                                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The 2023 Thundering Pickle Turkey Trot wasn’t Tanner McIntosh’s first 5K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That Thanksgiving morning in York County, he expected to feel sore, raise some money for the Dillsburg Area Soccer Club and move on his with life. But McIntosh felt a searing pain in the lower right side of his back. He finished the race and chalked it up to soreness, getting older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;McIntosh, now 37 and living in Lancaster, didn’t consider that he could have a brain tumor. Before taking on his current job, he handled budgets for clinical trials on oncology, the study of tumors. The issue was familiar, not personal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;His friends didn’t consider it either, including Laura Hartnett of Philadelphia. She has known McIntosh for more than a decade, since they were counselors at The Renfrew Center, an eating disorder clinic in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I figured it was just time to rearrange his stretching routine,” Hartnett said by email. “I think I was too naïve to think that one of my friends (in their 30s at that) could be dealing with a major health scare.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That winter, McIntosh went skiing in Maine. The feeling returned, worse this time. His primary care doctor recommended physical therapy, which he tried without success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I don’t even know how to explain it,” McIntosh said. “It was just so overwhelming and so not normal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In spring 2024, he started to experience back spasms. They progressed to limit his ability to move and talk for up to 30 seconds. He could only form words with a lot of concentration. His doctor ordered a brain MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The result showed a mass next to his primary motor cortex, the part of his brain responsible for voluntary movements. It also meant McIntosh was eligible for a special procedure at Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health: the hospital’s first awake craniotomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;READ: &lt;a href="https://lancasteronline.com/news/local/lcbc-bus-crash-survivor-elizabethtown-native-pursues-a-medical-career-following-recovery/article_a2674670-8c99-11ef-8080-836e625d7f5e.html" target="_blank"&gt;LCBC bus crash survivor, Elizabethtown native pursues a medical career following recovery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;Awake craniotomies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Penn Medicine, which parents a dozen hospitals and medical centers in Pennsylvania, performs hundreds of awake craniotomies every year, typically with the goal of removing brain tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Most of the brain is actually pretty amenable to surgical intervention because it participates in part of a network,” said Dr. Eric Hintz, a neurosurgeon at LGH. He compared removing a piece of the brain to taking out a single power line in Lancaster city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But when tumors encroach on territory vital for talking, moving, seeing or other important bodily functions, surgeons may require an awake patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;During awake craniotomies, doctors begin the surgery with a patient on a local anesthetic and remove a section of the skull, commonly called a bone flap, to access the brain. As the procedure goes forward, they wake up the patient to test their ability to talk and move as they stimulate various parts of the brain. If a person can hold a conversation or perform certain movements, the professionals know they’re on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Hintz had performed awake craniotomies elsewhere but never in Lancaster County. That is, until McIntosh’s primary care doctor referred him to Hintz’ team in summer 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;READ: &lt;a href="https://lancasteronline.com/news/health/thrivers-breast-cancer-support-group-unites-lancaster-county-real-estate-agents/article_48280edc-7d27-11ef-b78e-f72cea196d4d.html" target="_blank"&gt;Thrivers breast cancer support group unites Lancaster County real estate agents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;‘A good candidate’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Not everyone fits the bill for an awake craniotomy, even if their tumor grows in a precarious location. McIntosh didn’t have this problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Kind of all aspects of Tanner made him a good candidate,” Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;McIntosh was young and relaxed, and stood to benefit from removing as much of the tumor as possible. Anesthesiologists, who protect the airway during surgery, can’t insert a tube in the patient’s throat as they normally do. Patients need to breathe on their own, which requires some level of physical fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Plus, the candidate needs to be comfortable with having a surgeon remove a section of their skull and prod around in their brain while conscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“There are people who are so aggrieved at the idea that you can’t proceed,” Hintz said. He has had patients in the past decline the procedure for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;McIntosh, though, said he was willing. He had worked with Penn Medicine before, witnessing surgeries as a financial coordinator at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. He trusted the doctors. He didn’t want to wait for things to get worse, or for biopsy results to reveal that he might need surgery anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I didn’t have any hesitations about going through with the surgery, so ultimately, we just went with that,” McIntosh said. “Might as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Joey Fellenbaum, McIntosh’s partner, was present at the appointment at the Ann. B. Barshinger Cancer Institute when McIntosh’s care team pitched an awake craniotomy as an option. Even though McIntosh didn’t hesitate, Fellenbaum said he was in complete shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I have never heard of that being a possibility,” Fellenbaum said by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To prepare, McIntosh met with Dr. Jesse Main, a neuropsychologist at LGH. When something goes wrong with the brain, Main helps patients understand how it may impact their behavior and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Main set expectations for McIntosh about what an operating room looks like and the types of things he might hear during surgery. They practiced the speech and motor exercises Hintz and Main could ask Tanner to do during surgery to check his brain function, including basic finger movements without contracting his fist. In other exercises, he acted like he was using a screwdriver, and flexed his arms and legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Meanwhile, Hintz prepared by studying McIntosh’s brain so he could go in with the best understanding of the tumor as possible. That knowledge was especially important because once Hintz started prodding around during surgery, he wouldn’t be able to rely on the untouched imagery he had from the scans. The brain, he said, isn’t color-coded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“A tumor itself looks very similar to the surrounding brain,” Hintz said. “It gets to that point that you’re relying on that clinical judgment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="tncms-inline-relcontent tncms-inline-relcontent-bio"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;PREPARING THE AWAKE CRANIOTOMY PROGRAM&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Lancaster General Health didn’t acquire the tools to perform awake craniotomies overnight. Dr. Jesse Main, a neuropsychologist on Tanner McIntosh’s care team, said awake craniotomies have been part of the interdisciplinary plan for LGH’s brain disease team for some time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Dr. Eric Hintz, the neurosurgeon at LGH who performed McIntosh’s surgery, had previously performed awake craniotomies, just not in Lancaster County. The surgery was “featured prominently” in his training, Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Penn Medicine’s doctors in Philadelphia perform awake craniotomies more often — one of Hintz’ colleagues averages one every two weeks, Hintz said — so the LGH team went to Philadelphia to receive training and watch their awake craniotomy program in real time. That included the anesthesia team, who would have to closely monitor their patients’ breathing since, unlike other surgeries, awake craniotomy patients can’t have a tube down their throat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Tanner’s surgery was the culmination of months of work and coordination between us and Philadelphia,” Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;On the day of McIntosh’s surgery, members of Penn Medicine’s neurosurgery team in Philadelphia traveled to Lancaster to help make sure the procedure went smoothly. Dr. Nduka M. Amankulor, the head of neurosurgical oncology for Penn Medicine and the Penn Brain Tumor Center’s director, came to participate, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;The surgery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;McIntosh doesn’t remember much from the surgery in December, even though he was awake for half of it. He recalls mostly sounds. It felt ethereal, he said, like a dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;McIntosh and his parents checked in at the hospital by 5:27 a.m. Laura McIntosh, his mother, said she felt a bit freaked out by the procedure, since she didn’t know anyone else who had undergone it. McIntosh is her first born of four and was “the easiest to raise,” she said by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;LGH staff moved McIntosh to the operating room three hours later. He cracked jokes, met the anesthesiology team and learned more about the ideal outcome. He remembers it seeming like a normal, average day for staff. They administered local anesthesia, putting him in a stupor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With McIntosh’s scalp anesthetized, Hintz placed his head in a clamp with three pins resting against his skull to keep McIntosh’s brain from moving. The neurosurgery team used computer software to align scans of the brain and tumor with McIntosh’s actual head. Then, Hintz and a neurosurgeon from Philadelphia drilled into the skull, which Hintz said is a “loud, stimulating experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Then McIntosh remembers waking up. He heard clicks, people talking, Hintz poking around. He described “sloshing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It was pretty gnarly,” McIntosh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Main sat at McIntosh’s side, behind the curtain, to test the speech and motor skills they had worked on together. The tumor was on the left side of the brain, which impacts the right side of the body, so staff set up the operating room to allow Main to do his work from McIntosh’s right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Dr. Main, his voice is like a soft, velvety butter,” McIntosh said. “He just has this way of speaking, you couldn’t be stressed if you wanted to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As Hintz stimulated the tissue around the tumor with electrical pulses, doctors called for McIntosh to carry out the exercises and checked in on him. McIntosh remembers touching his fingers together, holding Main’s hand and making a peace sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Because he saw the movie “Wicked” the weekend before, McIntosh said he tried to sing one of the songs during the surgery. He doesn’t remember which one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I think I was talking so much that they didn’t even have to do any of the speech prompts,” McIntosh said. “They were like, ‘His speech clearly is not affected.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Although Hintz had performed awake craniotomies before, he said it’s always a surreal experience. Unlike when a patient is completely unconscious, Hintz had to watch his words to ensure McIntosh understood and didn’t feel uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The surgery lasted under five hours. McIntosh remained awake for about half of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“And I remember at some point Dr. Main was like, ‘You’re doing a really good job, Tanner. You’re doing really good. This is going to be over before you know it,’” McIntosh said. “And then I was waking up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;READ: &lt;a href="https://lancasteronline.com/news/local/manheim-township-high-school-senior-overcomes-hearing-loss-to-excel-in-marching-band-q-a/article_b99edc2a-90b0-11ef-a992-cf91fe11c288.html" target="_blank"&gt;Manheim Township High School senior overcomes hearing loss to excel in marching band [Q&amp;amp;A] [video]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;What came (and comes) next&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;McIntosh spent only two nights in the hospital after the surgery (&lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/treatments/awake-craniotomy-brain-mapping"&gt;Penn Medicine’s website&lt;/a&gt; says patients usually stay for five to seven days). McIntosh said he was both happy and nervous to go home so quickly. He experienced a lot of pain during his first few weeks of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I had 24-hour nursing care,” he said, “and then it was just me and my mom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;His doctors initially suspected McIntosh had a grade two glioma, a slow-growing tumor that can progress over time, based on the tumor’s rate of growth between MRIs. A biopsy of the tumor post-surgery revealed a grade three astrocytoma, “a fast-growing brain tumor made up of astrocyte cells, which typically support and protect nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord,” according to a release from Penn Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Hintz was able to remove between 90% to 95% of his tumor, McIntosh said. Hintz said he was happy with the result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It is always rewarding to open up those images and see the scan, and you did get the amount of tumor you were expecting to get out,” Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;McIntosh and his care team have a plan for dealing with the residual tumor and ensuring more cancer cells don’t return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After some time recovering, McIntosh underwent 33 fractions of proton therapy — a noninvasive radiation treatment that uses “high-energy protons” rather than X-ray beams to destroy the DNA in cancer cells — over the course of 6 1/2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After another short break, McIntosh started taking temozolomide, a chemotherapy medication he takes in the form of three capsules every morning. The cycles are four weeks long, with McIntosh taking the medication for five days straight before taking 23 days off. On his first day of chemotherapy, McIntosh returned to his full-time job as a clinical operations manager for ICON Strategic Solutions, a healthcare research and consulting firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;McIntosh will soon complete his sixth and final chemotherapy cycle. His back spasms, which turned out to be focal seizures, haven’t returned. He has made an effort to feel normal, even though he knows everyone is “dancing around the eggshells of cancer.” He has spent time with family and friends and kept everyone else aware of his goings-on with lighthearted social media posts (“Good news: I survived! Bad news: my head is still unusually and exceedingly large”). He has rooted for the Eagles, spent time with his golden retriever Cooper and visited Cape May, New Jersey, even though the heat of summer (usually his favorite) doesn’t help his nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the meantime, McIntosh’s surgery has given the neurosurgery team at LGH a new tool. Hintz has already performed his second awake craniotomy at LGH on a woman with a high-grade glioma, a case in which the hospital didn’t have months to prepare. Time was of the essence, Hintz said. The surgery aimed to preserve speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It’s nice to have available in the right instance,” Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Once McIntosh finishes his last cycle, another MRI will reveal whether the radiation and medication have done their job, McIntosh said. If they have, he will spend time recovering, figuring out how to find normal again. He will go in for more MRIs for the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It doesn’t ever not suck,” McIntosh said. “But it does get better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="tncms-inline-relcontent tncms-inline-relcontent-bio"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;MEMENTOS FROM BRAIN SURGERY&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For any future patients in Lancaster General Health’s awake craniotomy program, take a lesson from Tanner McIntosh.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I asked them if I could keep my tumor,” McIntosh said. “They said no.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Despite growing the tumor himself (as McIntosh described), most hospitals across the country limit what you can take home, especially when it’s considered medical waste.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“There are a whole slew of regulations about what to do with biohazardous material, waste,” said Eric Hintz, a neurosurgeon at LGH. “Taking tissue home is absolutely verboten.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While McIntosh got to see video of some parts of the surgery, Hintz also didn’t allow McIntosh to go home with footage showing his brain during surgery. Hintz said that’s due to concern that people could use video for “nefarious purposes,” including editing the surgery to look like medical malpractice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;McIntosh did get to take home the radiation mask he wore during his two months of proton therapy. Plus, he said the memories are his true souvenirs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Being able to retell the stories is a memento enough,” McIntosh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;div id="tncms-block-1010628" class="tncms-block invert-btn-primary"&gt;&lt;section id="block-1010628" class="block emphasis-h3   "&gt;&lt;div class=" card-bg-color"&gt;&lt;div class="card-panel panel"&gt;

I am in good shape and work out regularly. I had my prostate removed in 2023 after about six years of active surveillance, and I just finished radiation treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I've taken vitamins for as long as I can remember. I take Centrum Silver multivitamins, fish oil, calcium, and vitamin D for osteoporosis. When doing some research, I read that selenium and vitamin E are not good to take if you have prostate cancer, and they are included in Centrum Silver. The fish oil had conflicting information, with some saying it was good and others saying it wasn't good to take if you have prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Should I continue taking these vitamins, or should I stop? Could these have made my cancer worse? If I stop, should I wean off them or stop altogether? What are your recommendations on these vitamins/supplements affecting prostate cancer or my health in general? I would hate to think that taking them could do more harm than good. I eat very well (lots of fruits, vegetables, chicken, fish, and lean red meats). I drink green tea and lots of water to stay hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— Anon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Aono.:&lt;/strong&gt; Several supplements have been associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. The evidence is moderately strong with vitamin E. A large study designed to look for benefits had to be stopped by the safety committee, and an analysis showed a 17% increased risk of prostate cancer with vitamin E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Some studies found an increase in prostate cancer risk with fish oil, while others didn't. In my opinion, men with prostate cancer (or those who are at a high risk for it) should not take vitamin E. Unless you are clearly recommended fish oil based on your triglyceride level or for some other clinical indication, I don't recommend it either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Because your multivitamin contains vitamin E and selenium, another mineral that may increase prostate cancer risk, I recommend against it for any man with prostate cancer. There is no need to taper off it slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As far as diet, a more plant-based diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and healthy fats with limited intake of animal fats, processed meats and refined carbohydrates has been shown to improve outcomes among prostate cancer survivors. Lean meats are better than fatty ones, but I would still emphasize plants more. Green tea has speculated but unproven benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; I am a 78-year-male in overall good health. Based on certain symptoms (foamy urine and a previous eGFR of 55), my nephrologist has instructed me to have a metabolic blood test. Regarding the blood test, his instructions regarding the blood test were not to fast. I have never taken a metabolic test without fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;My research revealed that by fasting, your test results are more realistic. My research also revealed that by not fasting, one's creatinine reading wouldn't be affected. What should I do? Fast or not?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— B.E.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear B.E.:&lt;/strong&gt; Clearly you should heed the instructions of your nephrologist. Blood tests without fasting provide a measure of what your body chemistry is like under the most usual conditions. You are right that creatinine isn't much affected by diet, although heavy meat consumption will make the creatinine reading a bit higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Blood sugar and lipid tests are most affected by fasting, and while lipid tests are generally standardized to the fasting state, blood sugar tests need to be interpreted according to whether a person is fasting or not. Measuring blood sugar after ingesting a known quantity of sugar is the most sensitive way of diagnosing diabetes.&lt;em&gt; Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 09:03:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1AFBVV95cUxQYzJQcjFwOTF6UTRKbDQ3VFpQSkItMV9zSkJyZVRTYldaLW80YkFKY0tmQnpGZHZWMXd5WFc4LW8xaEVCVUcyQ1lGTHJMR3ZKZGJmUmRacjBYN3pDZFg3WnFXSXpoU2xWeFJaYjNmcWRkV3o1Rnlid0ZzTzNwc0lubmlyTW9xWjZkblMyZE5reGZJOHdqMUNGMUQ0NG80aEJ2NVgyYjYyVm5SRUFGZE14OEdLUmt5M29UZWRVWFFOeHBMVE9uaEVYQ2Fta0FUOHdKWXM4QQ</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员诋毁的疫苗方法正在整个SC进行临床试验，包括癌症疫苗- Post和Courier</title><link>https://www.postandcourier.com/health/mrna-vaccine-covid-hollings-cancer-center-clinical-trials-sc/article_175064a1-44e2-4438-b4b3-3524c4f59ab8.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the melanoma clinical trial at Hollings is no longer enrolling patients, a clinical trial using the same approach in non-small-cell lung cancer is still open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.modernatx.com/en-US" target="_blank"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;, which helped develop one of the two primary COVID-19 vaccines, has expanded mRNA use not only to cancer but also to flu, respiratory syncytial virus and norovirus, among others just being tested in South Carolina, the company said. Those sites are in Charleston, Columbia, Greenville, Mount Pleasant, Myrtle Beach, North Charleston and Spartanburg, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those clinical trials likely will continue, said James Chappell, president and CEO of &lt;a href="https://www.scbio.org" target="_blank"&gt;SCBio&lt;/a&gt;, which promotes the life sciences industry in the Palmetto State. It is the long-term implications that are troubling.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“It’s certainly disappointing,” Chappell said. Those mRNA vaccines are “really cost effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re much quicker to develop, which is why they were used,” he said. “You can change them quicker for new variants and strains,” which makes them adaptable to new threats.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The federal move take away funding could hamper mRNA work overall, Jenkins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a cancer perspective, I do worry that this might take away some of the momentum that has been building,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If U.S. officials aren’t funding mRNA development, other countries might be happy to step in, Chappell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If it’s not us, someone else is going to pick that ball up and run with it, and that’s a real fear that that we’re going to lose that innovative edge in the biotech space if we’re abandoning these great technologies,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;China, for instance, is “aggressively” pursuing some of these advances and seeking to become the innovation leader, Chappell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It just makes sense that could be the outcome, Talaat said, that the U.S. would lose its leadership not just in mRNA but in vaccine development overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The outcome was incident dementia after Visit 5.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;The study included more than 5,700 people, age 45 and older, who did not have dementia at the start of the study. The participants had an average age of 75. The research team determined if the participants took acid reflux drugs by reviewing their medications during study visits and during yearly phone calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;Of the participants, 1,490 (26 per cent) had taken the drugs. They were then divided into four groups based on whether they had taken the drugs and for how long: people who didn’t take the drugs; those who took the drugs for up to 2.8 years; those who took them for 2.8 to 4.4 years; and people who took them for more than 4.4 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;“There were 585 cases of incident dementia over median follow-up time,” the authors stated. The participants were then followed for an average of around 5.5 years. During that time, 585 (10 per cent) developed dementia. Of the 4,222 people who did not take the drugs, 415 people developed dementia, or 19 cases per 1,000 person-years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;Scientists found that people who take proton pump inhibitors, or PPIs, for four-and-a-half years or more were 33 per cent more likely to develop the debilitating condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;Dr Lakshminarayan said: “More research is needed to confirm our findings and explore reasons for the possible link between long-term proton pump inhibitor use and a higher risk of dementia. While there are various ways to treat acid reflux, such as taking antacids, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding late meals and certain foods, different approaches may not work for everyone. It is important that people taking these medications speak with their doctor before making any changes, to discuss the best treatment for them, and because stopping these drugs abruptly may result in worse symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;A limitation of the study was that because participants were asked about medication use once yearly, their use between annual check-ins was estimated.

It can cause severe illness and death in babies, who are particularly vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child, believed to be under the age of one, became unwell and died between March and June, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). The agency, which monitors infectious disease threats, confirmed the case this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, UKHSA deputy director, said: “Sadly, with a further infant death in the second quarter of 2025, we are again reminded how severe whooping cough can be for very young babies. Our thoughts and condolences are with the family who have so tragically lost their baby.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UKHSA has warned that vaccine uptake among children is now at its lowest level for 15 years. Almost one in five children starting primary school this week in England are not fully protected against diseases including whooping cough, polio, tetanus and diphtheria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, 11 children in England died during a whooping cough outbreak. Cases continue to rise, with 502 infections reported between January and June this year, including eight in babies under three months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates among pregnant women have also been in long-term decline. Uptake peaked at 76 per cent in 2016 but fell to 59 per cent by March last year. Since last year’s deaths, uptake has improved to 73 per cent, though this remains below the previous high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infection gets its name from the distinctive “whoop” sound that young children can make as they gasp for breath between bouts of severe coughing. It spreads through droplets in the air from coughing and sneezing, and can lead to pneumonia, brain damage, heart and lung failure, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the maternal vaccination programme began in October 2012, 33 babies have died from confirmed whooping cough. Of these, 27 had mothers who were not vaccinated, including the infant who died earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Amirthalingam said: “Vaccination is the best defence against whooping cough and it is vital that pregnant women and young infants receive their vaccines at the right time, ideally between 20 and 32 weeks. This passes protection to their baby in the womb so that they are protected from birth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that recent improvements in vaccination rates showed more mothers were taking steps to protect their babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 05:17:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxNNGFWbXVRM1REdWFBQ29iMDdEeFA0SkNSdFdkNnJLQ1I3SlRVc2JBN3ozWWlzRFlPMXppRkg1ZEFmREF1ZktONTN0VzhrMFZvNGFjczN1SWtkbjMwMlRLMkFGdUNpc1RjbnBTOGtsbU1EanhfeGd5dW5LTTg0WXVzT05ENmJUM0o2S1BoYUtoaUhEY2IyR2Vyaw</guid></item><item><title>9种水果含有比苹果更多的纤维- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/fruits-with-more-fiber-than-an-apple-11797285</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-generic" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apples are a good source of fiber with 4 grams per apple, but there are many other fruits that provide even more fiber per serving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fiber found in fruit can provide both soluble and insoluble sources of fiber that can help support heart health, gut health and even reduce risk of cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fruits with more fiber than an apple include berries, tropical fruits and pears.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With a saying like “an apple a day keeps the doctor away,” this fruit is known to be one of the most nutritious to eat. Apples deliver a bunch of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/17769/5-health-benefits-of-an-apple/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, from heart protection to brain health, weight management and more.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One reason why they’re so good for you? Apples provide a good source of fiber, with 4 grams of fiber per medium-sized apple (200 g).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But apples aren’t the only &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-fiber-fruits-to-eat-11747635" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber-packed fruit&lt;/a&gt; around. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend consuming at least two servings of fruits each day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The ones you choose are up to you (and your taste preferences), but if you’re looking to up your daily fiber intake, we’ve compiled a list of nine fruits that have more fiber than an apple.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber is present in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and whole grains. The two kinds of fiber, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soluble and insoluble&lt;/a&gt;, have their own characteristics. In the case of fruits, soluble fiber is found in fruits like oranges and apples, and this type of fiber absorbs water to slow digestion, helps &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-help-lower-cholesterol-8399539" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and may also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-for-high-blood-pressure-8769222" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;improve blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;. Insoluble fiber is present on the skin of fruits, like apple skin, and bulks up stool to improve regularity and lower the risk of colorectal cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Passion fruit is a tropical fruit that resembles a plum filled with edible black seeds. Each seed is individually wrapped inside an orange-yellow pulp. This sweet-tart fruit claims our top spot of the highest fiber-containing fruit, boasting 24.5 g of fiber for every cup (236 g).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Enjoy it as a whole fruit, or spoon the seeds and pulp over some ricotta and drizzle with honey for an easy dessert.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Guava has a crunch similar to a pear when raw. When ripe, some say the fruit has a flavor that is a mix between pear and strawberry, with a texture between an apple and a firm banana. What makes guava unique is both the rind and the seeds are edible, which contributes to the fruit’s fiber content of 9 g for every cup (165 g).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, it also ranks in our list of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-protein-fruits-ranked-8628266" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;highest-protein fruits&lt;/a&gt;. You can eat it as whole fruit or cut it up into slices. Also, use the ripe fruit to make sauces, jams, jellies, cakes and pastries.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Similar to raspberries, blackberries are a delicate fruit but with a deep purple color and a sweeter flavor profile. Each cup (150 g) is filled with 8 g of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Blackberries are a portable and convenient snack, but they are also an excellent hero ingredient for desserts, especially for blackberry compote,&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7898208/blackberry-crisp/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; crisp&lt;/a&gt;, jam, and cake.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Persimmon is a fall and winter fruit grown in tropical climates. Depending on the variety, this distinctively orange fruit resembles a tomato or a plum and the flavor can be sweet or astringent. Still, each fruit (168 g) has a whopping 6 g of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Their short season and limited availability make persimmons a rare gem during the colder months, where you can add them to our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7868597/bitter-greens-salad-with-persimmons-manchego-hazelnut-vinaigrette/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Bitter Greens Salad with Persimmons, Manchego &amp;amp; Hazelnut Vinaigrette&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Browsing the produce section, it’s hard to miss bright fuchsia or yellow-colored spiky dragon fruits. While their flavor profiles can vary depending on their variety, dragon fruits are seedy, juicy and pulpy. You can reap the 5.5 g of fiber per cup (180 g) by scooping the meaty and seedy flesh out of a halved dragon fruit, cutting the flesh into cubes and tossing it into smoothies or a fruit salad like our&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8023961/coconut-cream-fruit-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Coconut Cream Fruit Salad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to apples versus pears, pears have more fiber than an apple with an average of 5.5 g per medium fruit.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Whether you choose an apple or a pear comes down to personal preference, availability and cost. Our favorite pairing for pear is tied between our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269123/arugula-salad-with-roasted-pork-tenderloin-pears-blue-cheese/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Arugula Salad with Roasted Pork Tenderloin, Pears &amp;amp; Blue Cheese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269137/roasted-pears-with-prosciutto/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Roasted Pears with Prosciutto&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don’t underestimate this vibrant green, sweet and tangy fruit—1 cup of sliced kiwi (about 2 1/2 kiwi fruits) has 5.4 g of fiber (180 g).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Cut a&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/health-benefits-of-kiwi-8650515" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; kiwi&lt;/a&gt; fruit in half and scoop out the juicy and seedy flesh.

&lt;p&gt;Intensive efforts to bring down high blood pressure can lower the risk of heart attack and stroke, a new study has found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is a common health issue affecting an estimated 1.28 billion adults ages 30 to 79 worldwide. Left untreated, high blood pressure can cause heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;        

&lt;p&gt;Doctors often advise hypertension patients to take medication and make lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise and a healthy diet, to lower their systolic blood pressure to around 140 mmHg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systolic blood pressure is the higher of the two numbers in a reading, reflecting the pressure in the arteries when the heart is pumping blood. A level of 140 mmHg is considered high blood pressure, but it is on the lower end of the hypertension spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The new study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01391-1/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Lancet medical journal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, indicates that intensive blood pressure control – taking steps to lower systolic blood pressure even further, to below 120 or 130 mmHg – can reduce people’s risk of major heart problems such as heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings come amid debate in the medical community over exactly how low people should aim to bring their blood pressure. Some experts fear that aggressive blood pressure control could raise the risk of falls among older adults, for example.&lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese research team behind the study said it is the most extensive analysis to date on how this approach affects people’s health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers analysed data from about 80,000 people who participated in six clinical trials testing blood pressure control methods in China, Canada, and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;They found that across the trials, people who went the intensive control route – a combination of medication and lifestyle changes such as weight loss and quitting smoking – had fewer heart attacks, strokes, and cardiovascular-related deaths than people who were treated with standard blood pressure goals.&lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;Notably, however, the intensive control group was more likely to experience side effects such as dizziness, fainting, kidney problems, and abnormal heart rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggest there’s a “net benefit” to intensive blood pressure control, the study authors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They recommended that doctors take a nuanced approach that takes into account each of their patients’ circumstances, and said the findings “underscore the importance of individualised strategies to optimise outcomes while avoiding both overtreatment and undertreatment”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pecans are the top nut for lowering blood sugar, thanks to their fiber, protein, and healthy fats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wondering what other nuts lower blood sugar? Almonds, macadamia nuts and Brazil nuts are great options.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These nuts also provide heart-healthy fats and key nutrients that support overall health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Foods that contain fiber, protein and healthy fat are known to be a nutrient trifecta that can slow down the rise in blood sugar that occurs after you eat. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Nuts happen to have all three&lt;/a&gt;. “Nuts are big nutrition in small packages,” says &lt;a href="https://www.topnutritioncoaching.com/dietitians/annette-snyder" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Annette Snyder, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Managing blood sugar is beneficial for everyone since doing so helps maintain more stable energy levels throughout the day.

One particular study in the review included findings of lower fasting blood sugar in those with the highest intake of nuts,” she explains. Additional findings included lower rates of insulin resistance and insulin levels, as well as lower hemoglobin A1C (average blood sugar over a 3-month period) with nut consumption.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “When I consider the nutrition facts of a few different nuts, I would put pecans as least likely to raise blood sugar levels,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lenora-vatamaniuck-9b1b9324a/?originalSubdomain=ca" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lenora Vatamaniuck, RD&lt;/a&gt;. “Pecans have what I would consider a lower protein and carbohydrate content and higher fat content than several other common nuts,” she explains. Here's why:

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nuts contain a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595261/whats-the-difference-between-saturated-fat-and-unsaturated-fat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt;, which are considered heart-healthy fats. And pecans have more fat than other nuts—and that can be a good thing. Just 1 ounce of pecans (19 halves) contains 20 grams of total fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Dietary fats are an essential part of your diet. Your body uses them for energy, to build and protect cells, and to absorb important vitamins like A, D, E, and K. They also help your body produce &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/longform/7915557/hormones-spotlight/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;hormones that regulate everything&lt;/a&gt; from metabolism to mood.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High-fiber foods like pecans can help you maintain steady blood sugar levels as well. Fiber is a type of carbohydrate, but because it isn’t digested by your body, it can help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291843/these-are-the-fastest-ways-to-stabilize-your-blood-sugar-if-you-have-diabetes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce blood sugar spikes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Fiber helps slow the breakdown and release of carbohydrates into the blood—helpful in preventing rapid blood sugar spikes,” says Snyder.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;An ounce of pecans provides just under 3 g of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein breaks down into amino acids, not glucose, causing a minimal effect on blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; An ounce of pecans contains about 2.5g protein, making it a good addition to other protein-rich foods in your daily meals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; We love them in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252837/nut-berry-parfait/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Nut &amp;amp; Berry Parfait&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to pecans, our dietitians recommended several other nuts for their impressive nutrient profiles. If you’re looking for quality whole foods that won’t spike your blood sugar, here are a few more nuts to try:

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macadamia nuts&lt;/strong&gt;: Vatamaniuk picks macadamias as her second option because these nuts are high in fat and low in carbs, making them a great choice for anyone looking to avoid blood sugar spikes. One ounce (10 to 12 kernels) contains less than 4g carbs and over 20g healthy fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almonds&lt;/strong&gt;: Snyder recommends &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7631123/are-almonds-as-healthy-as-you-think-they-are/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;almonds&lt;/a&gt;, which are perhaps the most-studied nuts. And research shows that almonds, with their high fat and low carbohydrate content, are associated with healthier blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brazil nuts&lt;/strong&gt;: Brazil nuts are large, and just two contain about 1g carbs, which will have minimal effects on your blood sugar response. As a bonus, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/brazil-nut-benefits-8679701" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Brazil nuts&lt;/a&gt; are one of the foods highest in selenium, a mineral important for thyroid health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Getting too much selenium can be harmful, so consume no more than three Brazil nuts per day.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nuts are whole foods that have many health benefits, but they are especially helpful for people with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-have-insulin-resistance-8400321" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;metabolic diseases like insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; or type 2 diabetes. Even if you’re not actively monitoring your glucose levels, eating high-fat nuts like pecans during the day can be beneficial in helping keep your blood sugar stable. One word of caution: Nuts, including pecans, are a calorie-dense food. If your goal is weight loss, choose a serving size that fits your eating plan.

We’re really excited to see the ways that this can positively impact student achievement.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 1956, the National Science Foundation’s National Radio Astronomy Observatory established the country’s first observatory in the heart of the secluded community of Pocahontas County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Green Bank Elementary-Middle School (pictured), nestled beside the world’s largest fully steerable radio telescope located at the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia, has finally been granted access to Wi-Fi for the first time in its history&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Its isolation from the internet - and essentially the rest of the world - was enforced over 50 years ago to shield the groundbreaking scientific research taking place just next door (pictured: NSF Green Bank Telescope)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Because Wi-Fi signals use the same radio frequencies as the cosmic waves the telescope listens for, having active Wi-Fi nearby creates interference that drowns out the faint signals from space - making it impossible for scientists to do their work (pictured: scientists at Observatory)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Residents of Green Bank rely on landlines and face-to-face communication, with the surrounding mountains providing natural isolation from the outside world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who live in its secluded landscape often drive over an hour to reach a major grocery store - and even farther for a Walmart, the nearest of which is 50 miles away, turning each shopping trip into a 100-mile journey through rugged mountain terrain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was designed to serve as a home base for scientists from across the country, and the Observatory soon became the center of tightly enforced regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two designated 'quiet zones' were soon established, banning both Wi-Fi and cellphones use across vast stretches of surrounding land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the 'quiet zones' is the sprawling 13,000-square-mile National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ), which spans large portions of West Virginia and Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other, far more restrictive, is the West Virginia Radio Astronomy Zone (WVRAZ), enforcing strict guidelines within a 10-mile radius of the Observatory itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Green Bank Elementary-Middle School was founded in part by the Observatory, which also donated land to house the school’s library and sits within the 10-mile zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But back then, nobody could have predicted a future where education would depend on invisible signals in the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;For the first time ever, the tiny school of just 100 students received long-awaited permission to connect to Wi-Fi and officially step into the modern age once and for all&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In 1956, the National Science Foundation’s National Radio Astronomy Observatory established the country’s first observatory (pictured) in the heart of the secluded community of Pocahontas County &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When these Quiet Zones were created in the late 1950s, by the Federal Communications Commission and the state of West Virginia, officials could not have predicted the technology using radio wavelengths that are almost an essential part of our daily lives,' Anthony Remijan, director of the NSF GBO, told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The area became even more tightly protected with the construction of the Robert C Byrd Green Bank Telescope between 1990 and 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its construction cemented the site as an enormous scientific marvel, towering 485 at feet tall with a 100-meter dish to become the largest fully steerable radio telescope on Earth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Built to study radio waves from deep space, the telescope played a crucial role in groundbreaking discoveries - including detecting low-frequency gravitational waves and unveiling other major astronomical phenomena. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But because Wi-Fi signals use the same radio frequencies as the cosmic waves the telescope listens for, having active Wi-Fi nearby creates interference that drowns out the faint signals from space - making it impossible for scientists to do their work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its critical role led the WVRAZ to ban devices that emit signals - like Wi-Fi routers - within the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Green Bank quickly became one of the few places on Earth where people weren’t constantly connected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It evolved into a Mecca for people tired of the modern world and ‘electrosensitive’ individuals who believe they suffer symptoms caused by internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since then, the NSF GBT telescope has continued to operate around the clock, scanning the skies 24 hours a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Two designated 'quiet zones' were soon established around the Observatory, one of which being the West Virginia Radio Astronomy Zone (WVRAZ), which banned Wi-Fi and cellphones within a 10-mile radius (pictured) of the observatory itself - Green Bank included&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Observatory engineers and experts concluded that the best compromise - for the benefit of the local community - was to officially permit limited use of 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, since the band was already compromised by some unregulated signals in the area (pictured: telescope operator in control room)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Regarding the decision, Principal Melissa Jordan (pictured) said: 'This conversation has been going on for a few years, and it’s finally happening. Our students now have the same equal opportunities as the others in the county'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet over time, engineers, scientists, town officials and residents alike came to recognize the need to catch up with the rest of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Today, we’re trying to balance our scientific operations with the reality of a world with Wi-Fi,' Remijan told the Green Bank Observatory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For years, scientists have struggled against Wi-Fi signals operating at 2.4 GHz - the very same frequency they rely on to detect the faint whispers of the universe, as it's the most common and affordable band used by everyday routers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Many people who were doing the right thing by not using Wi-Fi were left without access, while others who were illegally using routers did whatever they wanted,' Remijan explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Observatory engineers and experts concluded that the best compromise - for the benefit of the local community - was to officially permit limited use of 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, since the band was already compromised by some unregulated signals in the area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now, the that benefits everyone and helps us better manage the situation,' Remijan added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The decision has been welcomed by West Virginia officials, including Senator Shelley Moore Capito, who praised the Wi-Fi access as 'a gift of education, inspiration, and knowledge.'   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Enabling the students this tool to expand their universe is a fitting thing to receive from the Green Bank Observatory,' Senator Capito told Green Bank Observatory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Those who live in Green Bank (school pictured) often drive over an hour to reach a major grocery store - and even farther for a Walmart, the nearest of which is 50 miles away, turning each shopping trip into a 100-mile journey through rugged mountain terrain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;There's something about the female brain that makes it &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-is-more-common-in-women-and-this-may-help-explain-why"&gt;more susceptible&lt;/a&gt; to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="172408" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that 'healthy', unsaturated fats, like omega-3, may partly explain that discrepancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to men, women typically have higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids, but in the current analysis, women with Alzheimer's showed a surprising dearth in these lipid molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-mysterious-molecule-is-crucial-to-brain-health-and-we-may-finally-know-why"&gt;This Mysterious Molecule Is Crucial to Brain Health, And We May Finally Know Why&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers did not find the same lipid changes in men with Alzheimer's compared to men without Alzheimer's, indicating that these fats may affect the disease differently based on sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings contribute to an overlooked hypothesis that has been around for decades, implicating &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprise-result-shows-mysterious-alzheimers-signal-may-protect-brain"&gt;fat droplets&lt;/a&gt; in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, these lipids have been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-hidden-cause-of-alzheimers-may-have-been-identified-a-century-ago"&gt;overshadowed by tau tangles and amyloid plaques&lt;/a&gt;; however, they, too, are hallmarks of the disease within the brain, indicating that fatty acid metabolism has somehow gone awry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent Lancet Commission for Dementia &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01296-0"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that 7 percent of Alzheimer's risk is attributed to low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23229-lipoprotein"&gt;carries cholesterol and fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This risk factor may explain why women develop Alzheimer's at twice the rate of men, according to the current study, led by researchers at King's College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team looked at the lipid libraries of 841 participants across six European countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to those with sound cognitive health or mild cognitive impairment, those participants with Alzheimer's disease showed significantly higher levels of 'unhealthy' saturated fatty acids, and significantly lower levels of healthy unsaturated fatty acids, like omega-3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study suggests that women should make sure they are getting omega fatty acids in their diet – through fatty fish or via supplements," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/omega-3s-could-protect-women-against-alzheimers"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; pharmaceutical scientist Cristina Legido-Quigley from King's College.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, we need  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="172408" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; to determine if shifting the lipid composition can influence the biological trajectory of Alzheimer's Disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172415" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172415" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/alz70512-gra-0001-m-642x819.jpg" alt="Omega-3 AD" class="size-medium wp-image-172415" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/alz70512-gra-0001-m-642x819.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/alz70512-gra-0001-m-325x415.jpg 325w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/alz70512-gra-0001-m-768x980.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/alz70512-gra-0001-m-600x766.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/alz70512-gra-0001-m.jpg 803w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172415" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Infographic showing the steps of the study.

In women, multiple lipids were associated with Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment. However, the same patterns were not observed in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to healthy women, women with Alzheimer's showed a decrease in lipoproteins with attached omega fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While this study shows that women with Alzheimer's had lower levels of some unsaturated fats compared with men, further work is needed," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/omega-3s-could-protect-women-against-alzheimers"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Julia Dudley, Head of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This includes understanding the mechanisms behind this difference and finding out if lifestyle changes, including diet, could have a role."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, there has been an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/grave-consequences-scientists-warn-of-extreme-bias-in-brain-aging-research"&gt;extreme bias&lt;/a&gt; in brain aging research. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29903-3"&gt;only 5 percent of published studies&lt;/a&gt; in the field of neuroscience or psychiatry analyzed the influence of sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, many drug trials for Alzheimer's still do not &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/men-and-women-may-respond-differently-to-latest-alzheimers-drugs"&gt;analyze sex differences&lt;/a&gt;, even when they appear significant on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is that scientists don't know why women are more likely to develop Alzheimer's, or what to do about it. While women tend to live to an older age, even older men are less likely to develop this type of dementia than women of the same age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding how the disease works differently in women could help doctors tailor future treatments and health advice," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/omega-3s-could-protect-women-against-alzheimers"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Dudley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At last, that research is coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70512"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70512"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When they become too short, cells can no longer divide and eventually die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/green-tea-and-a-vitamin-supplement-could-protect-against-alzheimers"&gt;Green Tea And a Vitamin Supplement Could Protect Against Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have linked shorter telomeres to some of our most feared diseases of aging, including &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/26/9/1381/71345/The-Association-of-Telomere-Length-in-Peripheral"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g4227.abstract"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40520-021-01944-6"&gt;osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28704792/"&gt;Smoking&lt;/a&gt;, chronic &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8920518/#:%7E:text=Stress%20induces%20secretion%20of%20glucocorticoids,to%20short%20and%20dysfunctional%20telomeres."&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-07076-5"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; all appear to speed up telomere shortening, while &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10522-025-10237-8"&gt;inflammatory processes&lt;/a&gt; in the body also take their toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beyond strong bones&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is well known that vitamin D is essential for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4781354/"&gt;bone health&lt;/a&gt;, helping our bodies absorb calcium. Children, teenagers and people with darker skin or limited sun exposure particularly need adequate levels to &lt;a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph56/chapter/What-is-this-guideline-about"&gt;build and maintain strong bones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But vitamin D also powers our &lt;a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph56/chapter/What-is-this-guideline-about"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.i6583"&gt;review of evidence&lt;/a&gt; found that vitamin D supplements can cut respiratory infections, especially in people who are deficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early research even suggests it might help prevent autoimmune diseases like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27644953/"&gt;rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27510600/"&gt;lupus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568997212001310"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, though more trials are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10522-025-10237-8"&gt;inflammation damages telomeres&lt;/a&gt;, vitamin D's anti-inflammatory effects could explain its protective role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172639" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172639" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ElderlyWomanLiftingWeightsWithPhysio.jpg" alt="Elderly Woman Lifting Weights With Physio Guidance " class="size-full wp-image-172639" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ElderlyWomanLiftingWeightsWithPhysio.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ElderlyWomanLiftingWeightsWithPhysio-600x318.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172639" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;It is well known that vitamin D is essential for bone health. (jeffbergen/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this recent study, from Augusta University in the US, the researchers followed 1,031 people with an average age of 65 for five years, measuring their telomeres at the start, after two years, and after four years. Half took 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily, while the other half received a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="172635" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that telomeres were preserved by 140 base pairs in the vitamin D group, compared with a placebo. To put this in context, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19666704/"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; found that telomeres naturally shorten by about 460 base pairs over a decade, suggesting vitamin D's protective effect could be genuinely meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't the first promising finding. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21986705/;%20https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33164936/"&gt;Earlier studies&lt;/a&gt; have reported similar benefits, while the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6316700/#:%7E:text=3.1.-,Consumption%20of%20Specific%20Foods,28,33,34%5D."&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; – rich in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25131600/"&gt;anti-inflammatory nutrients&lt;/a&gt; – has also been linked to longer telomeres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The catch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are some important points to note. Some researchers warn that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6715353/"&gt;extremely long telomeres&lt;/a&gt; might actually increase &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2300503"&gt;disease risk&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting there's a sweet spot we don't yet understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also no agreement on the right dose. The Augusta researchers used 2,000 IU daily – much higher than the current recommended intake of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7019735/"&gt;600 IU&lt;/a&gt; for under-70s and 800 IU for older adults. Yet other research suggests just &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5949172/"&gt;400 IU&lt;/a&gt; might help prevent colds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-021-00593-z"&gt;optimal dose&lt;/a&gt; probably depends on individual factors, including existing vitamin D levels, overall nutrition and how the vitamin interacts with other nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although these findings are exciting, it's too early to start popping high-dose vitamin D in the hope of slowing aging. The strongest evidence for healthy aging still points to the basics: a balanced diet, regular exercise, quality sleep, not smoking and managing stress, all of which naturally support telomere health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if you're deficient in vitamin D or at risk of poor bone health, supplements remain a sensible choice backed by decades of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As scientists continue unravelling the mysteries of aging, vitamin D's role in keeping our cellular clocks ticking may prove to be just one piece of a much larger puzzle.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263680/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;
