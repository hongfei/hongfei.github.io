The disease cannot be spread directly from one person to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-92bd15" class="body-graf"&gt;Since mosquitoes are less active during the fall’s cooler temperatures, the current risk of transmission is “very low,” said state Health Commissioner James McDonald.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc74c6" class="body-graf"&gt;Chikungunya is found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions, according to the state health department.

The only previous recorded instance in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; was in a four-year-old doe killed about a mile away in June 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts are warning of a domino effect on wildlife management if the neurodegenerative disease, more prevalent in western and north-eastern states, is not contained. Although not harmful to humans, it has no vaccine or cure, and spreads easily through animal to animal contact, environmental contamination, and ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="7dec8a41-62ec-4751-8a57-1735f45109e6" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘Kissing bug’ disease should be treated as endemic in US, scientists say","elementId":"7dec8a41-62ec-4751-8a57-1735f45109e6","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/13/kissing-bug-chagas-disease"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This disease right now is probably the greatest threat to deer and deer hunting in North America,” said wildlife biologist &lt;a href="https://sheawildlife.com/deer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Steven Shea&lt;/a&gt;, an expert in deer populations who manages more than half a million acres of species habitat in central Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Based on everything we know, CWD is going to continue to spread. Every instance where it’s been tried to be contained and eradicated has been unsuccessful. So really what agencies are trying to do is basically slow down the spread, keep it in a relatively small area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) has implemented a special management zone and program of enhanced surveillance and monitoring in Holmes and neighboring Jackson and Washington counties. &lt;a href="https://myfwc.com/research/wildlife/health/white-tail-deer/cwd/monitoring/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Test results are pending&lt;/a&gt; on 90 animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The disease is a so-called silent killer because an infected deer can live for several years without exhibiting symptoms. It will eventually succumb to brain tissue damage and experience a range of symptoms including weight loss, behavioral abnormalities, loss of coordination, excessive salivation, and eventually death, according to the University of Florida’s &lt;a href="https://nwdistrict.ifas.ufl.edu/phag/2023/09/08/deadly-deer-disease-found-in-holmes-county-implications-for-deer-hunting-and-management/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;department of wildlife ecology and conservation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The state’s white-tailed deer population is estimated at up to 700,000, with about 100,000 hunted each year, making it Florida’s most popular game animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;FWC implemented &lt;a href="https://myfwc.com/research/wildlife/health/white-tail-deer/cwd/regulations/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;special rules&lt;/a&gt; in the CWD management zone for the deer hunting season beginning later this month, including mandatory checking of all carcasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Florida’s early detection puts us in a best-case scenario for CWD management, as a smaller outbreak is more realistic to contain,” James Kelly, the commission’s CWD surveillance coordinator, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Hunters are our first line of defense in managing this disease. Each sample helps us track the spread of the disease and informs our strategies to manage it effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Shea said he feared a “domino effect” if CWD took hold in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Hunters have to send a head in for testing, they’re waiting on the meat, and if it comes back positive they have to discard the meat,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“So we’re fearful the number of hunters of white-tailed deer will drop. Hunters are the major way we control deer populations in many areas of the country and if that goes away you’re still going to have high numbers of deer, [but] there’s going to be bigger impacts on vehicle strikes, and crop depredation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Hunters provide one of the largest revenue sources that supports all fish and wildlife management in North America and if fewer hunters are hunting there’s less money that comes in to seed programs that help all wildlife, not just white-tailed deer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 11:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxOdGMzNU9qeGMtNTRVNV9LaldrMTlZWnZIZ2ZSYU16TGtQTGlMZG1qMEswZ2MwQWVhaFRsb0lMVGh4WFZGVFJUVUtENHh0bDFfMW5tUkdCeDZyX3owamozd0JjU1FNQ3BtejRLeVIweVZaSW9WQVB1UGZJYnJLSEVESQ</guid></item><item><title>呼吸道病毒季节已经到来。今年接种疫苗的注意事项- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/15/health/flu-covid-season-vaccine-tips-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            It’s that time of year when the leaves are turning golden, there’s a chill in the air and the threat of respiratory viruses like Covid-19, influenza or RSV looms across the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000a3b6nkhif38ry@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expects the 2025-26 fall and winter respiratory disease season to have a similar number of peak hospitalizations due to Covid-19, flu and respiratory syncytial virus as there were last season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl9njk900433b6nm6zkg8n0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But there are some steps you can take to reduce your risk of getting seriously ill with any of those circulating viruses this year – and vaccination plays a key role.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000b3b6nf0zieqeo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One question or comment I get all the time from my own patients is, ‘Dr. Ren, I got the flu vaccine last year, or I got the Covid vaccine last year, but I still got Covid, or I still got the flu. What gives?’” said Dr. Mike Ren, an assistant professor of &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com%2Fls%2Fclick%3Fupn%3Du001.rS6AFLs2KX-2FUfTmhUDQFOA50cagcI56HAvnRKrweh1IRC0ivJtGUIRQbGfaxNKF25I3C9oZjVVuBGm8YN0INaMPGkiVEywVn6RfQcC2CR2w-3D4_Zs_-2BfvDFm8rLlMG3DiFVwLpkkmQZ5tK1QI-2Bs-2FpJe6gRjYIK1XFj6zR1wY-2F1FgAYynw6UBk8Y7NcVJyGS0c5nHy9Y5PTJ0djCZZ5RXOaizvrcI6PZPb9G7M-2Bed4Vtc2WmnW92rOmh41TsdHxu-2BhstQFhezutmgGLl4ZGFTWax9eGF5TtHfHto8b8sKtzcQ4sZ662jPhK-2FuZk-2BxwcJxYbOdz3bOEhZHqS0e-2BNYCYMi0Yn2sydPhL36nEvnI7Rb0H-2FWzqd6Fe9N6wjadivEJCu2izqQmNsDHOaLjpLaIM75G6c4-2BnRN8bDu5BHPZ6ocaUpFmHcExU7JrTPlmEgPvRo9B0naGzOmCoav4izHEuZrwekHY2niR8HbERq2iyKYgO-2FO5TxERzYIKxF92zNWYsqEjNAXw-3D-3D&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjacqueline.howard%40cnn.com%7C735d35e1b3504200029808de073d941d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638956158217132134%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=PpEKJ3LbaWH%2FPnqPnXMwiZNVijD4RiEs1u7cbpzkLVg%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;family and community medicine&lt;/a&gt; at the Baylor College of Medicine.

            “What I tell them is, if I get the flu shot and someone with the flu sneezes on me and I’m in direct contact, I may still get sick, but it would be a much lighter version of illness,” he said. “Vaccines are not just disease prevention, but it’s to prevent you from getting a severe form of the disease that sends you to the hospital or worse. Flu every year and Covid every year still cause significant mortality in the country.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000d3b6n7514il12@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC estimates that about 1 million people were hospitalized with the flu last season, and there were up to 130,000 flu deaths, based on &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html" target="_blank"&gt;preliminary data&lt;/a&gt; from October 2024 through May 2025. Similar &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/surveillance/burden-estimates.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC estimates&lt;/a&gt; suggest that from October 2024 through September 2025, there have been almost 540,000 Covid-19 hospitalizations and up to 63,000 Covid-19 deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000e3b6n5xqk6f61@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s what to know about getting this season’s Covid-19, flu and RSV vaccinations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000g3b6naa395hje@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC says people 6 months and older - including pregnant people - should consult a health care provider to get an updated Covid-19 vaccine this season. It’s a shift away from the broader push in previous years for most people to get a Covid-19 shot.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000j3b6nt8uns5yc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The difference this year is that there’s not an explicit recommendation by the federal government to get the booster,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000k3b6nf1jnz2xn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This fall, the CDC has not explicitly recommended the Covid-19 vaccine but has made it available to everybody 6 months and older in a process called shared-decision making, which means that people are supposed to talk to a health care provider about the risks and benefits,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgld2jcb00003b6n069lgtyp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Types of &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001933.htm" target="_blank"&gt;health care providers&lt;/a&gt; may include people like physicians, nurse practitioners, pharmacists and physician assistants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000l3b6nqxyskqhf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are three types of Covid-19 vaccines available in the US: Pfizer for ages 5 and older, Moderna for 6 months and older, and Novavax for 12 and older. Pfizer and Moderna’s shots use mRNA technology, and Novavax’s version is a protein-based vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl99n1r001z3b6n74p073bp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This year’s vaccines have been updated to target coronavirus strains circulating more recently, and they are available at most pharmacies, some doctors offices and certain public health departments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000n3b6nfsubspc4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Many pharmaceutical places like your Walgreens or CVS should carry it,” said Dr. Panagis Galiatsatos, pulmonary and critical care medicine physician at Johns Hopkins and a spokesperson with the American Lung Association, who is author of the book “&lt;a href="https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/33262/medicine-greater-good?c" target="_blank"&gt;Medicine for the Greater Good&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000o3b6n3cc88o2a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before the CDC finalized the new recommendation this year, access to Covid-19 shots had differed from state to state as pharmacies and providers navigated new federal vaccine policies. CVS, which had previously limited access to Covid-19 shots in some places, said last week that it was “updating our systems to be able to offer the updated COVID-19 vaccines to patients nationwide” and that “prescriptions from outside prescribers will no longer be required in any states.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000q3b6ndtkw85sh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For people who may have questions about where to find updated Covid-19 vaccines in their area or how to get their children vaccinated, Galiatsatos suggested directing questions to their local city or county health department or finding a large academic medical center in their area where they may be able to receive the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000r3b6niyp72gvg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And what we usually say is to get the updated vaccine that usually comes out in the fall, get it once it’s available, and then talk with your doctor if you should consider getting boosted in about six months,” Galiatsatos said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000s3b6nnrcdocix@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Sarah Dupont, a family medicine physician at Emory Healthcare and assistant professor at Emory University School of Medicine, recommends getting the Covid shot in October or early November.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000t3b6nm89bttbv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At least a few weeks before Thanksgiving, to be sure you are protected over the holidays. If you have had a COVID-19 infection recently, however, you probably want to delay your booster as you already have a boost in immunity,” Dupont said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000u3b6nktyk4wft@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For most eligible people with insurance, vaccinations may be covered, but “a COVID booster at a retail pharmacy is about $220 without insurance,” Dupont added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgnx1p0000003b6njflxze5n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The nation’s largest trade association for health insurers said its members – which cover more than 200 million Americans – indicated that the new CDC recommendations would not have an impact on policyholders’ coverage through the end of 2026.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            AHIP, formerly America’s Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement in September that its members would continue to cover all immunizations that the CDC’s advisory committee recommended as of September 1 at no cost to patients. This includes the updated Covid-19 vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000v3b6n7lxqwcmi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last year’s updated Covid-19 vaccines were found to be about 39% effective against Covid-19 hospitalizations and about 64% against Covid-19 deaths, according to a study of US veterans published Wednesday in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2510226" target="_blank"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000w3b6n7ni4ie90@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The Covid-19 vaccines do a better job at preventing severe disease than they do preventing mild infection, and so people at higher risk of severe disease benefit the most from the boosters,” Barouch said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h4" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmgl9bqth002b3b6n78dxi0j2@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="can-you-get-a-covid-vaccine-and-flu-shot-at-the-same-time" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Can you get a Covid vaccine and flu shot at the same time?
&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl9bo6200293b6nyireglii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Covid-19 vaccines can be given at the same time as a seasonal flu shot, if people prefer to get both at once.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000x3b6n7o9ip1v0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s no recommendations against it other than just personal preference,” Ren said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000y3b6n5ot10d0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “With a lot of the vaccines, a lot of people may say they feel a little bit of fatigue,” he said of some of the side effects. “So if you’re getting multiple shots all at the same time, that effect could kind of compound.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro700103b6ntkajnr5e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most people 6 months and older &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;should get a flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt; every season, according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro700113b6nsotsl26b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For flu, there is no change from prior years in terms of guidelines,” Barouch said. “And according to the CDC, the annual seasonal flu vaccine is recommended universally for everybody 6 months and older.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro700123b6nk6f5cmir@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most people need only one dose of the flu vaccine each year. But some children who are getting the vaccine for the first time should get two doses, spaced four weeks apart.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro700143b6n9i03gf38@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It won’t be clear how effective this season’s flu vaccine is until after the season has ended. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-vaccines-work/php/effectiveness-studies/2024-2025.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC estimates&lt;/a&gt; that the vaccine was about 42% to 56% effective in adults during the 2024-25 respiratory virus season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro700153b6nysfbcb54@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Flu has a seasonality. That’s why we update it every year,” Galiatsatos said. “I usually recommend trying to get the vaccine at least two weeks before Thanksgiving, just so you can build up the immunity, because flu really kicks in in November and December and sometimes lingers into January, February, March.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro700163b6nc07hohfy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            September and October are considered generally &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/vaccinations.html" target="_blank"&gt;good times to get the flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC, and ideally eligible people should be vaccinated by the end of October.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro700173b6nswxe44mc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So get the flu vaccine now, if you haven’t already,” Galiatsatos said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro700193b6nark1k7ic@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some public health experts describe this as “&lt;a href="https://emscimprovement.center/news/flu-boo/" target="_blank"&gt;flu before boo&lt;/a&gt;,” an effort to encourage people to get their flu shots by Halloween.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001a3b6n4wvpchb8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is still okay to get it later than that (you will still get protection),” Dupont wrote in the email. “But it is better to get it before the winter holidays to avoid spreading illness among your loved ones.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgny55cy00033b6nrmwlzxb3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most people may be able to access flu vaccines at their local pharmacy, doctors office or even through certain public health departments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgo276k0000c3b6njhsvi9sg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But for the first time, many people in the United States who want to protect themselves against the flu can order a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/15/health/first-us-home-flu-vaccine-launch-flumist-astrazeneca"&gt;nasal spray vaccine to give themselves at home&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgo26brn000a3b6n81saf8g1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            AstraZeneca’s FluMist, the only nasal spray flu vaccine in the US that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, is now available for home delivery in 34 states under the brand name FluMist Home. It can be self-administered by adults under 50 and to children as young as 2 with the help of a parent or caregiver.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgo2byol000k3b6nacuqm10p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            FluMist has been on the market for more than two decades, receiving initial FDA approval in 2003. In September 2024, the FDA gave the green light for the nasal spray vaccine to be self-administered, but it wasn’t ready to reach the public in time for last respiratory virus season. However, the product is available for this season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001b3b6nnf3qoyp1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For eligible patients, the flu shot should be covered by almost all insurance programs, but without insurance, “a flu shot at a retail pharmacy may be as low as $30 for a regular dose and up to $130 for a high dose (which is recommended for those over 65),” Dupont said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgo1ryg600003b6nov98dipd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The at-home nasal spray flu vaccine option is covered by most commercial insurance, with an $8.99 fee for shipping and handling. The online ordering platform includes a brief medical screening questionnaire to be reviewed by a licensed health-care provider before prescribing the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001d3b6ntweso055@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            RSV vaccines are recommended for adults 75 and older as well as those ages 50 to 74 who are at &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;increased risk of severe illness&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC. It’s estimated that one dose of RSV vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/vaccines/adults.html" target="_blank"&gt;provides protection against disease&lt;/a&gt; in older adults for at least two years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001g3b6n578e71vr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Separately, to protect infants from severe RSV, immunizations can be given to mothers during pregnancy or to babies after birth as an antibody shot.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001h3b6nizgg8atc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you’re someone who is pregnant, between 32 and 36 weeks, consider getting it – because when you get that RSV vaccine, you’re going to pass those antibodies to your newborn, and they’ll be protected,” Galiatsatos said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001e3b6nx02zzjhf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The RSV vaccine is available for eligible adults at any time, but the best time to get it is typically late summer and early fall, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/media/images/2025/08/RSV-vaccine-chart-3272025_lc_08.15.2025_edit.png" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001i3b6nxlugjwcb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For mothers, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/media/images/2025/08/RSV-vaccine-chart-3272025_lc_08.15.2025_edit.png" target="_blank"&gt;RSV vaccine is usually available&lt;/a&gt; from September through January, according to the CDC. For infants, the antibody shot is typically recommended from October through March.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001j3b6nze2l3ar7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They should start getting it now,” Dupont said. “It is just a one time shot currently.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001k3b6n5m3zsx5a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For eligible people with insurance, the RSV vaccine may be covered.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001l3b6nvt6ko97s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Without insurance, “an RSV vaccine may cost $350,” Dupont said. “But there are patient assistance programs that can significantly lower the price if you are paying out of pocket.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001n3b6nwz25jooc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Outside of respiratory viruses, other seasonal vaccines may help reduce the risk of getting sick this fall and winter, Galiatsatos said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001o3b6nrznzx1xv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pneumococcal vaccines help protect against bacterial pneumococcal infections – including pneumonia – in older adults, infants and certain younger adults with underlying health conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001q3b6nnicozwq0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In addition to vaccination, people should stay home when they’re sick to avoid spreading diseases, and if people want to protect themselves further, then they can avoid crowded indoor locations during the wintertime,” Barouch said. “People also always have the option to wear a mask if they wish to do so, both to protect themselves and to protect others.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001r3b6nzsr749x8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu, Covid-19 and RSV can spread through respiratory droplets, Ren said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001s3b6n9dh66ye3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Good hand hygiene – so frequent handwashing and hand sanitizing – is really important because if somebody might have sneezed and then touched a door handle or touched that carton of milk that you were going to grab, as gross as it sounds, that’s how illnesses can spread,” Ren said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001t3b6nc9jeno5i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s also important to cover your mouth when you cough, “get plenty of sleep, eat colorful fruits and vegetables and/or consider a multivitamin to keep your immune system up,” Dupont said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

It also keeps out much of our medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years now, drug researchers &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-think-theyre-on-the-verge-of-breaching-the-blood-brain-barrier"&gt;have tried&lt;/a&gt; to use nanoscopic packages, called nanoparticles, to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-think-theyre-on-the-verge-of-breaching-the-blood-brain-barrier"&gt;smuggle&lt;/a&gt; Alzheimer's drugs across the blood-brain barrier.

Their ultimate target is 'endothelial LRP1', which helps remove amyloid-beta plaques at the blood-brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The long-term effect comes from restoring the brain's vasculature," &lt;a href="https://ibecbarcelona.eu/consiguen-revertir-el-alzheimer-en-ratones-con-el-uso-de-nanoparticulas"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; bioengineer Giuseppe Battaglia from IBEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think it works like a cascade: when toxic species such as amyloid-beta  accumulate, disease progresses. But once the vasculature is able to function again, it starts clearing amyloid-beta and other harmful molecules, allowing the whole system to recover its balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's remarkable is that our nanoparticles act as a drug and seem to activate a feedback mechanism that brings this clearance pathway back to normal levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease are proving tricky to find. The &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/latest-alzheimers-drugs-can-add-years-of-independence-to-patient-lives"&gt;latest drugs&lt;/a&gt;, which target abnormal clumps and tangles in the brain, have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/men-and-women-may-respond-differently-to-latest-alzheimers-drugs"&gt;produced mixed results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While drugs like lecanemab and donanemab can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-lifes-purpose-could-be-keeping-dementia-at-bay-study-finds"&gt;somewhat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://sciencealert.com/this-fda-approved-drug-slows-down-alzheimers-we-finally-know-why"&gt;slow down&lt;/a&gt; Alzheimer's symptoms, they can't reverse the disease or stop its progression, no matter how scientists try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-might-not-actually-be-a-brain-disease-says-expert"&gt;think&lt;/a&gt; we've gotten ourselves into a bit of a rut. They argue we've been too focused on clearing plaques and tangles inside the brain, when Alzheimer's may actually &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-may-start-at-the-brains-borders-scientists-discover"&gt;start at the brain's borders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julia Dudley, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, who was not involved in the current study, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-of-amyloid-%CE%B2-clearance-in-a-mouse-model-of-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it's too early to say if this strategy will work in people. Mice don't have the same brain vasculature as humans, and the current study only examined a very specific subtype of dementia in a small number of rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Dudley says the results add to growing evidence that "repairing the blood-brain barrier itself could offer a new way to treat Alzheimer's."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This type of research – while still early – is crucial for taking us closer to finding a cure," she &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-of-amyloid-%CE%B2-clearance-in-a-mouse-model-of-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-025-02426-1"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) — A person living in New York has tested positive for the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/china-mosquitoes-chikungunya-explainer-050e53750c8c041fc72b7cf62c01b92f"&gt;chikungunya virus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in what state health officials say is the first reported transmission of the mosquito-borne illness within the United States in six years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state Department of Health said Tuesday that the virus, which has been &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/china-chikungunya-virus-outbreak-control-measures-3ee97c21152b05ed0912af646594eafd"&gt;spreading in China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and elsewhere, was identified in a person living in Nassau County on Long Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county’s health department, in a separate statement, said the person began experiencing symptoms in August after having traveled outside of the region, but not out of the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear how exactly the person, whom authorities have not named, contracted the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the person was likely bit by an infected mosquito, but they also say the virus has not been detected in local mosquito pools and there is no evidence of ongoing transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The type of mosquito known to carry chikungunya is present in parts of the New York City metropolitan area, including suburban Long Island. The disease cannot be spread directly from one person to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since mosquitoes are less active during the fall’s cooler temperatures, the current risk of transmission is “very low,” said state Health Commissioner James McDonald.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya is found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions, according to the state health department. Its symptoms include fever and joint pain, headache, muscle pain, joint swelling and rashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The illness is rarely fatal and most patients recover within a week, though newborns, older adults and people with chronic health conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes are at higher risk, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and its territories have not seen a locally acquired case of the virus since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York state has had three other cases of the virus this year, though all were linked to international travel to regions where the virus is prevalent, state health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local mosquitoes can transmit other dangerous viruses, such as West Nile, Eastern Equine Encephalitis and Jamestown Canyon viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A student found the duck earlier in the week, according to the Hawaii Department of Health. Laboratory testing confirmed the duck carried the H5 subtype of influenza A virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirmation of avian influenza, or H5N1, is pending from the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Iowa, in the next week or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, officials said, the risk of infection to humans is considered low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Human infections remain rare and are primarily linked to direct animal exposure,” said health officials in the release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/avian-influenza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Avian influenza&lt;/a&gt; has been circulating worldwide, and is highly infectious among wild birds and poultry, with outbreaks on the U.S. continent affecting hundreds of dairy cattle herds in 18 states, including California.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza, so far, has been limited in Hawaii, which has had no human cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawaii’s first outbreak of avian influenza was &lt;a href="https://808ne.ws/3V1duhd" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;confirmed at Susie’s duck sanctuary &lt;/a&gt;in Wahiawa last November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Agriculture &amp;amp; Biosecurity confirmed that at least 10 birds on the property, including ducks, geese, and a wild zebra dove, died from avian influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 70 waterfowl, including some ducks adopted by a family at Pearl Harbor, either died or were euthanized in relation to that outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last November, officials also confirmed avian influenza in a &lt;a href="https://808ne.ws/3WCxRBP" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;wild duck&lt;/a&gt; tested at James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge in Kahuku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That duck showed no signs of infection when tested, and was swabbed and released by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service during an ongoing project on genetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, no new avian influenza detections had been reported in the Hawaiian islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH, DAB, and the state Department of Land and Natural Resources are monitoring health reports, poultry farms and wild bird populations for any signs the virus has spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The student had reported the sick duck to the Hawaii Wildlife Center, a nonprofit that saves and rehabilitates wild birds, including seabirds disoriented by artificial lights during fallout season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fallout season began in mid-September and lasts through mid-December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”As Hawaiʻi enters migratory bird season, this latest case is a reminder that wild birds may carry diseases to the islands and the public should remain vigilant,” said officials in the release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials remind anyone who encounters sick or dead birds to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Avoid touching or handling wild birds, especially waterfowl or shorebirds. Upon finding a wild bird, follow &lt;a href="https://808ne.ws/4om9aFH" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Report multiple or unusual illnesses in poultry, livestock, or other wild birds to the DAB Animal Industry Division at 808-483-7100, Monday to Friday from 7:45 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., 808-837-8092 during non-business hours and holidays; or via email at &lt;a href="mailto:dabic@hawaii.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;dabic@hawaii.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

You’ll still enjoy the same tacos and the same full plate, but making that substitution may help you &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7835958/habits-you-should-break-if-you-re-trying-to-lose-weight/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lose weight without needing to count your calories&lt;/a&gt;. In a six-week randomized trial, men who made that kind of trade—beans instead of part of their red and processed meat—lost more weight without cutting calories, and their LDL cholesterol improved too.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s the takeaway for the rest of us: you don’t have to eat less to make progress. Tweaking what’s on the plate—more &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8061834/healthiest-beans-to-eat/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber-rich beans&lt;/a&gt;, a little less meat—can quietly move the needle on weight and heart health while dinner still tastes like dinner. Let’s break down this study, which was recently published in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This was a six-week randomized controlled trial in Finland with 102 healthy men. Participants’ average age was 38. The were assigned to one of two diets:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Meat group: This group ate about 760 grams per week of red and processed meat. That’s roughly the average intake for Finnish men, and that meat supplied about 25% of their diet’s total protein.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legume group: This group ate about 200 grams per week of red and processed meat, which is the amount aligned with a planetary health diet recommendation. They also ate legume-based foods that matched the protein from about 560 grams of red meat. So, in their diets, legumes accounted for 20% of their diet’s total protein, while red and processed meat made up 5%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Apart from these provided study foods, participants kept eating their normal diets. Researchers collected food records and measured blood and urine markers at the start and end of the study. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By the end of six weeks, the legume group lost more weight (around 2 pounds) than the meat group (around 0.5 pounds), though participants weren't told to restrict calories. In fact, the legume group ate around 240 more calories per day. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/weight-loss-heart-health-study-11757537" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Body mass index&lt;/a&gt; (BMI) also decreased more in the legume group, but the difference may not be clinically significant. Total and LDL ("bad") cholesterol also fell more in the legume group than in the meat group, which makes sense since legumes offer more fiber and healthy fats. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finally, researchers found that the legume group’s &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-b12-than-beef-11776277" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin B12 intake&lt;/a&gt; and blood levels dipped but remained adequate. Iron intake actually increased overall for the bean group—though this form is less bioavailable than animal-based iron, leading to equal iron levels in both groups—while iodine status stayed the same between groups in the short term. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like all studies, this one has its limitations. The trial was relatively short at only six weeks. It also included only men. Participants self-reported food intake, which can introduce errors. Also, those in the legume group reported exercising more, which likely affected the results. Although participants in the legume group lost around 1.5 pounds more—consisting of small reductions in fat and muscle mass—compared to the meat group, there were no significant differences in body composition between groups, suggesting the observed weight change may reflect transient factors like hydration or bowel contents. While the design allows stronger conclusions than observational studies, longer trials in more diverse groups would help confirm the benefits researchers observed. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You don’t need a full dietary overhaul to see benefits—just make space for beans. Try these easy swaps a few times a week:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For tacos and taco salads&lt;/strong&gt;, use spiced black beans or lentils for half (or all) of the ground beef.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you’re grilling&lt;/strong&gt;, make a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7886300/chickpea-beef-burgers-with-whipped-feta/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;half-and-half burger&lt;/a&gt; with some mashed beans mixed into lean beef (or go for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8046362/best-vegan-burgers/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;a hearty bean patty&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sheet-pan-dinner-recipes-to-make-forever-8606756" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;weeknight sheet-pan dinner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, roast chickpeas with veggies and toss with a lemon-olive oil vinaigrette; serve alongside a smaller portion of steak or pork.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upgrade your pasta&lt;/strong&gt; and stir white beans into marinara for extra protein and fiber. Top each bowl with a sprinkle of Parmesan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For simple meal prep&lt;/strong&gt;, build a grain-and-greens bowl with a big scoop of beans, crunchy veggies and a simple dressing. Recipes like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chickpea-grain-bowl-with-feta-tomatoes-11742803" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Chickpea Grain Bowl with Feta &amp;amp; Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt; are perfect for this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Make beans the easy choice: stash a few cans in the pantry and cook a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8047812/how-to-cook-lentils/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pot of lentils&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend so they’re ready for you in the fridge all week. Beans play well with all kinds of big flavors, so let them bring out your culinary creativity. Add lemon and olive oil, a little garlic, herbs and maybe some spicy peppers. Bean-based dishes can quickly become something you look forward to each week.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In a six-week randomized trial, men who swapped part of their red and processed meat for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8060938/live-longer-fight-climate-change-eat-more-plants/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bean-based foods&lt;/a&gt; lost more weight and improved their cholesterol—without being told to eat fewer calories.

			&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the night, the world can sometimes feel like a dark place. Under the cover of darkness, negative thoughts have a way of drifting through your mind, and as you lie awake, staring at the ceiling, you might start craving guilty pleasures, like a cigarette or a carb-heavy meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plenty of evidence suggests the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-020-00879-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;human mind functions differently&lt;/a&gt; if awake at nighttime. Past midnight, negative emotions tend to draw our attention more than positive ones, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2015.10.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;dangerous ideas grow&lt;/a&gt; in appeal, and inhibitions fall away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers think the human &lt;a href="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/fact-sheets/Pages/circadian-rhythms.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt; is heavily involved in these critical changes in function, as they outline in a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnetp.2021.830338/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2022 paper&lt;/a&gt; summarizing the evidence of how brain systems function differently after dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-are-5-profiles-of-sleep-heres-what-yours-says-about-your-health"&gt;There Are 5 Profiles of Sleep – Here's What Yours Says About Your Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their hypothesis, called 'Mind After Midnight', suggests the human body and the human mind follow a natural 24-hour cycle of activity that influences our emotions and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, at certain hours, our species is inclined to feel and act in certain ways. In the daytime, for instance, molecular levels and brain activity are tuned to wakefulness. But at night, our usual behavior is put to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141228" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141228" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/AlarmClockWithPersonSleepingInBackgroundBlurry_R_U_642.jpg" alt="An alarm clock in the foreground with a blurred person in bed " class="size-full wp-image-141228" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/AlarmClockWithPersonSleepingInBackgroundBlurry_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/AlarmClockWithPersonSleepingInBackgroundBlurry_R_U_642-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141228" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Our species is inclined to sleep at night. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADEbULOUn4/"&gt;Motortion/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;From an evolutionary standpoint, this, of course, makes sense. Humans are much more effective at hunting and gathering in the daylight, and while nighttime is great for rest, humans were once at greater risk of becoming the hunted at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, to cope with this increased risk, our attention to negative stimuli is unusually heightened at night. Where it might once have helped us jump at invisible threats, this hyper-focus on the negative can then feed into an altered reward/motivation system, making a person particularly prone to risky behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add sleep loss to the equation, and this state of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/consciousness" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73104" data-postid="177488" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt; only becomes more problematic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are millions of people who are awake in the middle of the night, and there's fairly good evidence that their brain is not functioning as well as it does during the day," &lt;a href="https://mgriblog.org/2022/07/28/researchers-call-for-new-studies-to-learn-how-our-brains-change-when-were-awake-after-midnight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Elizabeth Klerman from Harvard University in 2022 when the study was published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My plea is for more research to look at that, because their health and safety, as well as that of others, is affected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the hypothesis use two examples to illustrate their point. The first example is of a heroin user who successfully manages their cravings in the day but succumbs to their desires at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second is of a college student struggling with insomnia, who begins to feel a sense of hopelessness, loneliness, and despair as the sleepless nights stack up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141230" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141230" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/PerspnStudyingLateAtNightLookingExhausted_R_U_642.jpg" alt="A person sitting at a desk while it's dark outside, looking tired and trying to study " class="size-full wp-image-141230" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/PerspnStudyingLateAtNightLookingExhausted_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/PerspnStudyingLateAtNightLookingExhausted_R_U_642-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141230" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;At night, our attention to negative stimuli is unusually heightened.

Suicide and self-harm are very common at night. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/neurologic/neurology/nocturnal-wakefulness-and-suicide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;some research&lt;/a&gt; reports a threefold higher risk of suicide between midnight and 6:00 am compared to any other time of day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7953996/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 concluded that nocturnal wakefulness is a suicide risk factor, "possibly through misalignment of circadian rhythms."&lt;br&gt;

Whether asleep or awake, the mind after midnight is a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnetp.2021.830338/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Network Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If this story has raised concerns or you need to talk to someone, &lt;a href="http://www.suicidestop.com/call_a_hotline.html"&gt;please consult this list to find a 24/7 crisis hotline in your country, and reach out for help.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in August 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                    &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health has confirmed a case of rat lungworm disease in an individual on the island of Kauai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rat lungworm disease, a parasitic disease also known as neuroangiostrongyliasis, is known to be endemic on all islands in Hawaii. The diagnosed individual had no history of travel to other islands, outside the state or country, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individual sought medical care after experiencing symptoms such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness and aversion to bright light. The Hawaii State Laboratories Division confirmed the diagnosis of rat lungworm, using newly available sensitive testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials, however, have not been able to identify the exact source of infection for this individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/rat-lungworm-neuroangiostrongyliasis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Rat lungworm disease&lt;/a&gt;, caused by a roundworm parasite called Angiostrongylus cantonensis, affects the brain and spinal cord and can result in long-term disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parasite is only found in rodents, but infected rodents can pass larvae of the worm in their feces, which can then be ingested by snails, slugs, and some other animals such as freshwater shrimp or prawns, which then become intermediate hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Hawaii, DOH said, most people become ill by accidentally ingesting a snail or slug infected with the parasite, but can also become infected via an intermediate host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said that from Jan. 1, 2014, to the present, there have been 102 cases of rat lungworm disease reported statewide — 78 from Hawaii County, 13 from Maui County, seven from Honolulu County and four from Kauai County, including this latest case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of cases, 84%, have been in Hawaii County, while the other 16% have been cases reported in visitors. The last case confirmed on Kauai was in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said early diagnosis is important in order to target treatment, and to reduce the long-term effects associated with this disease. Prevention is also important statewide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thoroughly inspecting and washing all fresh fruits and vegetables under clean, running water is the most effective way to reduce the risk of rat lungworm disease,” said Dr. Sarah Kemble, state epidemiologist, in a news release. “Small slugs and snails on produce can be difficult to see. Cooking food thoroughly also kills the parasite that causes rat lungworm disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH provides the following recommendations to prevent rat lungworm disease:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Wash all fruits and vegetables under clean, running water to remove any tiny slugs or snails. Pay close attention to leafy greens. This is important whether produce comes from a local retailer, farmers market or backyard garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Control snail, slug and rat populations around homes, gardens and farms. Get rid of snails, slugs and rats safely by clearing debris where they might live. Consider using traps and baits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Maintain water catchment systems and replace filters regularly. Cover and protect catchment tanks, as slugs can crawl up the tank and get into the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;                                
                                
                                
                                                                
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="23" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6t002d3b79sgqrerqk@published"&gt;I’m a 46-year-old, bisexual woman who is 10 years older than my partner. I have a ton more experience and kinks than him.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqs4qxu00313b790k8riv2r@published"&gt;I’ve had to let the kinks go because it’s not in his nature. He’s also small compared to previous partners. He doesn’t have a micro penis, but it’s below average. You could say I was a size queen, as I used to only look for partners on the large end of the spectrum before I met him. I was also non-monogamous for five years before him. I had girlfriends, boyfriends, threesomes, and moresomes. It’s been eight years, and there’s no kink, no women, only one threesome, and a small penis.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="130" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6u002e3b79bcif00ay@published"&gt;I’m sad about all of this all the time. The sex is OK, and he puts in so much effort, but I miss the feeling of a larger penis. I love to give oral (so does he), but it’s a bummer that I can’t even use my hands and mouth at the same time. I can’t give him the full experience. I don’t try to have threesomes because I’m embarrassed by his size, and he would not be OK if I dated other men. I plan to be with him for the rest of my life; he is the best person I’ve ever met. However, right now, it’s me and my magic wand against the world. I don’t want him to feel like I have to use it every time.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6v002f3b797bzw61pg@published"&gt;Is there hope for me? How can I stop thinking about other, bigger penises all the time? I’m somewhat OK without BDSM, but I need something. I also find myself craving a relationship with a woman. We don’t have sex very often, which might contribute to the whole situation. Lastly, I’m conventionally attractive and get flirted with all the time. That does not help. I wish I weren’t experienced and “freaky.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="3" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6v002g3b79qhzcjkrs@published"&gt;—Crushed and Kinky&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="4" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6v002h3b79erds0fih@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Crushed and Kinky,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6v002i3b799t6skhc8@published"&gt;There’s plenty of hope in several different directions. Our ability to control our thoughts is pretty limited, and mostly relies on mindfulness or actively thinking about something we want to think about instead of trying to push away the thoughts we hope to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6v002j3b79u2mvxcax@published"&gt;With direct answers to your questions out of the way, I have to point out: You sound pretty miserable. If you simply needed a place to vent, I’m happy we could provide that, and encourage you to consider who you might be able to trust to be that place for you in the future. You’ll want a friend who doesn’t know your partner, or at least isn’t socializing with them extensively, and who is able and willing to hold these frustrations without sharing them around town.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6w002k3b793rmp8gf1@published"&gt;Are you attracted to your partner? Your letter contained an extensive list of ways his physical attributes turn you off, and then a statement about him being the best person you’ve ever met, so I’m left wondering whether there’s anything about him that does turn you on but that you didn’t include.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6w002l3b79frhkurs0@published"&gt;If you aren’t attracted to him at all, in the sexual sense, could that be contributing to the infrequency of the sex you have together? I’m also wondering whether your description of kink as “not in his nature” means that you’ve made an assumption, and whether there might be more wiggle room there than you think. Have you given him the chance to decide for himself whether he’s up for any of the aspects of BDSM that you’re missing? Reading between the lines a little, men who are respectful, solicitous, and follow their female partners’ leads outside the bedroom often make great male doms with a bit of encouragement and support. What we might see as a man’s “nature” lending itself to sexual dominance can sometimes be an alpha identity or a more explicit tendency to be abusive. Give that some thought.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6x002m3b79j0ktdndg@published"&gt;Meanwhile, how much of your decision to stay with this partner is based on ideas about monogamy and vanilla sex being more “normal” or “better,” or in fear that you’ll never find a human as great as this one again, and, therefore, should rearrange yourself to keep him? If any of that resonates, spend some time with the friend I suggested you talk with up top, or with a sex-positive therapist, working toward a clearer understanding of what you actually need and want. It absolutely might be the case that you stick with your choice to forgo the extremely novel and varied sex life you used to have. Regardless, I think you’ll have an easier time living with your decision if you’re thorough about arriving at one.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqs650q003g3b79qlwvf12k@published"&gt;I have been with my wonderful boyfriend for a little under two months now, and I think this could be a lasting relationship. However, I have one problem with him: His dick is GIGANTIC. It’s both a length problem and a girth issue—it’s nearly as thick around as a soda can. Penis-in-vagina sex is possible for us, but it takes a ton of foreplay and lube to make it happen. Much of the time, I don’t orgasm outside of non-penetrative sex because it feels like I’m being stretched to the breaking point. Is there some way I can loosen myself up so we can make this work physically?&lt;/p&gt;

First, foreplay is fantastic regardless. Ideally, this foreplay includes at least one adequate-to-great orgasm for you, as that tends to help with relaxing the vaginal canal. You also might try very slow penetration at first, or even entering without thrusting at all, to give your body time to adjust.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqs6514003l3b79irakxu97@published"&gt;Speaking of time, you’ve only been having sex with this man for a few weeks, so your body might do some adjusting of its own over the next few months. And you can work on letting the muscles in your pelvic floor relax. Try breathing techniques that encourage physical relaxation, and visualizing your body opening, until you find something that works for you or get fed up with the process. But do give each practice more than a single cursory attempt. Most likely, you’ll need a combination of these tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

I really do not want to do this. Not only am I regularly left drained from dealing with two very young children, but the idea of a sex party taking place in an area where my kids play doesn’t sit well with me, no matter how good a job I might do of cleaning it. I haven’t given my husband a definitive answer on whether we will resume, but I know he’s going to be crushed when I tell him this is a chapter in our lives that I want to remain closed. Any advice on how to break it to him?&lt;/p&gt;

Your kids are going to get older and require less minute-by-minute care. They’ll start going to school for large portions of every weekday and participating in activities that don’t require your supervision in their free time. In a decade and a half, they’ll probably be out of the home entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

If you go to your husband with explanations for your decision that are fairly easy to work around, he’s almost certainly going to have hope that you’ll change your mind when the kids are older or if he finds a way to throw the party elsewhere. If you’re done with orgies for other reasons, get clear on that before you broach the subject with your husband and be prepared to share &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; reasons—even if it’s simply that you’re done and aren’t sure why.&lt;/p&gt;

The updated recommendations, published in the Journal of Human Nutrition &amp;amp; Dietetics and Neurogastroenterology &amp;amp; Motility, identify kiwis, rye bread, magnesium supplements, and probiotics as promising options for improving bowel regularity. These are the first evidence-based guidelines to focus on food-based management rather than medications. With constipation affecting around 16% of adults globally, experts say the new framework offers a long-overdue, science-backed approach to managing the condition naturally and improving quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is chronic constipation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constipation is typically defined as having fewer than three bowel movements a week, while chronic constipation refers to symptoms that persist for more than three months. It’s a widespread digestive issue that can cause hard stools, bloating, abdominal pain, and even nausea. According to the American College of Gastroenterology, constipation leads to around 2.5 million doctor visits in the U.S. annually. While anyone can experience it, the problem is especially common among women, older adults, and people with sedentary lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Experts warn that chronic constipation can take a toll on both physical comfort and emotional well-being if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best foods and supplements that relieve constipation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines recommend several targeted dietary changes to relieve symptoms and improve bowel function:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kiwis&lt;/strong&gt;: Eating three kiwis a day — with or without the skin — can help increase stool frequency. Studies show that kiwis contain enzymes and fibers that support digestive movement, though they don’t significantly change stool consistency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rye bread&lt;/strong&gt;: Six to eight slices of rye bread per day may aid stool frequency, though this quantity might be difficult for some people to manage daily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium oxide supplements&lt;/strong&gt;: A daily dose of 0.5–1.5 grams can enhance stool softness, reduce bloating, and improve overall comfort.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;keyword id="29506441" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="fiber-supplements" source="keywords"&gt;Fiber supplements&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: More than 10 grams of fiber supplements such as psyllium per day can increase bowel regularity. The dosage should be introduced gradually to avoid gas and discomfort.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Probiotics&lt;/strong&gt;: Specific strains like Bifidobacterium lactis and Bacillus coagulans may help balance gut bacteria and ease symptoms when taken consistently for at least four weeks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High mineral-content water&lt;/strong&gt;: Drinking 0.5–1.5 liters daily, especially water rich in magnesium, can complement other dietary treatments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why diet plays a crucial role&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although traditional advice often centers on eating more fiber and drinking plenty of water, researchers say those recommendations are too broad and not always backed by solid evidence. Eirini Dimidi, lead author of the new guidelines and associate professor at King’s College London, explained that many existing strategies rely heavily on pharmaceuticals rather than nutrition. “We realised that the dietary recommendations available were limited and lacked robust research,” she said. The new review aims to fill that gap by identifying specific foods and supplements that have demonstrated consistent results in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A step toward better digestive health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimidi and her team hope these guidelines will help both healthcare providers and individuals make more informed choices. “We want people to feel empowered to take control of their symptoms using evidence-based dietary strategies,” she said. Chronic constipation can deeply affect daily life — from limiting physical activity to causing discomfort and stress. By embracing these new recommendations, individuals can explore natural, research-backed options to restore regularity and improve their overall digestive health. Even small, consistent dietary changes can make a lasting difference—helping your gut function better and your body feel lighter every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 17:23:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwJBVV95cUxNaE80ZG1YZkRBSEk5Um4zNi1tVUxOMVYzUFl3dVo2MVhlY3N1Z2p4WDVlX2QtbHlpYmRyekU4TmVlaElPem5jeklFQnhvS0Iya2VXWmNGR2xJREVTMjZYaHJsV0FnaE5Udmx0WU0tQTREZE91cXhwd2tTa2kzQktVSXI0eEpkTHp0dV82MUp0LUt0YVQwNnQ1LXlSZ1hybTNTSWVhMlVJVnlhR2JYLWdPUjFGTDFzbG1VOEZUb1pFNUVLaEpYS1RKWUxjWndIVzhVclVYbDVEbzBkVjVkcXNwaThtTndjdUpiWXNROUZxOFdkVkVqdk93Z09mdTlTczhOR2t4NjdXbzNxWWFQZVMwQ3J4dW9pLU0</guid></item><item><title>明尼苏达州几十年来最严重的西尼罗河疫情造成10人死亡- Bring Me The News</title><link>https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/10-dead-in-minnesotas-worst-west-nile-outbreak-in-decades</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bring Me The News</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 17:07:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxOWDNfWGQxNlhnVHVWOEF4ZDdYSTA0aWRZdE1zbDd6ZjU2dFdPSVZxb3NYWVhRRzJFdjBsMHNZZWp4Sk5RNnNwV19vTTR6U29fZURIcFdmZFBqZXpySUl3Z0c0TUVVRllVbVZzV21HZlVSdXkwZk1MTU5iY2lfbmt1LW9IWWs2ZWFzZUx2aDdYZHBPbnp2WC1yMEMtOUo0S0Jf</guid></item><item><title>医生恳求乘客不要在车上犯同样不必要的错误……这可能会让你付出生命的代价--《每日邮报》</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15191127/Emergency-room-doctors-mistake-car-crash-accident.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors in the emergency room are issuing an urgent warning to car passengers who get too comfortable in their seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many passengers instinctively prop their feet on the dashboard to sit back and relax during a road trip, often without considering the potential dangers of this seemingly harmless habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But placing one’s feet on the dashboard is extremely dangerous. In a sudden stop, the body continues moving forward with the car's momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If feet are on the dashboard, this can force the legs into a position that causes severe &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-7924629/Womans-hips-crushed-crash-propped-feet-dashboard.html"&gt;injuries like hip breaks&lt;/a&gt;, bone fractures and joint dislocations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, airbags deploy with tremendous force during a collision. If a passenger's feet are on the dashboard, the airbag can impact the legs with enough power to cause fractures, dislocations, and other severe injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The seat belt is the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14430187/Doctors-dangers-not-wearing-seatbelt.html"&gt;primary defense in a crash&lt;/a&gt;, but this safety measure is compromised when feet are on the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this position, the seat belt cannot properly restrain the passenger, increasing the risk of being thrown forward. This can lead to severe head injuries, broken bones or even ejection from the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Feet on the dashboard also impedes a passenger's reaction time, preventing them from bracing quickly for sudden stops or obstacles and endangering all occupants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Feet on the dashboard prevents the seatbelt from properly restraining a passenger, dramatically increasing the risk of severe injury or ejection in a crash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Solomon Behar, a pediatric emergency medicine physician at Miller Children’s &amp;amp; Women’s Hospital in Long Beach, California, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.aol.com/articles/er-docs-want-people-stop-145000250.html"&gt;Parade &lt;/a&gt;magazine: ‘I do a lot of driving on Los Angeles freeways, and one of the things that makes me cringe is when I pass a passenger who has their feet up on the dashboard.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Placing feet on the dashboard fundamentally alters the passenger's posture and, consequently, the function of the seatbelt, creating a cascade of failure points in the event of a collision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Behar added: ‘[Sitting upright with feed on the floor is safest because] it allows the seat belt and airbag systems to function as they were supposed to, distributing the forces more evenly and actually reducing the risk of drying your legs and pelvis.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During a frontal collision, the body will pivot at the waist and slide underneath the lap belt, which allows the lower body to thrust forward while the upper body is unrestrained, dramatically increasing the risk of severe internal abdominal injuries and spinal damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the car stops or slams into another vehicle in front, the head, torso and lower body are all thrown forward with the car’s momentum, but the locked seatbelt restrains the torso. Meanwhile, the lower body continues to move forward violently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The knees, already pressed against the dashboard, become a pivot point while the dashboard stops the lower legs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thigh bones are the long, strong levers that concentrate immense force on the hips and knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can lead to a fracture of the socket of the hip joint in the pelvis, which endangers the entire structure of the hip and often requires extensive reconstructive surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Based on 2019-2020 data, the most recent data published by the CDC, the rate of emergency department visits for car crashes varied significantly by age, averaging 11.6 visits per 1,000 people annually. The rate peaked at 19.1 for young adults aged 15-24&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The long thigh bone can snap near the hip or just above the knee from the bending stress and the kneecap can be shattered as it is crushed between the femur and the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jacob Snow, a pediatric emergency room specialist at Pediatrix Medical Group in Las Vegas, Nevada, said: ‘Cars are designed to protect passengers seated with their feet on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It prevents the risk of your legs buckling or being pushed back into your face by the dash itself or the airbags.

If a passenger's feet are on the dashboard at the moment of deployment, the explosive force can drive their knees backward with enough violence to cause severe facial and head trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Snow added: ‘There is always some risk of being involved in a car accident every time you ride or drive. Riding with your feet on the dash adds unnecessary risk.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 16:18:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOcVFnMWJHUHpSS24xY0tJdVFLX3dWbGdSYV9Sc0dWczFMMnhMTWhQbnY2X1lYYmp2a2pFdUZoQWJUNEZobUxBMzJSMUlKanNtcXo3X09Fd0pIWVZNRkFnOUwxV2k0Sm1BQmxTT2ZPbXViUWU1Q2NsSW01a004bzhIWmNyc1dJbllwYlBYUDY5bmJtbTRCb3Y0anZGSkVnaHEyaWUxc2xPYVJfd9IBrwFBVV95cUxQa2tfb3ljcjE5NG5nR0pWRE91eC1lODJuMER1c2xUOGdYd2xmV3BBMWNJc01aeGhab3RaUTJvbWcyOWdta1ROUmF1WURCMjhlSFhzNXB5RnZXRjB4ZGtJRllNRFlLekZtRzNRNDgweDJsLTMzMzRlQ2N3eXB5MFFVS2ZlMGNTM3dOTUs2cHVIb1JWZEV1WmVKaWNtUjM5M2xDU09OMmZFTFBkVzlqMFlF</guid></item><item><title>南非卫生部长对新的艾滋病预防接种表示欢迎，但警告供应有限- ABC新闻-突发新闻、最新新闻和视频</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/south-africas-health-minister-hails-new-hiv-prevention-126514241</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;&lt;span class="oyrPY qlwaB AGxeB  "&gt;JOHANNESBURG -- &lt;/span&gt;JOHANNESBURG (AP) — South Africa's health minister on Tuesday called &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/hiv-prevention-shot-lenacapavir-gilead-80fb37e2c5ac9b452488d7b86a10d568"&gt;lenacapavir,&lt;/a&gt; the first twice-yearly HIV prevention jab in the world, a “groundbreaking” tool to fight the disease, but warned initial donated supply would be limited to nearly half a million people in the African country with the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/hub/hiv-and-aids"&gt;highest prevalence rate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This comes just weeks after the U.S. announced plans to buy &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/hiv-prevention-lenacapavir-trump-pepfar-e85c9b8772141722fccc4b7b349ef809"&gt;2 million doses of the HIV prevention drug&lt;/a&gt; for low-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The initial supply in South Africa is set to begin in April 2026, funded by a $29.2 million Global Fund grant with an additional $5 million allocated by the Networking HIV and AIDS Community of Southern Africa (NACOSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Addressing a national healthcare roundtable dialogue in Johannesburg, Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said the Global Funds’ catalytic commitment will deliver around 456,000 lenacapavir initiations over two years, translating into 912,000 doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“We plan to roll out lenacapavir initially in about 23 high-incident districts across six provinces, targeting around 360 high-performing public clinics within these areas for phase one implementation,” said the minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“About half a million people will be able to begin using lenacapavir, and thanks to this support, but demand will likely outstrip supply at first,” said Motsoaledi, highlighting that research data suggested that prioritizing vulnerable populations in high-burden districts first would result in the highest impact in terms of new infections prevented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The minister was quick to caution against complacency with the initial investment after South Africa’s health system was significantly hit by the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-agency-for-international-development"&gt;abrupt cuts to funding&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-trump-pepfar-hiv-aid-freeze-0d9def2a63b0e2f53bfda9441baf584d"&gt;USAID and other U.S. government sources&lt;/a&gt; in early 2025. These cuts have had a severe impact on HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB) treatment, prevention, and research programs across the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Although Motsoaledi expressed gratitude that Gilead had lowered the price from the $28,000, initially touted to $40, per person annually, he said that South Africa aimed to fund its program independently, with long-term funding hinging on lenacapavir’s integration into local systems, such as the essential medicines list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The World Health Organization in July recommended the six-month HIV prevention jab that’s already &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/hiv-drug-injectable-ema-europe-approval-6c60e9dc07776af2af88ee121e015e2b"&gt;approved in the U.S. and Europe&lt;/a&gt;, as an additional prevention choice as part of combination approaches. Gilead is expediting registration in 18 high-incidence countries, including South Africa, to deliver lenacapavir until generic versions become available in 2027. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Early in October, Gilead Sciences announced it had executed voluntary, non-exclusive, royalty-free license contracts with six pharmaceutical companies in Egypt, Pakistan, and India to produce and market generic lenacapavir. Despite participating in the clinical trials for the drug in recent years, South African companies were excluded from Gilead Sciences’ voluntary licensing, which has infuriated civil society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“This is not the principle of ubuntu,” said Sheila Mbele-Khama, in reference to the South African philosophy that values principles such as human dignity and fairness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Mbele-Khama, speaking on behalf of the South African National Aids Council (SANAC), claimed during the roundtable that one out of every four new HIV infections took place in the 26 nations that Gilead didn’t give licenses to. “You can’t come in the house to ask us to allow you to learn and then you run away, you no longer include us”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;According to Wendy Cupido, country manager for Gilead, the South African manufacturers that were evaluated in 2024 did not satisfy the technical specifications for the production of sterile injectables at that time. She said, though, that Gilead was still willing to look at further voluntary licensing if a South African manufacturer could develop the required capabilities and meet quality standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Welcoming the over $34 million in investment into the rollout, UNAIDS South Africa country director Eva Kiwango said at a time when foreign assistance funding cuts could lead to an additional 6 million HIV infections globally by 2029, long-acting injectable medicines were a “fresh option for all people at risk,”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“It is not a cure or a vaccine, but it could be a game changer if made accessible to all who could benefit,” said Kiwango. “For many, lenacapavir expands choice, strengthens agency, and reduces barriers linked to stigma, disclosure, or daily adherence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The roundtable is a two-day event that will conclude on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For more on Africa and development: &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse"&gt;https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

After our interview, she said she was going to go for a walk, to enjoy the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;unseasonably warm weather in San Anselmo, just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she's not at the gym with clients or working out herself, she's at the local humane society, where she teaches a range of classes, including basic obedience and canine exercise. She helps&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;old dogs age gracefully and works&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;with four-legged athletes in agility or diving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing about longevity, I speak to a lot of senior athletes. And yet, I'm struck by Mimms' remarkably youthful energy; she appears decades younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She started dancing at age 12, training in ballet at first, and later fell in love with &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/20-dance-styles-from-around-the-world" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;modern dance.&lt;/a&gt; Mimms initially had a career in the restaurant industry before returning to the studio, ultimately training to teach&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;dance and, later, fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, she keeps in shape (and puts off retirement), to inspire others, and offered three &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-lessons-100-year-old-woman-lift-weights-2025-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;longevity tips&lt;/a&gt; for staying spry over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you can breathe, you can move," she said.

She added that it helps that she never married or had children, giving her more time for her own interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While research is mixed on how marriage and childbearing impact longevity, it's likely that she had genetics on her side.

These days, she focuses more on exercises like cable rows, wood chops, lunges, and kettlebell lifts or swings. A typical session is a circuit-style workout of these exercises for about three rounds each, or 30 minutes total, adding up to about three hours a week of strength training.&lt;/p&gt;

The tongue thing persisted, but didn't get worse," he says. But by the time winter rolled around, Greene noticed his &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/womens-health/npr-mary-louise-kelly-hearing-loss-rcna78925" target="_blank"&gt;hearing had gotten significantly worse&lt;/a&gt; in that ear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-865ab6" class="body-graf"&gt;Greene and his wife go out to dinner once a week, and he'd started to notice that, "if I was not on her right side, I couldn't hear the conversation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e22e94" class="body-graf"&gt;At that point, he says, "I realized my hearing was going on the right side, and at the same time, that numbness was spreading to my cheek area from just the tongue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dbc712" class="body-graf"&gt;This time, his doctor sent him to a different ENT, who suspected the issue may be brain-related and recommended Greene get an MRI and see a neurologist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3dc3ac" class="body-graf"&gt;On April 11, 2025, almost exactly a year after his symptoms first began, Greene went for the brain MRI, which confirmed that the issue was neurological: Greene had a nearly golf ball-sized tumor pressing on the nerves responsible for hearing and facial sensations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-99b6c7" class="body-heading"&gt;An MRI Revealed a Brain Tumor &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f39adf" class="body-graf"&gt;Greene was diagnosed with a vestibular schwannoma, a type of non-cancerous tumor that grows out of the lining of a nerve in the inner ear, Dr. Omar Arnaout, a neurosurgeon who specializes in treating these tumors at Mass General Brigham, tells TODAY.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5efe4" class="body-graf"&gt;Specifically, the tumor develops from Schwann cells, which form the insulated lining of the vestibular nerves that are responsible for balance. But the vestibular nerves share that small inner ear canal with other nerves, including those responsible for hearing and facial sensations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eb3f04" class="body-graf"&gt;Of those nerves, the hearing nerve "is very fragile," Arnaout explains. "It's the most sensitive." So, a tumor that grows on the vestibular nerve is likely to press on the hearing nerve and cause symptoms there first, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cae1cf" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, the symptoms of a &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/what-acoustic-neuroma-dad-35-diagnosed-brain-tumor-t216069" target="_blank"&gt;vestibular schwannoma&lt;/a&gt; (also called a vestibular neuroma) tend to be less dramatic than those of other brain tumors, like &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/mom-severe-headaches-brain-tumor-rcna95149" target="_blank"&gt;glioblastomas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-73f6e0" class="body-graf"&gt;“These are slow-growing, benign tumors, and the symptoms tend to be pretty subtle," Arnaout explains. "So it’s very common for people to go a while before they get diagnosed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ae6e89" class="body-graf"&gt;A story like Greene's — a young, otherwise healthy person with subtle symptoms — is typical for patients who end up being diagnosed with this type of tumor, Arnaout says. Often, the first symptom is either decreased hearing, like Greene experienced, or tinnitus, a type of ringing or buzzing in the ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2e2a9f" class="body-graf"&gt;At first, people typically ignore these early mild symptoms, Arnaout says. But they don't go away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-743193" class="body-graf"&gt;After a while, "the natural thing to do is to get a hearing test," he explains, "and the test actually reveals a certain pattern of hearing loss that is associated more often than not with a tumor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8ee2d9" class="body-graf"&gt;In Greene's case, he underwent two hearing tests. The first, in the spring of 2024, showed that he did have reduced hearing in one ear, but it was still within the range of normal, he recalls. The second happened the day before his MRI, at which point his hearing loss was much more profound. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7be528" class="body-graf"&gt;"It was very frustrating because I could hear that a sound was being made, but I couldn't distinguish what word was being spoken," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-39fff8" class="body-heading"&gt;A Lengthy, Delicate Surgery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4f6ffe" class="body-graf"&gt;When these tumors are smaller, doctors might leave them alone and just monitor them, Arnaout says. "Sometimes we catch them and they're like the size of a grain of rice or a raisin," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c4b0f2" class="body-graf"&gt;But when they're more medium-sized, like Greene's 3-centimeter tumor, "they start to push up against the brainstem, and now you're having a little bit of a different conversation," says Arnaout, who was one of the surgeons who performed Greene's brain surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ffee75" class="body-graf"&gt;If left untreated, the tumor could continue to grow and cause &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/what-acoustic-neuroma-dad-35-diagnosed-brain-tumor-t216069" target="_blank"&gt;more severe — potentially life-threatening — issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-6adf3b"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="5712" data-original-width="4284"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/-Stephen-GreeneAS10142025-3-63a3c2.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/-Stephen-GreeneAS10142025-3-63a3c2.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/-Stephen-GreeneAS10142025-3-63a3c2.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/-Stephen-GreeneAS10142025-3-63a3c2.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/-Stephen-GreeneAS10142025-3-63a3c2.jpg" alt="Stephen Greene's operation required two surgical teams."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Stephen Greene's operation required two surgical teams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Stephen Greene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3581f9" class="body-graf"&gt;Greene underwent surgery, most of which was performed by a neurosurgery team (including Arnaout in his case) and handed off to an ear surgeon in the final stages. It's not uncommon for these surgeries to be quite long, Arnaout says, and Greene's was around 12 to 13 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2c8e53" class="body-graf"&gt;The brain surgery team creates the opening, takes the pressure off the brainstem, and starts the delicate work around the nerves until the team gets to the ear canal, Arnaout explains, at which point the ear surgery team takes over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f7ce1" class="body-graf"&gt;In Greene's case, the surgeons decided to leave a small bit (about 5%) of the tumor behind to reduce the risk of facial paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-d87486" class="body-heading"&gt;'You Can't Control It, But You Can Handle It'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a35e94" class="body-graf"&gt;Greene's surgery was successful and he did not have any facial paralysis. But the hearing he lost is permanently gone. He'll be meeting with a specialist in January to discuss possible implants or other devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-db8000" class="body-graf"&gt;And his recovery has been long and challenging in other ways, he says. Waking up after surgery, "there's double vision, there's certainly brain fog, not being able to remember or kind of get your thoughts across," Greene recalls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a07e87" class="body-graf"&gt;He also had to "relearn to walk a little bit."

These subtle movements may offer vital insights into aging and conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Cardiovascular Research&lt;/em&gt;, the study presents the first noninvasive approach for measuring "microvascular volumetric pulsatility" -- the rhythmic swelling and shrinking of tiny blood vessels -- in living humans. Using ultra-high field 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the researchers found that these microvessel pulses become stronger with age, particularly in the brain's deep white matter. This region is essential for communication between brain networks but is also vulnerable to reduced blood flow from distal arteries, which carry blood from the heart to the outermost parts of the body. As these pulses intensify, they may interfere with brain function and contribute to memory decline and Alzheimer's progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Arterial pulsation is like the brain's natural pump, helping to move fluids and clear waste," said Danny JJ Wang, PhD, professor of neurology and radiology at the Keck School of Medicine and senior author of the study. "Our new method allows us to see, for the first time in people, how the volumes of those tiny blood vessels change with aging and vascular risk factors. This opens new avenues for studying brain health, dementia, and small vessel disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long recognized that stiffness and excessive pulsation in large arteries are linked to stroke, dementia, and small vessel disease. However, until now, it has been nearly impossible to observe these rhythmic changes in the brain's smallest vessels without using invasive procedures limited to animal studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome this, the USC team combined two advanced MRI techniques -- vascular space occupancy (VASO) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) -- to monitor subtle shifts in microvessel volume throughout the cardiac cycle. Their results revealed that older adults exhibit stronger microvascular pulsations in deep white matter compared to younger individuals, and that hypertension further intensifies these effects. "These findings provide a missing link between what we see in large vessel imaging and the microvascular damage we observe in aging and Alzheimer's disease," said lead author Fanhua Guo, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in Wang's lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive vascular pulsation may also disrupt the brain's "glymphatic system," a recently discovered network that removes waste substances such as beta-amyloid, a protein that accumulates in Alzheimer's disease. Over time, interference with this fluid circulation could hasten cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Being able to measure these tiny vascular pulses in vivo is a critical step forward," said Arthur W. Toga, PhD, director of the Stevens INI. "This technology not only advances our understanding of brain aging but also holds promise for early diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative disorders."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers are exploring how the method could be adapted for wider clinical use, including on more commonly available 3T MRI scanners. Future studies will test whether microvascular volumetric pulsatility predicts cognitive outcomes and whether it can serve as a biomarker for early intervention in Alzheimer's disease and related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is just the beginning," Wang said. "Our goal is to bring this from research labs into clinical practice, where it could guide diagnosis, prevention, and treatment strategies for millions at risk of dementia."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This progressive loss of brain cells leads to severe symptoms including memory decline, cognitive impairment, and difficulty with movement. Over time, these conditions can greatly diminish quality of life and often leave patients dependent on continuous care. Current medications can help ease symptoms but do not stop or reverse the underlying disease, highlighting the urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. One promising strategy focuses on stimulating neuronal differentiation, the process of forming new neurons that could replace those lost and potentially slow or counteract neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K, a fat-soluble nutrient best known for its role in blood clotting and bone health, has recently attracted attention for its influence on brain cell development and protection. However, naturally occurring vitamin K forms such as menaquinone 4 (MK-4) may not be potent enough for effective use in regenerative therapies targeting neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking study published in &lt;em&gt;ACS Chemical Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, researchers from the Department of Bioscience and Engineering at Shibaura Institute of Technology in Japan, led by Associate Professor Yoshihisa Hirota and Professor Yoshitomo Suhara, created and tested new vitamin K analogues with stronger neuroactive effects. The team also identified a distinct mechanism through which vitamin K promotes neuronal differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explaining their findings, Dr. Hirota noted, "The newly synthesized vitamin K analogues demonstrated approximately threefold greater potency in inducing the differentiation of neural progenitor cells into neurons compared to natural vitamin K. Since neuronal loss is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, these analogues may serve as regenerative agents that help replenish lost neurons and restore brain function."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To boost vitamin K's biological impact, the team produced 12 hybrid vitamin K homologs by linking them with retinoic acid (an active metabolite of vitamin A that encourages neuronal differentiation), a carboxylic acid group, or a methyl ester side chain. They then evaluated how effectively each compound promoted neuronal differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K and retinoic acid influence gene transcription through the steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR) and retinoic acid receptor (RAR), respectively. The researchers measured SXR and RAR activity in mouse neural progenitor cells treated with the newly developed compounds and found that the hybrids maintained the biological functions of both parent molecules. They also measured the expression of microtubule-associated protein 2 (Map2), a neuronal growth marker, to track cell differentiation. One compound, which combined retinoic acid with a methyl ester side chain, produced a threefold increase in neuronal differentiation compared with the control and showed significantly stronger activity than natural vitamin K. This enhanced version was designated as the Novel vitamin K analog (Novel VK).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand how vitamin K protects neurons, the team compared gene expression patterns in neural stem cells treated with MK-4, which promotes neuronal differentiation, to those treated with a compound that suppresses it. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that vitamin K-induced neuronal differentiation is mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) through downstream epigenetic and transcriptional processes. The effect of MK-4 was specifically linked to mGluR1. Previous studies have shown that mGluR1 plays a key role in synaptic communication, and that mice lacking this receptor experience motor and synaptic impairments similar to those seen in neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delving deeper, the researchers conducted structural simulations and molecular docking studies to elucidate whether the vitamin K homolog interacts with mGluR1. Indeed, their analysis revealed a stronger binding affinity between Novel VK and mGluR1. Finally, the researchers examined the cellular uptake of Novel VK and its conversion to bioactive MK-4 in cells and mice. They noted a significant concentration-dependent increase in the intracellular concentration of MK-4. Moreover, Novel VK converted to MK-4 more easily than natural vitamin K. Further, &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments in mice showed that Novel VK exhibited a stable pharmacokinetic profile, crossed the blood-brain barrier, and achieved higher MK-4 concentration in the brain compared to the control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the study sheds light on the mechanism by which vitamin K and its structural analogues exert neuroprotective effects, paving the way for the development of novel therapeutic agents that can delay or reverse neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concluding with the long-term implications of their work, Dr. Hirota says, "Our research offers a potentially groundbreaking approach to treating neurodegenerative diseases. A vitamin K-derived drug that slows the progression of Alzheimer's disease or improves its symptoms could not only improve the quality of life for patients and their families but also significantly reduce the growing societal burden of healthcare expenditures and long-term caregiving."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope their research translates into clinically meaningful treatments for patients battling neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

HEPA stands for high-efficiency particulate air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"HEPA filters are designed to reduce fine and particulate matter from the air, but there is limited real world data on their effectiveness at filtering respiratory viruses transmitted via aerosols and droplets," the researchers said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Additional interventions may be needed"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that there were viruses in 98.4% of air samples from the classrooms. Each classroom had an average of three respiratory viruses present, including pathogens that cause &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-rsv-children-cases-rising/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;RSV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Air purifiers did not reduce overall viral load in classrooms, suggesting that additional interventions may be needed in schools," Mass General Dr. Peggy Lai said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kids-flu-covid-shots-fall-2025-vaccine-guidance-shifts/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;COVID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; pandemic, Boston Public Schools installed HEPA air purifiers in all of its classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Classroom humidity controls may help fight viruses&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a decrease in viral diversity with classrooms that had air purifiers, but the study found that this didn't lead to fewer school absences. One factor researchers did notice was high viral exposure in classrooms with dry air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In addition to air filtration or better ventilation, maintaining classroom humidity between 40% and 60% may help lower viral exposures and improve comfort for students and teachers," Lai said. &lt;/p&gt;

Yes, it’s a natural part of the aging process (and there are so many &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/gray-hair-styles" target="_blank"&gt;chic ways&lt;/a&gt; to let it grow out, it can even be a welcome change), but when you’re nowhere near where you thought you would be for that type of hair transformation, it can be a bit jarring. So what gives?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many factors that play into our &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/gray-hair-styles" target="_blank"&gt;hair graying&lt;/a&gt; prematurely. Family history, free radicals in the body, and oxidative stress are just some of the most common ones, says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.instagram.com/lmmedicalnyc/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/lmmedicalnyc/"}' href="https://www.instagram.com/lmmedicalnyc/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Morgan Rabach&lt;/a&gt;, MD, board-certified dermatologist at &lt;a data-offer-url="https://lmmedicalnyc.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://lmmedicalnyc.com/"}' href="https://lmmedicalnyc.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LM Medical NYC&lt;/a&gt;. One that doesn’t get talked about enough is how food—or lack of certain ones—can impact when those gray strands will appear on your head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin deficiencies can contribute to premature gray hair by interfering with melanin production and causing oxidative stress within the hair follicles,” adds Samantha Dieras, RN, DCN, director of ambulatory nutrition services at Mount Sinai Hospital. “The melanocytes (pigment-producing cells) may become damaged or dysfunctional in the absence of these nutrients, leading to loss of color.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: eating or not eating certain foods isn’t the end-all, be-all to losing your natural color. Dieras goes on to say that while studies have shown that it may be helpful to eat certain foods for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6369637/" target="_blank"&gt;repigmentation&lt;/a&gt; of their graying hair, it’s still a small part of the gray hair puzzle. With that in mind, the five best types of foods to incorporate into your diet to at least help include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Copper-Rich Foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foods to Try:&lt;/strong&gt; Liver, oysters, potatoes, and mushrooms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The element copper is key to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5855855/" target="_blank"&gt;melanin synthesis&lt;/a&gt;, says Dr. Rabach, and low levels of it may cause reduced pigmentation production in our hair. Some foods you could eat to offset a copper deficiency include potatoes, where one whole potato contains &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Copper-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;675 micrograms (mcg) of the nutrient,&lt;/a&gt; and mushrooms, which contain &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Copper-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;650 mcg&lt;/a&gt; for every half cup cooked. If you love shellfish and meat, oysters are packed with the nutrient and contain &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Copper-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;4,850 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of copper for every 3 ounces cooked, while 3 ounces of cooked beef liver contains &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Copper-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;12,400 mcg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Iron-Rich Foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foods to Try:&lt;/strong&gt; Red meat, poultry, legumes, and spinach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE9LclltYVg2dVh0Xy1EVVJhMVR3czNGZkJ3cGU2YUZkd1BIa2Q2b1hNNWFUd0h1UERkZV9YM0VNb1N6VXNfUDcyTkxaZWlIY3k3eUx0U3E2bEVWNWJsQmthZndxd0ZXOElBanc</guid></item><item><title>当海豚用突变的大脑冲上海滩时，对人类的可怕警告-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-15188909/warning-humans-dolphins-Alzheimers.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have uncovered a disturbing link between stranded dolphins and a toxin known to trigger Alzheimer's-like brain damage, which could have implications for millions of people along the US coast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers examined 20 dolphins that washed up along &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/florida/index.html" id="mol-99a06c40-a90a-11f0-9db4-65eae7fbd7ec"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;'s Indian River Lagoon and found high levels of a brain-damaging chemical produced by cyanobacteria, also called blue-green algae. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These microscopic organisms release compounds that are highly toxic to nerve cells, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15080677/tests-predict-dementia-iron-mri-john-hopkins.html"&gt;damaging the brain regions&lt;/a&gt; responsible for memory, thinking and communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dolphins stranded during peak algae blooms had up to 2,900 times more of the toxin than those found at other times of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14976983/warning-humanity-blue-whales-silent.html"&gt;Their brains also showed&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Scientists have discovered a link between stranded dolphins and a toxin known to trigger Alzheimer's-like brain damage (STOCK)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists found the hallmarks of Alzheimer's in the brains of all the dolphins tested, including misfolded tau proteins (center), amyloid plaques (left) and tangled fibers (right) that destroy neural connections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, are microscopic organisms that thrive in warm, nutrient-rich waters, especially where agricultural runoff and sewage introduce high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During 'blooms,' these organisms multiply rapidly, turning waterways bright green or blue-green and releasing toxins into the surrounding water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While these blooms may look harmless, they produce a range of toxins, including β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) and its chemical relatives 2,4-Diaminobutyric acid (2,4-DAB) and N-2-aminoethylglycine (AEG), which are highly toxic to nerve cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers noted that over time, the exposure can lead to the same type of brain changes seen in Alzheimer’s disease, including misfolded tau proteins, amyloid plaques and tangled fibers that destroy neural connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The link between these toxins and neurodegenerative disease is not just theoretical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Research involving residents of Guam has shown that people who regularly consume foods containing cyanobacterial toxins are more likely to develop the same brain abnormalities seen in Alzheimer's disease,' the team shared in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251011105521.htm"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The brains of affected individuals showed the same protein misfolding and plaque formation that occurs in Alzheimer’s patients worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experiments in laboratory animals have confirmed these findings, demonstrating that prolonged exposure to BMAA can induce cognitive decline and brain lesions virtually identical to those observed in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The team studied 20 dolphins stranded on the shores of Florida 's Indian River Lagoon, finding they all had signs of Alzheimer's &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In dolphins, the situation is particularly alarming, as top predators in marine ecosystems, dolphins are highly susceptible to bioaccumulation, the process by which toxins build up in the bodies of animals at the top of the food chain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Small fish and invertebrates ingest cyanobacterial toxins, and these compounds gradually concentrate as they move up the chain. By the time they reach dolphins, the levels can be extremely high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at the Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute in Melbourne Beach, Florida, along with collaborators at the University of Miami and the Blue World Research Institute, analyzed the brains of 20 bottlenose dolphins stranded from 2010 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found dolphins that washed ashore during periods of peak algae blooms had up to 2,900 times more 2,4-DAB in their brains than dolphins stranded at other times of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The brains displayed many hallmark signs of Alzheimer’s disease, including sticky β-amyloid plaques, hyperphosphorylated tau proteins and TDP-43 protein inclusions, a marker of more aggressive neurodegenerative forms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists also identified changes in 536 genes that correspond to patterns associated with Alzheimer’s in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The problem is worsening with climate change and increased nutrient runoff, as warmer water temperatures and prolonged sunlight create ideal conditions for cyanobacteria to bloom more often and for longer periods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Florida, water released from Lake Okeechobee into the St Lucie River and Indian River Lagoon has repeatedly carried high concentrations of cyanobacteria downstream, creating large areas of toxic water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For dolphins navigating these waters, long-term exposure is practically unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Since dolphins are considered environmental sentinels for toxic exposures in marine environments, there are concerns about human health issues associated with cyanobacterial blooms,' Davis said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 14:57:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQQTgwTkpTUDJmODMzMXFmMmphNWtGLVN6NUFQYUxtbmllTzdqa0NPMjQzNzBtN3NRdlctT05HZmZGX0dqQTVkd1V3N3haUU5rZ0JPWnZPMjV3RkRUSVlkaUoyMHVFZGRXeVFOLWVpZFNBX2hHck5YN1hOWUx0WG5VWW9BS3V6OEM5S1l1SE9tUlFIY04wbko1M1JIUDfSAaIBQVVfeXFMTldUdFFpRWZJa0NBTkg5NTYtREFKOEdkQVg0Tkc3ODFiNXBndVA4ZzRiZlBvamxvcWtTSXNEYXNPRGV4b1NtM2o1bEpSdHpxRnhjQ0JwTWtJWXd6UGhZZnZpcXYzcDNfLXJDQ1ZNNExJdjJ0Ql9nb2NwSVAxRGFManBMaGJBTW9naUlmUzh4MkdWV0xrVm00VHVDN2x2bWFFUzFn</guid></item><item><title>加重背心是怎么回事？ -第19期新闻</title><link>https://19thnews.org/2025/10/weighted-vests-menopause-newsletter/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenberg article-body-width js-hang-punc"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone on Instagram — and walking down the sidewalk or around the playground — seems to be wearing a weighted vest. Everyone but me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forbes &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2025/08/19/weighted-vests-are-now-a-fitness-trend-heres-what-you-need-to-know/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the weighted vest market generated $205 million in 2024, and that number is expected to be even higher for 2025. So it’s not all in my head: They’re big business, and American women are happily buying in. A political pollster recently found that &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/19/weighted-vest-women-are-the-2026-swing-voters-00572657"&gt;1 in 6 American women&lt;/a&gt; has one. &lt;/p&gt;


  

  
      
  





&lt;p&gt;That has made me feel a little left out and paranoid. Was I doing a major disservice to my health by not strapping [checks notes] three to 30 pounds to my back to walk around my neighborhood? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cue the expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So I reached out to &lt;a href="https://www.scranton.edu/directory/profiles/health-and-human-performance/joan-grossman.shtml"&gt;Joan Grossman&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, a registered dietitian/nutritionist who is also an associate professor of health and human performance at the University of Scranton. Her research focuses on how various forms of exercise impact post-menopausal body composition and performance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Grossman said that when it comes to health and longevity, the most important thing is daily body resistance training, or strength training. Such training — using resistance to build muscle strength — is critical for bone health, heart health and metabolic health; research has found that women who engage in regular strength training live longer. It helps preserve the lean muscle mass that’s important for health but decreases with age. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But don’t get daunted: What Grossman has replicated in her research multiple times over is that 15 minutes a day of strength training is all it takes to elicit real body composition change. This most likely will look like basic exercises that you’re already familiar with: squats, lunges, push-ups and bicep curls are all forms of strength training.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enter the current chatter about weighted vests, often touted as a way for women to get that strength training they need to protect their bone health and build lean muscle mass. But there’s actually really limited research on weighted vests themselves, especially on whether they provide strength training benefits the same way that lifting weights or engaging in even body weight exercises does. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s known so far is that there seem to be &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39525516/"&gt;cardiovascular benefits&lt;/a&gt; from walking with a weighted vest. But a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22338922/"&gt;small study&lt;/a&gt; done by Thai researchers found no difference in bone health between those who walked with weighted vests and those who walked without. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s probably because the best exercises for bone density and lean muscle mass are those that involve executing a full range of body motion while utilizing significant resistance. (Think: a series of lunges while holding hand weights.)&lt;/p&gt;


  







&lt;p&gt;“You have to tug on those muscles in order for the muscles to require that metabolic demand,” Grossman said. “And when I say tug on them, I mean you have to use them. It takes work.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the trick is to &lt;em&gt;keep &lt;/em&gt;using them in this way, even as you continue to age. (Yes, Grossman said — you can definitely be 75 and doing a full body squat. And the best way to ensure that’s possible then? Start practicing now.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, could a weighted vest help with this? Maybe, but the research is far from definitive. And should you buy a weighted vest? Sure, if you want to. But do you need to? Not necessarily. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Grossman also advises some caution: There’s also a risk of injury with weighted vests — whether from strain or loss of balance — especially if people are wearing them while doing other forms of resistance training at a gym with little experience. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So why &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;weighted vests everywhere? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I wanted to unpack what to make of their overwhelming popularity. I called &lt;a href="https://www.newschool.edu/lang/faculty/natalia-mehlman-petrzela/"&gt;Natalia Mehlman Petrzela&lt;/a&gt;, a historian, associate professor at The New School and the author of “&lt;a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo184287097.html"&gt;Fit Nation: The Gains and Pains of America’s Exercise Obsession&lt;/a&gt;.” She’s a woman in her 40s and so she also sees weighted vests all around her. And when she sees them, she thinks about the ThighMaster. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fitness in the United States “is primarily a marketplace, and there is always a new product being marketed,” she said. Weighted vests are just the latest magic cure for all that ails you as you age — weight gain! loss of bone density! loss of muscle tone! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What feels new, though, is that the product also promises to maximize your productivity. “The fact that a weighted vest is a device that you can just put on when you’re just walking around suggests that just walking around isn’t good enough, that you actually should be optimizing that time on your feet to &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;be working out at the same time,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;

                        More From Jennifer Gerson:
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;figure class=""&gt;
                            
                            &lt;/figure&gt;
                                                            &lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li class="ups-block__single-article__item wp-block-single-article-grid__item"&gt;
                
            &lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The immense popularity of weighted vests is also a sign of a change in how society sees middle-aged women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s this thorny thing happening where there is this shift from seeing women past a certain age as invisible and unattractive and unworthy of any sort of attention to now seeing them as women who can be sexually attractive and have desires and deserve to feel good,” Mehlman Petrzela said. “I think the double-edged sword of that is that there’s this constant pressure to work on yourself and that now, when you’re 55, you actually still have a lot of pressure to look hot and work out all the time and feel great and be working on yourself and not let yourself go — that pressure didn’t exist in, say, 1960 or even 1990.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a whole other weight to carry. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mehlman Petrzela said that when she sees women walking in her neighborhood wearing weighted vests, she commends them on their commitment to caring for themselves and prioritizing health. But also:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It feels a little bit like this Army of Women who are never allowed to stop working on their fitness, even when they’re going about their day. The idea or the reality that we women who are already carrying so much are now carrying an extra burden to do all of that can sometimes feel, well, a little much.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking of a little much&lt;/strong&gt; … &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a few weeks, we’re going to be talking about something I have been hearing a lot about from my peers IRL: the dynamic of a mother going through perimenopause living in the same household as a daughter going through puberty and what so many hormones under one roof can look and feel like. (I have a middle schooler myself so … yes.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Is this also you? &lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a0c3cfcdcdd5cec9d4d9e09199d4c8cec5d7d38ecfd2c7"&gt;Please write to me&lt;/a&gt;! I would love to speak with you for this upcoming edition about what you’re experiencing — and what you’re learning about yourself and your child in real time as you change, together. &lt;/p&gt;

So I started to look for a solution to fix that,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael’s girlfriend, Lana, has enjoyed participating in his experiments. “ It’s just very interesting,” she says. “He revealed to me that he was taking his concoction. We experimented with different dosages of everything and saw what that did, so that was kind of cool.” Michael and Lana asked to use pseudonyms to protect their privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lana is not alone among women in preferring more semen. Both Steven and Mike began supplementing after their girlfriends reacted negatively to the small size of their loads. “There are plenty of women who like cum and like to have it on their bodies,” says &lt;em&gt;Good Sex&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74LGNawQJq0&amp;amp;"&gt;Neal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My guess is that the majority of women probably don’t mind having a little bit more ejaculate from their partner,” Neal says. “And I would guess that there’s a not insubstantial subsection of women who actually really would love to have more ejaculate from their partner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many men find that their partners do not appreciate their newfound talent.

So, this is, I think, a little more selfish.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But achieving more semen volume is more attainable than those other goals. “ It’s so much easier and there’s so much less risk, and quite honestly, it’s a lot cheaper,” Hink says. Ultimately, the desire for a larger load is the desire to satisfy oneself. “It’s the pièce de résistance,” Steven says. “It’s the reward for the job well done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxQcUNsdHhXMnVHQnhadEo0Nl9BUkx0Y0FaQTRJMU1KSEczMnQ2eFltT0kyUkgwdW9pS29zREpiamVzb2xJbXZxcUFyV01CbXl2OVYwNkl4MWRIOXJ5eHFYZkdXRkp4UnlhUWNLTElnaXNnQndYVE96YUNFbHJKdU5kVWlXUHQyajA</guid></item><item><title>日本宣布流感疫情—这对其他国家意味着什么-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03367-z</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03367-z/d41586-025-03367-z_51572084.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03367-z/d41586-025-03367-z_51572084.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="A crowd of mask wearing commuters on a busy street in Osaka City." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03367-z/d41586-025-03367-z_51572084.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Cases of influenza are surging in Japan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Kota Kawasaki/Yomiuri Shimbun via AP/Alamy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan’s health authorities have declared an influenza epidemic, with thousands of people infected with the respiratory virus. The number of infections is unusual for this time of year, researchers say, and could seed outbreaks in countries that are heading into winter in Asia and Europe — although it is unlikely to become a global pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 10 October, 6,013 cases of influenza virus have been reported in Japan. More than 100 schools have closed, and nearly half of the 287 people who were hospitalized for flu in September were children aged 14 or younger. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare declared a nationwide epidemic on 3 October. Outbreaks are classified as epidemics when the number of infections is higher than expected in a given area over a particular period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks of influenza virus tend to occur &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03666-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03666-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;seasonally each year&lt;/a&gt;, predominantly in winter across countries with temperate climates. In Japan, that usually occurs around the end of November. This year, the increase in people being treated for flu started five weeks earlier than usual, says Vinod Balasubramaniam, a molecular virologist at Monash University Malaysia in Subang Jaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan has had early starts to the flu season in the past few years, but not this early, says Ian Barr, a researcher and deputy director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, who is based in Melbourne, Australia. “You might see cases in October, but not epidemic-type numbers,” says Barr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03519-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03519-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Increasing international travel&lt;/a&gt; since the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01315-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01315-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; is one factor that could be behind the early start to the flu season, says Balasubramaniam. Other factors include climate change and a lack of exposure to the circulating virus, particularly for elderly people and young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information about which strains are circulating in Japan has not yet emerged, but Barr says the outbreaks there could be caused by a strain of influenza A, called H3N2, that surged in Australia and New Zealand over the past two months, coinciding with the end of winter in the Southern Hemisphere. People from Australia are travelling to Japan in huge numbers, he says, meaning there are more chances for virus transmission between hemispheres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

That mix of frustration, disbelief, and just a little bit of amusement? That’s exactly what unfolded in a viral video when one clever rescue Golden Retriever pushed her mom’s patience and ended up leaving thousands of viewers in stitches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Watch rescue Golden Retriever wear mom’s stockings after stealing them in hilarious video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meet Mango, a rescue &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; who is no stranger to mischief. In a recent viral clip, Mango’s mom shared what happened when her curious pup decided to help herself to a pair of black stockings. Rather than scolding her, Mango’s owner decided to enforce a lighthearted house rule: “You steal it, you wear it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The video opens with Mango proudly holding her mom’s stockings between her paws, looking both guilty and defiant. The on-screen text humorously reads, “Another episode of ‘You steal it, you wear it.’” Moments later, the camera cuts to Mango, who now wears the stockings on her hind legs like a runway model. The sight is both ridiculous and adorable as the fluffy Golden stands confidently, clearly unbothered by her new “outfit.” Her mom jokingly captioned the video, “Girl where did you even find these?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The combination of Mango’s calm demeanor and her unusual outfit had viewers howling with laughter. One user joked, “Wowww we were not prepared for that,” while another encouraged, “Now STRUT your stuff Mango!” Someone else chimed in, “I’m going to go snag something cute right now!!!!” as if inspired to join the trend. Another viewer added, “This needs to come with an NSFW warning,” referencing Mango’s “spicy” runway look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many praised her mom’s lighthearted way of handling a classic case of canine mischief.

Only some groups of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a34304173/mount-vesuvius-victim-brain-cells-preserved/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain cells;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brain cells&lt;/a&gt; that are activated during bouts of pain had been identified in the central and peripheral nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, after a series of experiments on mice, biologist Nicholas Betley from the University of Pennsylvania has discovered that a previously overlooked group of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/a24760/bat-neurons-discovered/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neurons;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt; in the parabrachial nucleus is switched on in individuals with chronic pain. He and his research team also found that there is a molecule that the brain can release for pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We focused on the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN), a major entry point of sensory information from the periphery and the first site of integration of many affective behavioral states,” Betley said in a study recently published in the journal &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09602-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Fhealth%2Fa69014450%2Fscientists-found-the-potential-off-button-for-stopping-chronic-pain%2F" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Populations of neurons in the lPBN […] respond to acute [pain-related] stimuli, and prolonged activation of excitatory lPBN neurons can drive a chronic pain-like state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9119955/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:parabrachial nucleus;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;parabrachial nucleus&lt;/a&gt; is made up of different neuron clusters in the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560589/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dorsolateral pons;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dorsolateral pons&lt;/a&gt; of the brainstem. Known as Y1R neurons, they transmit sensory information (such as taste and &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a23834/record-hot-years-could-be-new-normal-by-2025/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:temperature;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;temperature&lt;/a&gt;) in addition to pain, also regulating appetite and threat signals. While Y1R neurons exist in various subpopulations, what they have in common is the expression of receptors for &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00869/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neuropeptide Y or NPY;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;neuropeptide Y or NPY&lt;/a&gt;, which regulates types of brain activity like metabolism, heart rate, immune function, blood pressure, and even stress reduction. Other studies that involved monitoring neural activity and running computer models showed a link to chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Betley and his research team used painful stimuli (such as exposure to a hot surface) to activate Y1R neurons in mice, and as they predicted, the mice showed behaviors associated with persistent &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a33433129/neanderthal-low-pain-tolerance/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pain;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt;, such as paw licking. When the Y1R neurons were blocked, pain became much less persistent, and the mice only had short pain responses after being exposed to the same stimuli. There was one group of Y1R neurons that stayed active during licking, which suggests that a subpopulation of Y1R neurons is responsible for part of the Y1R response during extended periods of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Y1R neurons do not directly cause pain, they are thought to be involved in a larger network that is behind painful sensations. The way these neurons are organized allows them to receive sensory inputs, including pain signals sent from the spinal cord, which the neurons then send to multiple regions of the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a69001666/ultrasound-helmet-parkinsons-breakthrough/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something else the researchers wanted to see was whether pain took precedence over survival. They temporarily deprived the mice of food and water and also introduced a frightening stimulus (like the scent of a &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a67955893/early-humans-eaten-by-leopards/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:predator;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;predator&lt;/a&gt;), and when faced with these perceived threats to their survival, the mice experienced significantly less pain. It turned out that production of neuropeptide Y increased in the parabrachial nucleus when the animals were faced with something that could literally mean life or death. Betley’s findings could mean that someday, a drug that signals neurons to produce more NPY could be a viable and safe alternative to painkillers such as opioids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This mechanism is an efficient and tunable system that enables urgent needs to shift brain state away from pain and towards other states that promote &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/a29653543/math-zombie-apocalypse/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:survival;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;survival&lt;/a&gt;,” he &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09602-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Fhealth%2Fa69014450%2Fscientists-found-the-potential-off-button-for-stopping-chronic-pain%2F" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;cpos:15;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. “Future work could build from these findings to test other endogenous or pharmacological interventions that curb pain state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 13:12:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPc2tlQ0hZTHRDMVJLZmtEb2dpRnAyNFlRSUxoSnVWZk1xeTQ4WDJoS1VJT1Vad2dSQU5MdnNUTWRsTllFUkZ2MzBPTVdPcFVKM2t5YzI4NXBkMldBYy1rWGNqTS1TTXNWZ2s2anMyOUpvMzFheDNrRExFRGlNMklRXzVCQTJSTnFq</guid></item><item><title>简单的脂肪酸可以恢复失败的视力- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251014014307.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;Changes in eyesight are one of the most familiar effects of getting older. Sit in a dim restaurant with someone over 60, and you might hear, "Hold on -- let me pull out my cell phone. I need more light to read the menu!" But what if declining vision with age could actually be reversed?&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at UC Irvine have taken a closer look at that question, investigating a potential treatment aimed at slowing or even undoing "aging" in the eye while also preventing age-related diseases such as macular degeneration (AMD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We show the potential for reversing age-related vision loss," explains Dorota Skowronska-Krawczyk, PhD, an associate professor in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics and the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences. The study, conducted in partnership with scientists from the Polish Academy of Sciences and the Health and Medical University in Potsdam, Germany, presents findings published in &lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt; under the title "Retinal polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation reverses aging-related vision decline in mice."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding the "Aging" Gene&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research builds on earlier work involving the Elongation of Very Long Chain Fatty Acids Protein 2 (ELOVL2), a well-established biomarker of aging. "We showed that we have lower vision when this ELOVL2 enzyme isn't active," says Skowronska-Krawczyk, who is also part of the Robert M. Brunson Center for Translational Vision Research at the UC Irvine School of Medicine. In that previous study, boosting ELOVL2 activity in aging mice increased levels of the omega−3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the eye and led to better vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new research aimed to find a way to achieve similar benefits without depending on the ELOVL2 enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people age, changes in lipid metabolism reduce the amount of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFAs) in the retina. This decline can impair vision and contribute to AMD. The ELOVL2 gene plays a crucial role in producing both VLC-PUFAs and DHA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When researchers injected older mice with a specific polyunsaturated fatty acid, their visual performance improved. "It's a proof-of-concept for turning lipid injection into a possible therapy," says Skowronska-Krawczyk. "What is important is that we didn't see the same effect with DHA." Others have also questioned the ability of DHA to slow AMD progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our work really confirms the fact that DHA alone cannot do the work, but we have this other fatty acid that is seemingly working and improving vision in aged animals," says Skowronska-Krawczyk. "We have also shown on a molecular level that it actually reverses the aging features."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the researchers found genetic variants in the ELOVL2 enzyme that correlate with faster progression of AMD. "Now we actually have a genetic connection to the disease and its aging aspect," says Skowronska-Krawczyk, "so we could potentially identify people at higher risk for vision loss progression." This could lead to not only therapeutic treatment options but also targeted interventions for prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings have only further solidified Skowronska-Krawczyk's view of the importance of the ELOVL2 enzyme. "I am pretty convinced it's one of the top aging genes that we should look at when we think about anti-aging therapies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking Beyond the Retina&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a collaboration with researchers from UC San Diego, Skowronska-Krawczyk has also started to explore the role of lipid metabolism in immune system aging. That study found that the lack of ELOVL2 enzyme induces accelerated aging of immune cells, suggesting that systemic lipid supplementation could potentially counteract the effects of age on the immune system. It also suggested that lipid metabolism might play a role in blood cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our first study explored a potential therapy to address vision loss," says Skowronska-Krawczyk, "but with the information we've since learned about immune aging, we are hopeful the supplementation therapy will boost the immune system as well."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
