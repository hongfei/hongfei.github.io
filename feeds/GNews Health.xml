&lt;p&gt;So residents of Wales born on either side of the dividing date were matched according to their use of preventative health services, past diagnoses, and educational level. The incidence of dementia was then compared between people on either side of September 2, 1933. As a first step, the researchers confirmed that the vaccine was effective at reducing the incidence of shingles, with numbers similar to those in the vaccine's clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, being eligible for the vaccine was associated with a 1.3 percent reduction in the absolute risk of a dementia diagnosis. That translates to a 8.5 percent reduction of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"&gt;relative risk&lt;/a&gt;; when scaled to account for the fact that fewer than half of those eligible received the vaccine, that works out to be a 20 percent reduction in relative risk, which is pretty substantial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure that it was real, the researchers repeated the analysis using a difference-in-difference approach and came up with roughly the same numbers. That also eliminates the possibility that people who came in for health care (for shingles or some other condition) were more likely to incidentally receive a dementia diagnosis. They also compared the before-and-after populations in terms of a collection of common health outcomes and found that none of those showed any change in the two populations. And nothing else related to NHS policy was changed based on the September 2 date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, in &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.08.23295225v1"&gt;a draft manuscript&lt;/a&gt; the researchers posted on the Med arXiv, the researchers find a similar effect when using UK HNS data to search for a protective effect of the shingles vaccines when it comes to deaths diagnosed to result from dementia. So by all indications, the effect was real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s going on?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest three potential explanations. One of them is the obvious: Suppressing the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus reduces dementia onset. But it's also possible that the effect is indirect—that dementia is associated with immune activity, and the vaccine alters that in some way. Finally, there's the possibility that being treated for shingles could promote the onset of dementia or increase the frequency of diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

before, odds are you've tried just about everything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of the day, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14140345/guide-weight-loss-jabs-experts-latest-science-health-revolution.html"&gt;most weight loss experts&lt;/a&gt; agree that as long as you're in a 'calorie deficit' - eating less calories than is required for your body to maintain its current weight - you should see results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while this seems simple in theory, it's not always as simple in execution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, researchers are finding that intermittent fasting - one of the many weight loss 'hacks' you've probably tried - might be more efficient than simply cutting calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Intermittent fasting usually means cycling between periods of eating and not eating (fasting),' director of clinical education at Seca and registered dietician/nutritionist &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://thepcc.org/profiles/nina-crowley/"&gt;Nina Crowley&lt;/a&gt; told DailyMail.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained that the most common formats for intermittent fasting include 16:8 (where you fast for 16 hours and eat during an eight-hour window) or 5:2.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These patterns are designed to help people reduce overall energy intake without tracking every calorie,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-01631"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, used a version called 4:3 intermittent fasting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dietician and nutritionist Nina Crowley said intermittent fasting may work for some because it feels less overwhelming than daily calorie restriction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crowley explained that in this case, participants followed a 80 percent calories restriction on three (non-consecutive) days a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And on the other four days, they ate without calorie targets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The control group had a daily calorie restriction - and both groups were match for overall weekly calorie deficit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But their approaches were different, proving intermittent fasting to be more effective.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This approach may feel less overwhelming for some people compared to daily calorie restriction, as it allows for more flexibility and less constant focus on food,' Crowley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The intermittent fasting group lost 7.6 percent of their body fat over 52 weeks while the calorie deficit group lost five percent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crowley suggested one explanation could be that the intermittent fasting group didn't have to restrict their eating every day - reducing decision fatigue and improving adherence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The [intermittent fasting] group also had lower dropout rates (19 percent vs. 27 percent), suggesting it may have been more sustainable for some,' Crowley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While typical intermittent fasting follows a 16:8 method, this study used a 4:3 structure (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'From a behavior change lens, people may find intermittent fasting easier to integrate because it defines boundaries (fast vs. eat) rather than asking for constant moderation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And from a metabolic standpoint, alternating fasting and feeding days may influence hormonal responses related to hunger and fat oxidation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Crowley said that weight-loss methods should be evaluated in a more complex way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained that in this particular study, fat mass and fat-free mass were not directly assessed, which can vary whether or not people would want to use a specific method like intermittent fasting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We know from other research that prolonged or aggressive energy restriction - even in structured plans - may result in unwanted loss from muscle, especially without adequate protein intake or resistance training,' Crowley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said a way to combat this in future studies is to couple any dietary strategy with body composition monitoring.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When we assess fat mass, muscle mass, and hydration status, we get a much more complete picture of someone's health progress,' Crowley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sustainable weight loss should protect muscle and support energy and function - not just reduce the number on the scale.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Crowley said this study didn't take body composition or muscle mass into account (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she agreed that intermittent fasting can be helpful for some people, she also pointed out that it's important to consider how realistically it may fit into daily life,  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Meals often serve social and emotional purposes beyond nutrition, and fasting windows may not always align with family routines, social events, or workout schedules,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crowley also explained that those who are physically active may also rely on the timing of their meals for performance and recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this is why it's important for each individual to find something that works for them and their own, unique long-term health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When a plan feels flexible, realistic, and aligned with someone's lifestyle, it's more likely to lead to sustainable progress - not just in weight, but in overall health and quality of life,' Crowley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;mol-permabox id="mol-66556140-0fc9-11f0-82c0-c75d4ffa30e6"&gt;&lt;div class=" mol-factbox art-ins femail" data-version="2" id="mol-306aa300-4f00-11e9-8cac-6f0dfc36d1de" data-permabox-url="/health/fb-6847595/WHAT-INTERMITTENT-FASTING-16-8-DIET.html"&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Intermittent fasting involves switching between days of fasting and days of eating normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Intermittent fasting diets fall generally into two categories - time-restricted feeding, which narrows eating times to 6-8 hours per day, also known as the 16:8 diet, and 5:2 intermittent fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 16:8 diet is a form of intermittent fasting, also known as Time Restricted Eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Followers of the eating plan fast for 16 hours a day, and eat whatever they want in the remaining eight hours - typically between 10am and 6pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This may be more tolerable than the well-known 5:2 diet - where followers restrict their calories to 500–to-600 a day for two days a week and then eat as normal for the remaining five days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to weight loss, 16:8 intermittent fasting is believed to improve blood sugar control, boost brain function and help us live longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many prefer to eat between noon and 8pm as this means they only need to fast overnight and skip breakfast, but can still eat lunch and dinner, along with a few snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When you do eat, it is best to opt for healthy options like fruits, vegetables and whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And drink water and unsweetened beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drawbacks of the fasting plan may be that people overindulge in the hours they can eat, leading to weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also result in digestive problems over the long-term, as well as hunger, fatigue and weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malaria continues to kill over &lt;strong&gt;600,000 people&lt;/strong&gt; each year, despite decades of global intervention. But a surprising new strategy could soon shift the balance: a &lt;strong&gt;repurposed drug&lt;/strong&gt; that makes &lt;strong&gt;human blood&lt;/strong&gt; lethal to the very &lt;strong&gt;mosquitoes&lt;/strong&gt; that spread the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Scientists have discovered that &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt;, a medication developed decades ago, can kill mosquitoes within hours after they feed on blood containing even small doses of the drug. The approach doesn’t protect individuals directly from infection, but it could reduce &lt;strong&gt;mosquito populations&lt;/strong&gt; enough to slow or halt the spread of &lt;strong&gt;malaria&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Turning Blood Into a Mosquito Killer&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adr4827" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, highlight how a low dose of &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt; can render blood lethal to mosquitoes. After feeding on treated blood, the insects died within hours. Remarkably, the drug remained active for up to &lt;strong&gt;16 days&lt;/strong&gt; in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This indirect method of control focuses on stopping the parasite’s transmission cycle by targeting mosquitoes before they can lay eggs. Scientists compare it to the principle behind &lt;strong&gt;herd immunity&lt;/strong&gt;, where protection arises not from individual immunity, but from coordinated, community-wide intervention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers caution that the drug is not intended as a stand-alone solution, but as part of an integrated approach that could include &lt;strong&gt;bed nets&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;insecticides&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;malaria vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;, and other control strategies. This method could be especially valuable in areas where mosquitoes have already developed &lt;strong&gt;insecticide resistance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;From Herbicide to Human Medicine to Mosquito Control&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The history of &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt; is unusual. It was originally developed as an &lt;strong&gt;herbicide&lt;/strong&gt; based on a natural toxin from the &lt;strong&gt;Australian bottlebrush plant&lt;/strong&gt;. Its mechanism involved disrupting &lt;strong&gt;tyrosine&lt;/strong&gt;, an amino acid crucial to plant metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Later, researchers discovered that &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt; could help treat &lt;strong&gt;metabolic disorders&lt;/strong&gt; in humans, including &lt;strong&gt;tyrosinemia type I&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;alkaptonuria&lt;/strong&gt;—conditions where the body can’t properly break down tyrosine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Approved by the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration&lt;/strong&gt; in 1992, the drug became a lifesaving treatment for children with these rare diseases. “This is the only thing that has kept children with tyrosinemia type I alive,” said &lt;a href="https://biology.nd.edu/people/alvaro-acosta-serrano/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Álvaro Acosta Serrano&lt;/a&gt;, a coauthor of the new study and a &lt;strong&gt;parasitologist&lt;/strong&gt; at the &lt;strong&gt;University of Notre Dame&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While side effects exist in patients who need high doses of &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt;, researchers emphasize that the amount required to affect mosquitoes is significantly lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Biological Weakness Exploited&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery that nitisinone could target &lt;strong&gt;blood-feeding insects&lt;/strong&gt; goes back to 2016, when Brazilian researchers &lt;strong&gt;Marcos Sterkel&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Pedro Oliveira&lt;/strong&gt; found that mosquitoes, flies, and fleas rely on &lt;strong&gt;tyrosine metabolism&lt;/strong&gt; to process blood meals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The insects are flooded with tyrosine after feeding, and if that processing system is disrupted, they die. The researchers approached Acosta Serrano’s lab, which had studied &lt;strong&gt;tsetse flies&lt;/strong&gt;, another blood-sucking parasite, to test the drug’s effect. The team later expanded the work to focus on mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt; already has &lt;strong&gt;FDA approval&lt;/strong&gt;, it may face fewer regulatory barriers in its new application. It’s been approved for &lt;strong&gt;newborns&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;children&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;pregnant individuals&lt;/strong&gt; and has not been linked to adverse effects, making it an attractive candidate for broader use in &lt;strong&gt;public health&lt;/strong&gt; campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Promising but Complex Solution&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts in the field view the findings as exciting but recognize challenges. &lt;strong&gt;George Dimopoulos&lt;/strong&gt;, a molecular biologist at the &lt;strong&gt;Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health&lt;/strong&gt;, called the study “very interesting” and noted that side effects from &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt; appear less severe than those from &lt;strong&gt;ivermectin&lt;/strong&gt;, another drug previously studied for reducing &lt;strong&gt;malaria transmission&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One hurdle is &lt;strong&gt;cost&lt;/strong&gt;. Because nitisinone is currently used to treat rare conditions, it remains &lt;strong&gt;expensive&lt;/strong&gt;. Acosta Serrano believes that with more interest, production costs could be lowered by as much as &lt;strong&gt;80 percent&lt;/strong&gt;. But price isn’t the only concern. Since the drug doesn’t directly protect the individual taking it, there could be resistance to its widespread adoption. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s always tricky to convince people to take a drug that doesn’t protect them,” Dimopoulos said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers are exploring whether the drug could be delivered in different ways. Treating &lt;strong&gt;livestock&lt;/strong&gt;, which attract mosquitoes, could be one solution. Another involves &lt;strong&gt;insecticide-laced nectar bags&lt;/strong&gt; designed to draw mosquitoes while avoiding harm to other pollinators. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In theory, nitisinone could be administered via this method as well. Dimopoulos notes, “You would not necessarily have to administer it to humans.” As with any &lt;strong&gt;mosquito control&lt;/strong&gt; strategy, the possibility of &lt;strong&gt;resistance&lt;/strong&gt; developing remains. Still, both Acosta Serrano and Dimopoulos agree that &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt; could be a valuable addition to a diversified and &lt;strong&gt;population-specific&lt;/strong&gt; approach to malaria control. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In some places, drugs combined with the vaccines could work better,” Dimopoulos explained. “In other places, &lt;strong&gt;insecticide spraying&lt;/strong&gt; and new technologies, like &lt;strong&gt;genetically engineered mosquitoes&lt;/strong&gt;, for example, could have greater efficacy.” He added, “There is no silver bullet for malaria. And I don’t think there will ever be a silver bullet.”&lt;/p&gt;

Two years later, a neurologist confirmed that Krehbiel had Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EWTYO5WRTVGCRGTPLJCQPM3UOU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He was prescribed medications to help control motor symptoms since no cure exists for Parkinson’s disease. They, however, came with disabling &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00023210-200721080-00005" target="_blank"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; such as nausea, low blood pressure, compulsive behavior and gastrointestinal issues.

The tremor’s gone, dyskinesia is gone, and I don’t have that brain fog that I used to have when I was taking so many meds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KQ7K6QKWH5CLHPFB77BJCV7WLA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As scientists continue to improve adaptive deep brain stimulation, they hope it will help other Parkinson’s patients, though they acknowledge that it may not help every patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-heMhiJ-isCenteredLayout-true" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="KN5CGBO7YJDJFEF4ES57A7PIIE" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="KN5CGBO7YJDJFEF4ES57A7PIIE"&gt;Adaptive deep brain stimulation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y2C5PWAK5RF6JAFFDTRYCK76AA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.parkinson.org/living-with-parkinsons/treatment/surgical-treatment-options/deep-brain-stimulation" target="_blank"&gt;Deep brain stimulation&lt;/a&gt;, or DBS — an established surgical therapy used since 1997 to treat Parkinson’s symptoms — implants a device similar to a heart pacemaker in the brain to deliver electrical pulses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P5O7OLQOKNBJDIRNFBDCE4EV7A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While conventional DBS is a one-size-fits-all approach, adaptive DBS personalizes therapy based on a patient’s brain activity in real time with the help of AI. In February, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://news.medtronic.com/2025-02-24-Medtronic-earns-U-S-FDA-approval-for-the-worlds-first-Adaptive-deep-brain-stimulation-system-for-people-with-Parkinsons" target="_blank"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; the first adaptive DBS system for people with Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PNUX6HZRGJEDHBTT4BQHSCKH5I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“For some patients, especially people who have more severe symptoms, standard DBS that is always on at one constant setting doesn’t give them enough benefit,” said &lt;a href="https://starrlab.ucsf.edu/people/philip-starr" target="_blank"&gt;Philip Starr,&lt;/a&gt; a professor of neurological surgery at the University of California at San Francisco. “The needs of the brain change depending on their activity level, such as when they’re awake versus asleep, and particularly according to their medication cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WM2JDUTWU5HSRB7C4F3ZK74NYQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Like the heart, the brain has normal rhythms or patterns of electrical activity produced by neurons. Medical conditions such as epilepsy and schizophrenia are associated with abnormal brain rhythms, similar to cardiac arrhythmias. In Parkinson’s disease, neurons become overly synchronized in what is known as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B978012819410200014X" target="_blank"&gt;oscillopathy&lt;/a&gt;, which may interfere with the normal transfer of information and lead to symptoms such as tremors and stiffness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ARWUQAXMBBGLNKZ77RJCQK7DCA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Imagine you’re in a crowd, and there’s a hum of conversation, but you can easily hear yourself talk — that’s the normal broadband neural activity situation,” said &lt;a href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/doctors/b/helen-brontestewart.html" target="_blank"&gt;Helen Bronte-Stewart&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of neurology and neurological sciences at Stanford School of Medicine. “But with oscillopathy, it’s as if you’re in a protest march where everybody’s chanting the same thing, and you can’t hear yourself speak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-heMhiJ-isCenteredLayout-true" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="ZDQGCYID6JCNTMOCPXWIV2Z4MY" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="ZDQGCYID6JCNTMOCPXWIV2Z4MY"&gt;Adaptive DBS adjusts stimulation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FXSLCURLA5DJNFYYYN52OBSM4E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Both DBS and Parkinson’s medications have been shown to dampen oscillopathy in the brain. In particular, the steady electrical pulses from DBS help pace the neuronal firing in a way that overrides the hyper-synchronization of oscillopathy, returning the brain rhythms back to normal, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KGKOSIN4NZG4JGA4EYNAVCRWSA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However, conventional DBS delivers electrical stimulation at a constant, “always on” setting, which can lead to periods of under-stimulation and overstimulation that result in slowness of movement or dyskinesias, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZHWHQ6PVTVGAZAHO7XGZ4YLJMM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Adaptive DBS, on the other hand, detects real-time neural signals and automatically adjusts stimulation in response to oscillopathy or other biomarkers. AI modeling is used to develop an algorithm that delivers the right amplitude or “dose” of stimulation when it is needed, in an adaptive manner, to provide a more stable therapeutic experience for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VIZJNOOP6FAZNDRENW5BZA22AU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000203099" target="_blank"&gt;Early studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that adaptive DBS is associated with greater motor symptom control, fewer side effects and lower electrical energy delivered compared with conventional DBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AXLBMBQCDJD5JLZDDKBP76LPUQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For example, in 2024, Starr and his colleagues conducted a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03196-z" target="_blank"&gt;pilot study&lt;/a&gt; of four participants with Parkinson’s, including McElroy, and found that adaptive DBS improved motor symptoms and quality of life compared with conventional DBS. They personalized algorithms for each patient by bringing them into the clinic and measuring their brain rhythms while on or off levodopa, a Parkinson’s medication used to increase levels of dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TSXK4RPFZFEOFA7OX2CJDHPNMA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“One way to develop this kind of algorithm is to first do some studies of brain signals in known conditions,” Starr said. “Then you can train an artificial intelligence algorithm on this known data, so that the AI program learns what combination of brain signals are associated with different states.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FGF2MYVHZRA2DHE5FDRPYME7UI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Starr receives support for fellowship education from Medtronic, which makes an adaptive DBS device, and Boston Scientific, which makes medical products.

By contrast, the African-style diet involved maize, okra, plantain, kidney beans and avocados&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over a follow-up of two weeks, researchers tracked participants' blood proteins related to inflammation and metabolism, and did so again four weeks later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found those who switched to a western diet had increased levels inflammatory proteins in their blood and their immune cells responded less effectively to pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03602-0"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers said the Western-style diet showed 'systemic inflammation and metabolic dysregulation'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has long linked higher levels of inflammation with an increased risk of diseases including cardiovascular disease, type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-7f85ae80-1079-11f0-8c28-6561da372c92"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and even some cancers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those who switched to a traditional African diet or consumed the fermented drink, meanwhile, showed a 'significant reduction' in inflammatory markers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some of these effects persisted even four weeks later, indicating that short-term dietary changes can have long-lasting effects, the researchers said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Quirijn de Mast added: 'We show how harmful an unhealthy Western diet can be. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'It typically consists of processed and high-calorie foods, such as French fries and white bread, with excessive salt, refined sugars, and saturated fats. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Nova system, developed by scientists in Brazil more than a decade ago, splits food into four groups based on the amount of processing it has gone through. Unprocessed foods include fruit, vegetables, nuts, eggs and meat. Processed culinary ingredients — which are usually not eaten alone — include oils, butter, sugar and salt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Inflammation is at the root of many chronic conditions, which makes this study highly relevant for western countries as well.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additive-laden foods have long been vilified over their supposed risks, with studies linking them to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-25dbcca0-8fad-11ee-98d2-2552a4bb0130"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have even called for all ultra-processed foods (UPFs) — typically anything edible that has more artificial ingredients than natural ones — to be cut completely from diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The UK is the worst in Europe for eating UPFs, which make up an estimated 57 per cent of the national diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are thought to be a key driver of obesity, which costs the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-bb30db50-6ab9-11ef-829f-25ad7d14ca00" class=""&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; around £6.5billion a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ready meals, ice cream and tomato ketchup are some of the best-loved examples of products that fall under the umbrella UPF term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are different from processed foods, which are altered to make them last longer or enhance their taste, such as cured meat, cheese and fresh bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Having kids around makes the holidays feel so much more magical, and it’s always fun to have a niece, nephew or grandchild that you can spoil. But when the baby is a newborn, it’s important that all relatives take safety precautions when seeing them.

openness and reactions about new baby and vaccines." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Skepticism around vaccines has been on the rise in recent years&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/bad-vaccine-takes-twitter/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vaccines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; are a divisive topic. Some of us are eager to keep up with all of our vaccinations and are first in line to get boosters when they roll out. But others are skeptical of how necessary vaccines really are. And some even believe that they cause more harm than good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to a 2024 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gallup Poll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, only 40% of Americans believe that it’s extremely important for parents to get their children vaccinated, and 69% say it’s very important. In 2001, however, 94% of Americans said it was very important for kids to be vaccinated, and 64% considered it to be extremely important. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the father who made this post pointed out in his text messages that he wasn’t trying to engage in a political discussion with his relatives, Gallup revealed that knowing someone’s political party might help you predict what their stance on vaccines will be. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;63% of Democrats believe vaccines are extremely important, while only a quarter of Republicans feel the same way. Meanwhile, only 36% of Republicans think the government should require vaccines, compared to over two thirds of Democrats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Skepticism about vaccines isn’t only an American issue, though.

So it’s important to exercise caution when visiting one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_2" align="center" data-pwa-ad="0" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-ad="empty"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/new-parents-and-newborns-are-visitors-ok#:~:text=Are%20newborns%20more%20susceptible%20to,such%20as%20sepsis%20and%20meningitis." target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Johns Hopkins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; notes on their blog that newborns are “at higher risk for developing infections from both bacteria and viruses. They are also more susceptible to developing serious infections, such as sepsis and meningitis.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To avoid passing whooping cough on to a newborn, it’s important for all visitors to be up to date with their Tdap vaccination. Johns Hopkins also recommends having a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;flu shot and making sure you’re up to date with COVID vaccinations and boosters at least two weeks before visiting a baby.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In general, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.baystatehealth.org/articles/guidelines-for-visiting-a-newborn" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Baystate Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; notes on their site that it’s probably safe for a newborn to start having visitors after about 3 months. But there are some rules to keep in mind. If anyone has been ill or exposed to illness in the past couple weeks, they should hold off on seeing the baby. It’s also important that they wash their hands well, and it might even be a good idea to wear a mask.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Never show up unannounced to visit a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/people-share-ugly-newborn-photos/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;&lt;span&gt;newborn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and if the parents have particular rules or wishes surrounding the visit, respect them. It’s always better to be safe than sorry, and at the end of the day, it’s up to Mom and Dad to decide who gets to spend time around their little one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We would love to hear your thoughts on this situation in the comments below, pandas.

A 100-year-old man, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em " data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr John Scharenberg,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; who has spent a lifetime studying health and wellness, shares seven key principles for longevity. These are not just theories but proven lifestyle habits that have helped many people avoid chronic diseases and stay active well into old age. Here is all we need to know about these life-changing principles that can help maintain good health for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avoid tobacco completely&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

He said in a TED Talks that the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.profiles.nlm.nih.gov/spotlight/nn/feature/smoking#:~:text=The%20report%20highlighted%20the%20deleterious,of%20smokers%20over%20non%2Dsmokers." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;1964 Surgeon General’s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; report made it clear that smoking is dangerous, yet many still struggle to quit. The doctor points out that people who avoid smoking live longer and are at a significantly lower risk of developing diseases like Alzheimer’s and heart attacks. Simply put, staying away from tobacco is one of the best decisions for longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mgid_country_osv_parent"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Say no to alcohol&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption has long been debated, but new research shows that even small amounts can increase health risks. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827822030616" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;large-scale study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; revealed that there is no truly “safe” level of alcohol. Even moderate drinking raises the risk of cancer, liver disease, and cardiovascular issues. While many believe a glass of wine is harmless, this doctor strongly advises cutting out alcohol altogether for better health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise every day&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sedentary lifestyle is one of the biggest risk factors for early death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/benefits/index.html#:~:text=Immediate%20benefits&amp;amp;text=Regular%20physical%20activity%20can%20help,of%20physical%20activity%20happen%20immediately." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Regular physical activity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; helps maintain heart health, strengthen muscles, and improve mental well-being. The doctor emphasizes that midlife (ages 40-70) is the most critical time to stay active. Those who exercise daily, regardless of their weight or health conditions, tend to outlive those who remain inactive. Walking, swimming, and strength training are all great ways to stay fit and add years to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Maintain a healthy weight&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity increases the risk of almost &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/adult-overweight-obesity/health-risks#:~:text=Having%20overweight%20or%20obesity%20increases,the%20cells%20in%20your%20body." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;every major disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. However, the doctor explains that even those who are overweight can improve their health dramatically through regular exercise. He also highlights that many people overeat due to food addiction, which is similar to substance addiction. Identifying the root cause of overeating and making conscious dietary changes can significantly improve health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cut down on sugar&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive sugar consumption has been linked to obesity, diabetes, and even heart attacks. Many people unknowingly consume too much sugar, whether through processed foods, sweetened beverages, or even daily desserts. The doctor shares a case study of a patient whose cholesterol and triglycerides skyrocketed due to a nightly habit of eating large amounts of ice cream. Cutting back on sugar can lead to better heart health, balanced energy levels, and overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reduce meat consumption&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A diet high in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2943062/#:~:text=Dietary%20saturated%20fat%20intake%20has,of%20cardiovascular%20disease%20(CVD)." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, particularly from animal sources, can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. While many are reluctant to give up meat, health organisations now recommend prioritising plant-based foods. The American Heart Association suggests reducing saturated fat intake, which effectively promotes a more plant-based diet. The doctor highlights that a vegetarian or plant-focused diet is scientifically proven to support longevity and lower disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;World health day: Doctors share strange questions they get asked by patients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Focus on preventive health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevention is better than cure. The doctor stresses that most chronic diseases, including heart attacks, strokes, and diabetes, can be prevented through lifestyle changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6378495/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; show that lifestyle modifications can lower heart attack risk, stroke risk and diabetes risk—without the need for medication. Organizations like the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/world-health-organisation" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and the European Cardiology Society support these findings, yet many people wait for a diagnosis before making changes. Taking proactive steps today can prevent major health issues in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9wFBVV95cUxPemxNNlh2N1laUGd2ZHU4Rmhwc1U0WHhQSkFTX3ZDcDZvUGVCWHBHOVNCT0p1bmVocGdHRk9tbVFqOUE3NzBVaWo5WG01dnc5bEN6c3hIM0FvSkkyQVZ6Z0NXT0tXeC1pR1pUVm1FMFR4N0N0bzIwRmhSY19lLWxnMkl4MmdkNGJ3YXp3WTdwSm9MT05pZGpOaEJrV2Y0YzFGbUpwZkZIb2dyN2hVMWtzVGdVbDhmUGxQcGhVb1NPZjVMYzRPZE9CaE9fQzZwYW95dFI1OXRjaEVJbV9NMUpyM3pWeDAwemtKX3dFWXpid09jZmZLOE80</guid></item><item><title>Can a Chatbot Be Your Therapist?

Researchers conducted a trial with 106 people who used Therabot, a smartphone app developed at Dartmouth over the past several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It's a small sample, but the researchers said it's the first clinical trial of an AI therapy chatbot. The results show significant advantages, mainly because the bot is available 24 hours a day, which bridges the immediacy gap patients face with traditional therapy. However researchers warn that &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/i-tried-ai-for-therapy-but-there-are-limits-to-its-conversations/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:generative AI-assisted therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;generative AI-assisted therapy&lt;/a&gt; can be perilous if not done right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I think there's a lot yet for this space to evolve," said Nick Jacobson, the study's senior author and an associate professor of biomedical data science and psychiatry at Dartmouth. "It's really amazing the potential for personalized, scalable impact."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/apples-ai-doctor-may-see-you-in-2026/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Apple's AI Doctor May See You in 2026;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Apple's AI Doctor May See You in 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;The Therabot study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The 210 participants were sorted into two groups -- one group of 106 was allowed to use the chatbot, while the control group was left on a "waiting list." The participants were evaluated for their anxiety, depression or eating disorder symptoms using standardized assessments before and after the test period. For the first four weeks, the app prompted its users to engage with it daily. For the second four weeks, the prompts stopped, but people could still engage on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Study participants actually used the app, and the researchers said they were surprised by how much and how closely people communicated with the bot. Surveyed afterward, participants reported a degree of "therapeutic alliance" -- trust and collaboration between patient and therapist -- similar to that for in-person therapists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The timing of interactions was also notable, with interactions spiking in the middle of the night and at other times when patients often experience concerns. Those are the hours when reaching a human therapist is particularly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"With Therabot, folks will access and did access it throughout the course of the trial in their daily life, in moments where they need it the most," Jacobson said. That included times when someone has difficulty getting to sleep at 2 a.m. because of anxiety or in the immediate wake of a difficult moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Patients' assessments afterward showed a 51% drop in symptoms for major depressive disorder, a 31% drop in symptoms for generalized anxiety disorder and a 19% drop in symptoms for eating disorders among patients at risk for those specific conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The people who were enrolled in the trial weren't just mild," Jacobson said. "The folks in the group were moderate to severe in depression, for example, as they started. But on average experienced a 50% reduction in their symptoms, which would go from severe to mild or moderate to nearly absent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What makes Therabot different&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The research team didn't just choose 100-plus people who needed support, give them access to a large language model like &lt;a href="https://tech.yahoo.com/general/articles/chatgpt-beginners-guide-133303426.html" data-ylk="slk:OpenAI's ChatGPT;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;OpenAI's ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; and see what happened. Therabot was custom-built -- fine-tuned -- to follow specific therapy procedures. It was built to watch out for serious concerns, like indications of potential &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/suicide-hotlines-crisis-hotlines-to-call-when-you-need-help/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:self-harm;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;self-harm&lt;/a&gt;, and report them so a human professional could intervene when needed. Humans also tracked the bot's communications to reach out when the bot said something it shouldn't have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Jacobson said during the first four weeks of the study, because of the uncertainty of how the bot would behave, he read every message it sent as soon as possible. "I did not get a whole lot of sleep in the first part of the trial," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Human interventions were rare, Jacobson said. Testing of earlier models two years ago showed more than 90% of responses were consistent with best practices. When the researchers did intervene, it was often when the bot offered advice outside of a therapist's scope -- as when it tried to provide more general medical advice like how to treat a sexually transmitted disease instead of referring the patient to a medical provider. "Its actual advice was all reasonable, but that's outside the realm of care we would provide."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Therabot isn't your typical large language model; it was essentially trained by hand. Jacobson said a team of more than 100 people created a dataset using best practices on how a therapist should respond to actual human experiences. "Only the highest quality data ends up being part of it," he said. A general model like &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/what-is-gemini-everything-you-should-know-about-googles-ai-tool/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Google's Gemini;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Google's Gemini&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/claude-ai-review-the-most-conversational-ai-engine/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anthropic's Claude;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Anthropic's Claude&lt;/a&gt;, for example, is trained on far more data than just medical literature and may respond improperly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Can generative AI be your therapist?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Dartmouth study is an early sign that specially built tools using generative AI can be helpful in some cases, but that doesn't mean any AI chatbot can be your therapist. This was a controlled study with human experts monitoring it, and there are dangers in trying this on your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Remember that most general large language models are trained on oceans of data found on the internet. So, while they can sometimes provide some good mental health guidance, they also include bad information -- like how fictional therapists behaved, or what people posted about mental health on online forums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"There's a lot of ways they behave in profoundly unsafe ways in health settings," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even a chatbot offering helpful advice might be &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/popular-ai-tools-can-hurt-your-mental-health-new-study-finds/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:harmful in the wrong setting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;harmful in the wrong setting&lt;/a&gt;. Jacobson said if you tell a chatbot you're trying to lose weight, it will come up with ways to help you. But if you're dealing with an eating disorder, that may be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many people are already using chatbots to &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/tried-ai-companion-help-process-130005355.html" data-ylk="slk:perform tasks that approximate the work of a therapist;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;perform tasks that approximate the work of a therapist&lt;/a&gt;. Jacobson says you should be careful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"There's a lot of things about it in terms of the way it's trained that very closely mirrors the quality of the internet," he said.

But, a &lt;a href="https://publichealth.realclearjournals.org/perspectives/2025/03/a-blueprint-for-nih-reform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;paper published last week&lt;/a&gt;, called “A Blueprint for NIH Reform,” is circulating in academic circles as well as within the National Institutes of Health, as scientists search for hints of where the agency may go in the coming months and years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The paper has attracted a spotlight because it was written by Martin Kulldorff, a collaborator of the agency’s new director, Jay Bhattacharya, who is also on the editorial board of the publication, called the Journal of the Academy of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The blueprint has 12 proposals for the agency, which range from breaking it into pieces to changing the ways researchers are funded to conducting more long-term studies to the creation of a “Covid Commission” to investigate the agency’s handling of the pandemic.  As a whole, the proposal is something of a referendum on the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think that NIH failed us during the pandemic, and to restore trust in science, we have to change the way we operate as a scientific community, and have to change the NIH, and I think one key aspect is to be more open and transparent and have open scientific discourse,” Kulldorff said in an interview.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts on science policy who reviewed the paper for STAT said it largely relitigates the NIH’s performance during the pandemic, and is at times correct in its diagnoses of problems at the agency but is biased by Kulldorff’s personal experience. During the pandemic, Kulldorff and Bhattacharya were criticized for writing &lt;a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Great Barrington Declaration&lt;/a&gt;, an open letter they co-authored that challenged the need for most social distancing efforts and called for less stringent public health measures in the first year of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think we shouldn’t be Covid-obsessed when we think about NIH reform, and this set of proposals is. It makes sense given who the author is, right? He has an ax to grind, and I don’t blame him for having an ax to grind, but that ends up coloring the tenor of what reform would look like,” said Pierre Azoulay, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has studied the NIH and &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/04/opinion/national-institutes-health-reforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;advocated for reform&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Several of the proposals line up with policies already put forth by the Trump administration. The paper calls for the same payment rate for indirect research costs for all institutions, a measure that the administration attempted to implement but that has been halted for now by a federal judge. It also emphasizes “academic freedom and open scientific discourse.” In an email to staff on his first day in office, Bhattacharya lists “academic freedom” as one of his top five priorities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The paper also proposes basing decisions about making large grants on the applicant’s previous research, as opposed to proposed experiments, and providing training funding directly to universities to disburse, rather than have these awards be judged by an NIH panel. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The experts who spoke with STAT supported the idea of minimizing the time that researchers spend writing grant proposals and justifying funding. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“​​Researchers spend way too much time just chasing after money,” said Stuart Buck, the executive director of the Good Science Project, a science policy think tank. “If you look at some of the best places that did research historically, like Bell Labs, scientists had a job, they had funding, it was centrally funded. They didn’t have to spend half their time writing up proposals for why they deserved money and deserve to get a salary and deserve to have a little lab space and so forth.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But making NIH funding dependent on a researcher’s previous “first-author” publications, as Kullfdorff proposed, could also create inequities in who can apply for those funds. This approach is similar to how the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which attempts to fund bold and innovative research, makes funding decisions. But, there are also biases in who is funded by the HHMI, the largest private funder of biomedical research, the experts said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The best predictor of whether you get a Hughes position is whether you work in the lab of somebody else who had a Hughes position, or whether you work in the lab of somebody who is in the National Academy of Sciences. So there’s a huge bias toward the in crowd,” said Jeremy Berg, an associate dean and professor at the University of Pittsburgh who previously led the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at NIH. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Berg and others noted that in areas they agreed with the proposal, like requiring projects with NIH funding to have open data, or requiring publication in journals with open peer-review, there was little reference to previously published research that examined the pros and cons of similar reform ideas. “It’s relatively easy to pose the problem, and say, ‘We just need to do this.’ Then when you actually try to think about how you would do that, it turns out that it’s flawed, and leads to all kinds of unintended consequences, and is basically unworkable,” Berg said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In particular, some outside experts were concerned about proposals that could signal retribution toward the NIH and others that disagreed with Bhattacharya and Kulldorff during the pandemic. In writing about academic freedom, Kulldorff writes that individuals should not be discriminated against on factors including vaccination history, ethical convictions, and political beliefs. That section ends by saying, “Digressions during the pandemic should be rectified.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This looks like it was a setup to punish organizations, institutions and individuals that did things during the pandemic that they don’t like,” said Keith Yamamoto, vice chancellor of science policy and strategy at the University of California, San Francisco, who recently led a group who wrote a report on &lt;a href="https://online.flippingbook.com/view/492769090/2/#zoom=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;optimizing the NIH&lt;/a&gt;. “I worry that this is a call for retribution for people who didn’t agree with what Bhattacharya wanted to do to open up society during the pandemic.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berg said former colleagues at the NIH have been passing around the blueprint, to understand what changes might be coming to the agency. When asked if he had discussed the paper with Bhattacharya, Kulldorff responded, “you have to ask him what he thinks about these proposals.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Bhattacharya and the NIH did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, given Bhattacharya’s connections to Killdorff and the journal, researchers have continued speculating. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you told me this is what’s getting implemented, I’d be very worried. I think that they’re not, in their current form, particularly helpful,” Azoulay said. “Of course, everyone who reads this is wondering, ‘Is this what Jay thinks? If that’s the case, then we worry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Influencers rave and promote them, all across social media. No wonder why the vitamin industry is booming. But do you really need all these supplements? Do they have side effects? While there is no dispute about the fact that vitamins are essential for our overall health, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/4-vitamins-whose-deficiencies-are-the-most-dangerous-and-worrisome/photostory/119864155.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; may pose some undesirable side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jaban Moore, a functional medicine doctor, based in Kansas City, who has a holistic approach towards health and medicine has revealed about the vitamin supplements he personally avoids. Dr. Moore has nearly 700k followers on Instagram. In a video shared on the platform, he spoke about the vitamins he stays away from. “Vitamins I would never take as a functional medicine doctor. The supplement world isn’t as different as big pharma sometimes. Read the labels to know what you’re taking.,” Dr. Moore warns. He also suggests some alternatives to the popular vitamins. Take a look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong " data-ua-type="1"&gt;Vitamin B12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first vitamin supplement on Dr. Moore’s list is &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/forget-vitamin-d-this-is-what-just-20-minutes-of-sunlight-does-to-the-body/articleshow/119890213.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Vitamin B12 is essential for keeping your central nervous system healthy and supports the production of DNA and red blood cells, as well as maintains typical brain function. You can naturally get vitamin B12 from animal foods, such as meat, fish, clams, poultry, milk, and eggs. Among these, organ meats, such as liver and kidneys are high in vitamin B12. Clams also contain large amounts of vitamin B12. You can also incorporated fortified cereals, fortified nurtitional yeast, and fortified nondairy milk to meet the nutritional needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mgid_country_osv_parent"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jaban Moore suggests not taking cyanocobalamin, which is a synthetic form of B12. “Don't use cyanocobalamin, a synthetic form of b12 that contains cyanide, requiring extra detoxification. Take methylcobalamin instead,” he suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Have you ever experienced side effects from vitamin supplements?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="strong " data-ua-type="1"&gt;Magnesium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium is an essential mineral that is best for various functions, including muscle and nerve function, bone health, blood sugar regulation, sleep, and improving mood. Magnesium is found in a variety of nutrient-dense foods, such as whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, and several fruits and vegetables. Magnesium helps to lessen your chance of high blood pressure. Several studies have linked increased increased magnesium levels with heart disease. “Don't use Magnesium oxide or citrate unless you only want the laxative properties. To replenish magnesium levels, opt for magnesium glycinate,” Dr. Moore says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While magnesium is essential for health, taking too much can lead to side effects, such as diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and nausea. Excessive magnesium, especially in forms like magnesium oxide or citrate, can act as a laxative, causing digestive issues. High magnesium levels can also lower blood pressure, potentially leading to dizziness or fainting, and in severe cases, may cause irregular heart rhythms. Individuals with kidney disease should be particularly cautious, as impaired kidney function can lead to a dangerous buildup of magnesium in the body. To avoid these issues, it's important to stick to recommended dosages and consult with a healthcare provider before starting supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Indian Youth &amp;amp; Mental Health: BK Shivani Reveals The Truth About Depression&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="strong " data-ua-type="1"&gt;Iron &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron is another essential nutrient, which is in charge of several important functions such as carrying oxygen throughout your body as part of red blood cells. A lack of iron can lead to iron deficiency anaemia. Anaemia can results in symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, dizziness and shortness of breath, among others. Anaemia is a serious global public health problem that particularly affects young children, menstruating adolescent girls and women, and pregnant and postpartum women. Red meat, beans, nuts, spinach, dried fruits like apricot, and liver and organ meat are rich in iron. Dr. Moore suggests, “Don't use ferrous sulfate (iron).” He says that this supplement is harsh on digestion, and can cause constipation and nausea. “Ferrous bisglycinate (iron) is gentler and better absorbed, and heme iron is the most bioavailable form,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While vitamins play a crucial role in maintaining health, it's important to be cautious when selecting supplements, as they can have potential side effects. It is important to read labels and be mindful of the ingredients in supplements. Opting for natural alternatives may be a safer and more effective approach to supporting overall wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 07:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Intermittent fasting or calorie deficit diet, which is better for weight loss? - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are on a weight loss journey, it's no secret that you are constantly looking for effective diet and workout strategies. The internet is flooded with millions of restrictive diets and hard-hitting workouts. But how do you know what’s better for you? Curating what works for you is indeed crucial. But everyone with weight loss goals must have come across interesting fasting and calorie-deficit diets. Which one is better? Well, scientists have finally unraveled the mystery. A new study has found that intermittent fasting provides greater weight loss than traditional daily calorie-restrictive diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers from the University of Colorado School of Medicine published their findings in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-01631" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed that the 4:3 plan, a popular type of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/intermittent-fasting-what-are-the-best-hours-for-intermittent-fasting/articleshow/117051664.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; (IMF), where individuals eat freely for four days a week and follow intense calorie restriction for three days a week, had an average body weight loss of 7.6% at the one-year mark compared with 5% in the daily caloric restriction (DCR) group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though previous studies have looked into both intermittent and calorie deficit diets, they reported no notable difference between the two diet strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was surprising and exciting to me that it was better,” Victoria Catenacci, MD, co-lead author and associate professor of endocrinology at the CU School of Medicine said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more important message to me is that this is a dietary strategy that is an evidence-based alternative, especially for people who have tried DCR and found it difficult,” Catenacci added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find the best diet, the researchers randomly assigned 165 adults with overweight or obesity to either &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mgid_country_osv_parent"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4:3 intermittent fasting or calorie restriction for 12 months. Participants in the 4:3 intermittent fasting group fasted three nonconsecutive days a week, reducing their calorie intake by 80% on those days.

They also got group support, calorie counting guidance, and dietary recommendations (to target 55% carbs, 15% protein, and 30% fat).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;How to lose weight through intermittent fasting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the year, participants in the intermittent fasting group had a 7.6% change in body weight. The calorie deficit group only exhibited a 5% change. 58% of those in the fasting group achieved weight loss of at least 5% at 12 months vs 47% in the calorie restriction group. Individuals in the IMF achieved great cardiometabolic outcomes including systolic blood pressure, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and fasting glucose levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also stressed that fasting does not require counting calories, and restrictive diets every single day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 06:43:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Measles updates, lorazepam risks and antibiotics breakthrough - Fox News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOa2Y5SXhsczMwQTRmOG96ZFJaNHEtZFZyOXc0QzRsZ3A3eE1KLXdra3hJQ0h0WGNfdE81VnJxVTN5aGVFckRLZGtPU0dGQ3dWOGR3akFPc191enVnbHViX0otR1QyU2lBVHpYZmMwS2FzZ0dFdW1lRGFiaHBaZHNhVlc3VnJTR0YtbjgtOFN5V2vSAZYBQVVfeXFMT0s0TWtDcTR3ODB3bFpuM3Q5SjdWc0V0ZEdwalpOOXEtNDdneWhZQnpnektjQVNtV0NPaGtGLXRBUURXWklHa3M3SzZCRDROUkVTS3ZocTRjaHVScUo5ZUlsZlZjb091N2p2TWpxOUdtRWptaW9BVTFPb2tGcDBJRnhrYkJ3MVlIbnpDWDNiWWQ3SldsTGR3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fox News</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 04:09:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxOa2Y5SXhsczMwQTRmOG96ZFJaNHEtZFZyOXc0QzRsZ3A3eE1KLXdra3hJQ0h0WGNfdE81VnJxVTN5aGVFckRLZGtPU0dGQ3dWOGR3akFPc191enVnbHViX0otR1QyU2lBVHpYZmMwS2FzZ0dFdW1lRGFiaHBaZHNhVlc3VnJTR0YtbjgtOFN5V2vSAZYBQVVfeXFMT0s0TWtDcTR3ODB3bFpuM3Q5SjdWc0V0ZEdwalpOOXEtNDdneWhZQnpnektjQVNtV0NPaGtGLXRBUURXWklHa3M3SzZCRDROUkVTS3ZocTRjaHVScUo5ZUlsZlZjb091N2p2TWpxOUdtRWptaW9BVTFPb2tGcDBJRnhrYkJ3MVlIbnpDWDNiWWQ3SldsTGR3</guid></item><item><title>OSDH confirms measles case in OKC, identifies potential exposure site - News on 6</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxOUkMwbG8ydWVwaW9iR1hHMHZoN3NRNlRSSlZabVNITjdnYTVvU05sMU9abENFck9oanJjaVBoVVRJMG9jalBhTVB2RlpZaTFONEdyLU45VDJVSHVKc2xfZXQ3ZTBObWZZZ28wTl9LRXh1UkJfVlEwR1dOQkdRN2FDOFZUNktxbUpaODZZMHBRNEdKZklzalpmcGEyb211X1Z2bm51OUJJRTB3V1BfR2o3QzhuaWZubVlDREZPZkFacDM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnm-article gnm-ty-article"&gt;

Hydration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the gastroenterologist, chia seeds absorb up to 12 times their weight in water. This helps you stay &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/want-hair-that-is-soft-fresh-shiny-ultra-hydrated-while-travelling-follow-these-5-tips-101742549940078.html"&gt;hydrated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Digestion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from hydration, they are also packed with fibre and omega-3 fatty acids. Their high fibre content makes them great for digestion, which can help you ‘feel fuller for longer’.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Weight management&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another benefit of eating chia seeds regularly is that it can assist you in weight management as it helps you feel fuller.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Radiant skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, explaining chia seeds' benefits for your skin, Dr Sethi said, “Chia seeds provide hydration and antioxidants that can benefit your skin as well. So, you may notice subtle improvements in your skin texture and radiance.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now that you know the benefits of eating chia seeds, it is also important to know the correct way to consume them. Eating it dry could lead to health complications. Recently, in an &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/are-you-eating-chia-seeds-the-wrong-way-doctor-explains-the-right-way-of-consuming-the-superfood-101742614879713.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual"&gt;Instagram video&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Kunal Sood, double board-certified MD, shared the proper method for incorporating chia seeds into your diet. “Soak chia seeds for about 10 to 15 minutes before eating. Start with small amounts and ensure you drink enough water to prevent digestive discomfort, as chia seeds absorb moisture from your body,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Emily, 48, and Ashley, 44 - who have spent the last two weeks at their father's side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Wayne sits in a reclining chair where he spends most of his days. Terminally ill, he is too weak to leave the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He has invited BBC News to witness his death under California's assisted dying laws - because if MPs in London vote to legalise the practice in England and Wales, it will allow some terminally ill people here to die in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Half an hour after arriving at Wayne's house, I watch him swallow three anti-nausea tablets, designed to minimise the risk of him vomiting the lethal medication he plans to take shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Are you sure this day is your last, I ask him? "I'm all in," he replies. "I was determined and decided weeks ago - I've had no trepidation since then."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;His family ask for one last photo, which I take. As usual, Stella and Wayne are holding hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Shortly after, Dr Donnie Moore arrives. He has got to know the family over the past few weeks, visiting them on several occasions alongside running his own end-of-life clinic. Under California law, he is what is known as the attending physician who must confirm, in addition to a second doctor, that Wayne is eligible for aid in dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Moore's role is part physician, part counsellor in this situation, one he has been in for 150 assisted deaths before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;On a top shelf in Wayne's bedroom sits a brown glass bottle containing a fine white powder - a mixture of five drugs, sedatives and painkillers, delivered to the house the previous day. The dosage of drugs inside is hundreds of times higher than those used in regular healthcare and is "guaranteed" to be fatal, Dr Moore explains. Unlike California, the proposed law at Westminster would require a doctor to bring any such medication with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Dr Donnie Moore has been involved in dozens of assisted deaths&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;When Wayne signals he is ready, the doctor mixes the meds with cherry and pineapple juice to soften the bitter taste - and he hands this pink liquid to Wayne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;No one, not even the doctor, knows how long it will take him to die after taking the lethal drugs. Dr Moore explains to me that, in his experience, death usually occurs between 30 minutes and two hours of ingestion, but on one occasion it took 17 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This is the story of how and why Wayne chose to die. And why others have decided not to follow the same course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;We first met the couple a few weeks earlier, when Wayne explained why he was going ahead with the decision to have an assisted death - a controversial measure in other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Some days the pain is almost more than I can handle," he said. "I just don't see any merit to dying slow and painfully, hooked up with stuff - intubation, feeding tubes," he told me. "I want none of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Wayne said he had watched two relatives die "miserable", "heinous" deaths from heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I hate hospitals, they are miserable. I will die in the street first."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Wayne met Stella in 1969; the couple married four years later. He told us it was something of an arranged marriage, as his mother kept inviting Stella for dinner until eventually the penny dropped that he should take her out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They lived for many years in Arcata, northern California, surrounded by sweeping forests of redwood trees, where Wayne worked as a landscape architect, while Stella was a primary school teacher. They spent their holidays hiking and camping with their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Now Wayne is terminally ill with heart failure, which has already brought him close to death. He has myriad other health issues including prostate cancer, liver failure and sepsis which brings him serious spinal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He has less than six months to live, qualifying him for an assisted death in California. His request to die has been approved by two doctors and the lethal medication is self-administered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It was during our first meeting that he asked the BBC to return to observe his final day, saying he wanted terminally ill adults in the UK to have the same right to an assisted death as him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Wayne sits surrounded by his family on the day of his death&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Britain is pretty good with freedoms and this is just another one," he said. "People should be able to choose the time of their death as long as they meet the rules like six months to live or less."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Stella, 78, supports his decision. "I've known him for over 50 years. He's a very independent man. He's always known what he wants to do and he's always fixed things. That's how he's operating now. If this is his choice, I definitely agree, and I've seen him really suffer with the illness he's got. I don't want that for him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Wayne would also qualify under the proposed new assisted dying law in England and Wales. The measures return to the House of Commons later this month, when all MPs will have a chance to debate and vote on changes to the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The proposed legislation, tabled by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, says that anyone who wants to end their life must have the mental capacity to make the choice, that they must be expected to die within six months, and must make two separate declarations - witnessed and signed - about their wish to die. They must satisfy two independent doctors that they are eligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;MPs in Westminster voted in favour of assisted dying in principle last November but remain bitterly divided on the issue. If they ultimately decide to approve the bill, it could become law within the next year and come into practice within the next four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;There are also divisions here in California, where assisted dying was introduced in 2016. Michelle and Mike Carter, both 72 and married for 43 years, are each being treated for cancer - Mike has prostate cancer that has spread to his lymph nodes, and Michelle's advanced terminal ovarian cancer has spread throughout much of her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I held my mother's hand when she passed; I held my father's hand when he passed," Michelle told me. "I believe there's freedom of choice however for me, I choose palliative care… I have God and I have good medicine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Michelle Carter is placing her trust in medicine&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Michelle's physician, palliative care specialist Dr Vincent Nguyen, argued that assisted dying laws in the US state lead to "silent coercion" whereby vulnerable people think their only option is to die. "Instead of ending people's lives, let's put programmes together to care for people," he said. "Let them know that they're loved, they're wanted and they're worthy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He said the law meant that doctors have gone from being seen as healers to killers, while the message from the healthcare system was that "you are better off dead, because you're expensive and your death is cheaper for us".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some disability campaigners say assisted dying makes them feel unsafe. Ingrid Tischer, who has muscular dystrophy and chronic respiratory failure, told me: "The message that it sends to people with disabilities in California is that you deserve suicide assistance rather than suicide prevention when you voice a desire to end your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"What does that say about who we are as a culture?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Critics often say that once assisted dying is legalised, over time the safeguards around such laws get eroded as part of a "slippery slope" towards more relaxed criteria. In California, there was initially a mandatory 15-day cooling off period between patients making a first and second request for aid in dying. That has been reduced to 48 hours because many patients were dying during the waiting period. It's thought the approval process envisaged in Westminster would take around a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Goodbye,' Wayne tells his family&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Outside Wayne's house on the morning of his death, a solitary bird begins its loud and elaborate song. "There's that mockingbird out there," Wayne tells Stella, as smiles flicker across their faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Wayne hates the bird because it keeps him awake at night, Stella jokes, hand in hand with him to one side of his chair. Emily and Ashley are next to Stella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Moore, seated on Wayne's other side, hands him the pink liquid which he swallows without hesitation. "Goodnight," he says to his family - a typical touch of humour from a man who told us he was determined to die on his terms. It's 11.47am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;After two minutes, Wayne says he is getting sleepy. Dr Moore asks him to imagine he is walking in a vast sea of flowers with a soft breeze on his skin, which seems appropriate for a patient who has spent much of his life among nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;After three minutes Wayne enters a deep sleep from which he will never wake. On a few occasions he lifts his head to take a deep breath without opening his eyes, at one point beginning to snore softly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Moore tells the family this is "the deepest sleep imaginable" and reassures Emily there is no chance her dad will wake up and ask, "did it work?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Oh that would be just like him," Stella says with a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Wayne and his family shortly before his death&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The family start to reminisce about hiking holidays and driving around in a large van they converted to become a camper. "Me and dad insulated it and put a bed in the back," says Ashley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;On the walls are photos of Emily and Ashley as small children next to huge carved Halloween pumpkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Moore is still stroking Wayne's hand and occasionally checking his pulse. For a man who Emily says was "always walking, always outdoors, always active", these are the final moments of life's journey, spent surrounded by those who mean most to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At 12.22pm Dr Moore says, "I think he's passed… He's at peace now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Outside, the mockingbird has fallen silent. "No more pain," says Stella, embracing her children in her arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;I step outside to give the family some space, and reflect on what we have just seen and filmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;I have been covering medical ethics for the BBC for more than 20 years. In 2006, I was present just outside an apartment in Zurich where Dr Anne Turner, a retired doctor, died with the help of the group Dignitas - but California was the first time I had been an eyewitness to an assisted death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This isn't just a story about one man's death in California - it's about what could become a reality here in England and Wales for those who qualify for an assisted death and choose to die this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Whether you're for or against the proposed new Westminster law, the death of a loved one is a deeply personal and emotional time for a family. Each death leaves an imprint, as will Wayne's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;i id="additional-reporting-by-josh-falcon" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Additional reporting by Josh Falcon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 23:14:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5oeHkwRDU2bjhaQ2E4aF9YOWxOWHM0VmJkd0RtV3Q3SzFtZHE2eERMWXFCMnlkTUd4Zks1aF85OVU4T21Dcm5GYVY2TFNodjRMSWpJb1M2dmFmQdIBX0FVX3lxTE5ZQVhLa2lTd0NnU094UlpGM2JSWXpoUHZMaWlMSjBOdE95RTBFaWF0cjJBTXdaa1gzSGp1Vko3LVFSQWdUUFpQLUtXYVJidGdTVk1JQzhmSksyS3pVaktJ</guid></item><item><title>The shingles vaccine prevents a painful disease, but it might also ward off dementia - OregonLive.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxOOWQtcHJ4cFpjV2dWb2VtS3hfcHAwLVgxNEs5aW1jeU5QN1dTTUFLYUVwTUl1cU14ZjFhMXFOR2RYNDFpZjRUOW10R3ctaTRQa2htT2NwUUI1WUtqNVhGekcwSnoxTWNhWHRwdlJkalJoRllVWm1XaW5tNTh0TjVDQ2dYTWZ4QXFUYmVURDNvcjVKYTFlZi16dGc3OXJseXFpcHF3RlJFU1NHRGMwd0FWbUM3b2pqWnVDMXVfeGdYTlBsQVpEVlZoX2tR0gHeAUFVX3lxTE1hYlE3elViQTJVbDM5YWtZQVhGUW1naUlEMENlbXV2MG1CclEwODc5Z091QlVKLXFxaHFoNjRoQk9WQ0lmelZmQXBmM1EzMFhVRHJleTJkdWlCSVk0RWFILWs4ZUZ3Q2RtYVE5STQzNTFISjBTajVQaWhWLVppQTVocnJOd09BUlRnVmd3MGRqR0JsRTJvN1BMdDQ1aFg3RmQ4aGNUYkZjdUt4WFRsX2xvUHNiX2RmajFWNUh2dGpqVVBoUGJOYjBoVXZaRlZGTmJ5SDM5ZzdGTFYzOUdwZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ISGNBTQHFVELTJBUNKKAIT24WE"&gt;A vaccine to fight dementia?

And “women seem to benefit more,” important as &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-b86a1425061641518a25bcfcc99e08cc" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;they’re at higher risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2FC7V4FTINHBJLUEXRTAB3V2GA"&gt;The study tracked people in Wales who were around 80 when receiving the world’s first-generation shingles vaccine over a decade ago. Now, Americans &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;50 and older&lt;/a&gt; are urged to get a newer vaccine that’s proven more effective against shingles than its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LMTFHDEU2NDIZIWPVNYGUK2CJY"&gt;The new findings add another reason for people to consider rolling up their sleeves, said Dr. Maria Nagel of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, who studies viruses that infiltrate the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5CQFLSFEMBFVNFSWM6LCCOHZQQ"&gt;The virus “is a risk for dementia and now we have an intervention that can decrease the risk,” Nagel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Z7GMBGG4IREDXFCJNX6OLYALFY"&gt;With Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia on the rise in an aging population, “the implications of the study are profound,” Dr. Anupam Jena, a Harvard physician and health economist, wrote in a Nature commentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;What is shingles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OY7QV3DV7NFVJEX42LOTUKJ564"&gt;Anyone who’s had ever had chickenpox – nearly everybody born before 1980 – harbors that virus for the rest of their life. It hides in nerves and can break out when the immune system weakens from illness or age, causing painful, blister-like sores typically on one side of the body that last for weeks – what’s called shingles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RTVJKAWGT5BKNI45HGEAZXIPBE"&gt;About 1 in 3 Americans will get shingles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While most recover, it sometimes causes &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/dianne-feinstein-shingles-complications-encephalitis-0b89e58478eb8f1785886ed9a9eda801" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;severe complications.&lt;/a&gt; If it infects an eye it can cause vision loss. Up to 20% of shingles patients suffer excruciating nerve pain months or even years after the rash itself is gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;What’s the link between shingles and dementia?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ABEFGVXMW5BFXL2OLRRRN6YJ6E"&gt;It’s not clear exactly how Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia form. But certain viruses that sneak inside the nervous system – especially members of the herpes family including the chickenpox virus -- have long been suspected of adding to genetic and other factors that make people more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="COTAPUP7LVGUJI4EXN7G7SQCJI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-024-01511-x" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Last summer&lt;/a&gt;, doctors at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital reported that an episode of shingles could raise someone’s risk of dementia by about 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LOM7RI4WXRDAJEOVJL4REG52IE"&gt;Partly, it’s because that virus can cause inflammation, bad for organs including the brain. It also can directly infect blood vessels in the brain, causing clots and impeding blood flow, said Colorado’s Nagel, a risk both for strokes and for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YU4MW6UCXNBWVLH4PXH73ZTJVU"&gt;More intriguing, her lab also discovered shingles can spur formation of a sticky protein called amyloid that’s one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;Do shingles vaccines protect against dementia?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4NU445RV6FECBIRPWPCIQS4G3Y"&gt;Adults who get recommended vaccines tend to have other brain-healthy habits including exercising and a good diet, which made it hard to prove an extra benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7RP2TFWQUFDCTBR4L467RHGM7A"&gt;Stanford’s Geldsetzer took advantage of “a natural experiment” in Wales, which opened shingles vaccinations with an age limit: anyone 80 or older on Sept. 1, 2013, was ineligible but those still 79 could squeeze in. Comparing seniors who just met or just missed that cutoff would mimic a research study that randomly assigned otherwise similar people to be vaccinated or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ORXOCWPTYNH3RF4CREW4ILG2AA"&gt;Geldsetzer’s team analyzed more than 280,000 medical records and found evidence that vaccination did offer some protection against dementia. At the time, people received a first-generation vaccine called Zostavax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VAZZEHLBWBG43K54RIIDT5VS24"&gt;An important next step is testing whether today’s vaccine, Shingrix, also offers dementia protection, Nagel said. Another research group recently reported some evidence that it does. Vaccine manufacturer GSK last month announced a collaboration with UK health officials to track seniors’ cognitive health as they get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XQ5M6DJHY5FJ7KWHO7JXBDNOF4"&gt;Geldsetzer also hopes to further study that earlier shot to see if the type of vaccine might make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;What are the shingles vaccine recommendations?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DMI3HN5Q45EB7HDPZAKQRZBFKA"&gt;Shingrix is a onetime vaccination, given in two doses a few months apart. The CDC recommends it starting at age 50 for most people but also for younger adults with certain immune-weakening conditions – including those who years ago got that first-generation shingles vaccine. Fewer than 40% of eligible Americans have gotten vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-24"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ADIDDELFFRDXLDUCBYWNOUO4XA"&gt;Side effects including injection-site pain and flu-like fever and achiness are common. The CDC cautions if you’re currently fighting another virus such as the flu or COVID-19, to wait on a shingles shot until you’re well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZTCU6FJI3JFNJHZ5XI37ZPIUWE"&gt;While there’s no proven prevention for dementia, doctors also recommend other commonsense steps to lower the risk. Stay socially and cognitively active. And control high blood pressure and, for people with diabetes, high blood sugar, both of which are linked to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CXGRLEN5J5HFZOORRI4BAPI7DU" data-fusion-component="CXGRLEN5J5HFZOORRI4BAPI7DU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CXGRLEN5J5HFZOORRI4BAPI7DU" data-fusion-component="CXGRLEN5J5HFZOORRI4BAPI7DU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-27"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XSHXECY5TFE4NCNFO7BKDHT24M"&gt;&lt;i&gt;-- Lauran Neergaard, The Associated Press&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-28"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="W6CKBVQSYRDKBOMLIH5VJ7UBRE"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

He was losing hair, revealing patches of black skin underneath. Evidently itchy, he was scratching and rubbing himself against his enclosure. Kathryn Gamble, the zoo's director of veterinary medicine, had a hunch what was wrong: allergies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But what would a polar bear be allergic to? Gamble and her colleagues anaesthetized Siku and conducted a skin test, injecting small amounts of various allergy-provoking substances into his skin. Siku's skin reacted against house mites, as well as elm, mulberry and red cedar pollen.

"I wouldn't be surprised if more zoo animals [are getting] allergies too," she adds – although no research has yet looked into whether or not this is the case.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Allergy symptoms can vary across animals. Humans and other primates that inhale allergy-causing substances through the nose often develop hay fever-type symptoms, with discharge, sneezing and weepy eyes. But most animals absorb allergy-provoking substances through the skin and develop skin conditions, says Andrew Rosenberg, a veterinary dermatologist and director of medical operations at the Animal Dermatology Group, a US-based veterinary company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l1qbh8.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l1qbh8.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l1qbh8.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l1qbh8.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l1qbh8.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l1qbh8.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l1qbh8.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l1qbh8.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l1qbh8.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l1qbh8.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Experts say allergies in dogs are on the rise too, with flea and environmental allergies more common than food allergies (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Experts say allergies in dogs are on the rise too, with flea and environmental allergies more common than food allergies (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The cats Rosenberg sees will often scratch their face and neck, tear out hair, or develop pink plaques or crusted pimples on their bodies.

While some experts used to solely blame the fact that humans are increasingly growing up in cleaner, more hygienic environments where they're less exposed to microbes than in the wild, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.2147/ITT.S61528" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;research is now pointing&lt;/a&gt; to a wider set of factors that also involves the loss of important microbes and parasites that live in and on our bodies, says Andrea Graham, a parasitologist at Princeton University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;It may be that zoo animals are so well cared for they develop allergies as a side effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Frequent cleaning and soaps likely contributes to our reduced exposure to these organisms, alongside the use of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-020-00432-2" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;antibiotic drugs&lt;/a&gt; and ointments, greater distancing from domesticated animals and parasite-free food, Graham says.

Now, without these organisms to rein in and train our immune response, our immune system is more likely to go into overdrive, including against harmless pathogens, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some of the best evidence for this theory comes from studies of Amish populations in the US. One 2016 &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1508749" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; compared Amish children in Indiana state, who use traditional farming practices and are exposed to lots of microbes through interactions with farm animals and house dust, with children from Hutterite communities in South Dakota, who use highly industrialised farming practices and live in households less exposed to dust and animals. Though both populations were genetically very similar, "the rate of allergies was about four times higher in the Hutterites who had taken on modern industrial farming", says Andrew Flies, an immunologist at the University of Tasmania's Menzies Institute for Medical Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l1qbmj.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l1qbmj.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l1qbmj.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l1qbmj.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l1qbmj.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l1qbmj.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l1qbmj.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l1qbmj.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l1qbmj.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l1qbmj.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Rhinoceroses in captivity have also been found to have developed allergies, including severe rashes, bloody ulcerations and weeping infections (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Rhinoceroses in captivity have also been found to have developed allergies, including severe rashes, bloody ulcerations and weeping infections (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Flies, Petersen, Graham and Rosenberg all suspect that animals kept in households, farms and zoos might develop allergies for similar reasons. They typically get dewormed and vaccinated to prevent infections, and are generally less exposed to the bacteria and parasites they evolved with compared to their relatives in the wild, Graham says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;For zoo animals, Petersen says, "the food they're eating is parasite-free and probably not heavily bacterially contaminated". Compare that to a bacteria-smothered cadaver a lion would eat in the Serengeti, probably together with the prey's microbe- and parasite-containing guts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In other words, it may be that animals are so well cared for in zoos they develop allergies as a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While no-one has yet published a specific study looking into this, Flies and others suspect that allergies are much more common in these more human environments than in the wilderness. In the wild, allergies might affect the survival of animals – for instance if allergic animals scratch themselves and develop infections, Flies says. Petersen recalls a lion with allergies she once treated who had developed a bad ear infection. "If he can't hear well in the wild – if the ears are plugged with pus and stuff from the infection – that would obviously be a major disadvantage," she says. For these reasons, allergies may have disappeared from wild populations.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But that theory is tough to prove. Animals in the wild may well have allergies, Gamble says – but we would be less likely to spot them.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;What may have contributed to Siku's allergies, Gamble adds, is the fact that he had been moved to Chicago two years before he started developing them. Often, "if a person moves to a new environment where they're exposed to pollens that their bodies have never seen before, they have a response to it," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Other factors may also be contributing to allergies in animals. Rosenberg says that in his clinic in the northeastern US, where he's seen rising cases of pet allergies, this may be linked to climate change, which is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28764-0" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;causing&lt;/a&gt; higher pollen counts and longer allergy seasons. "It's my impression that we're seeing more common allergies and we're seeing more severe allergies than ever before," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;As awareness around animal allergies is growing, so is knowledge on how to treat them. Rosenberg was able to treat the allergic rhinoceroses with an approach similar to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/allergy-shots/about/pac-20392876" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;allergy shots in people&lt;/a&gt;, injecting them with small doses of the allergy-provoking substances and gradually dialling up the dose to teach their immune systems that they don't represent a threat and to lessen their response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l1qbp4.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l1qbp4.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l1qbp4.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l1qbp4.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l1qbp4.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l1qbp4.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l1qbp4.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l1qbp4.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l1qbp4.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l1qbp4.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Lincoln Park Zoo After treatment of allergy-provoking substances mixed into organic honey, Siku became much less reactive to these substances (Credit: Lincoln Park Zoo)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Lincoln Park Zoo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;After treatment of allergy-provoking substances mixed into organic honey, Siku became much less reactive to these substances (Credit: Lincoln Park Zoo)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Siku the polar bear received a similar treatment, receiving a combination of allergy-provoking substances mixed into organic honey – the licking of which helped the substances get absorbed through the soft tissues in his mouth. Honey has the added benefit of containing some local pollen itself, Gamble adds.

In a rat model, animals exposed to high alcohol levels performed significantly worse on a complex, shifting-reward task, even after nearly three months of sobriety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These decision-making deficits were linked to weakened neural activity in the dorsomedial striatum, a brain region crucial for evaluating choices. The findings suggest that alcohol-induced brain changes may underlie poor judgment and relapse in people with alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistent Damage:&lt;/strong&gt; Alcohol-exposed rats showed impaired decision-making months after withdrawal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted Brain Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Damage was found in the dorsomedial striatum, a decision-making hub.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex Differences Noted:&lt;/strong&gt; Effects were seen in male rats but not females, suggesting sex-based variability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;JHU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the first time researchers demonstrate in an animal how heavy alcohol use leads to long-term behavioral issues by damaging brain circuits critical for decision-making.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rats exposed to high amounts of alcohol exhibited poor decision-making during a complex task even after a monthslong withdrawal period.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, published today in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, provide a new explanation of alcohol’s long-term effects on cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now have a new model for the unfortunate cognitive changes that humans with alcohol use disorder show,” said author Patricia Janak, a Johns Hopkins University neuroscientist who studies the biology of addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that humans who are addicted to alcohol can show deficits in learning and decision-making that may contribute to their poor decisions related to alcohol use. We needed an animal model to better understand how chronic alcohol abuse affects the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Knowing what is happening in the brain of an animal when they are having these decision-making difficulties will tell us what is happening in humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments led by first author Yifeng Cheng, a research scientist in Janak’s lab who studies alcohol’s effects on the brain, rats recieved very high alcohol exposure for a month. Then after a withdrawal period of nearly three months, the rats were given a reward-based decision-making test along with a control group of rats that had not been exposed to alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get a reward, rats were given a choice of two levers. Pressing one lever led to a higher likelihood of reward than pressing the other lever. Rats easily learn which lever results in the most reward, so the researchers complicated things by every few minutes switching which lever had the highest reward likelihood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get the most reward, a rat should rapidly change its behavior every time it figures out that the reward likelihood has changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a difficult task that required memory and strategy. The alcohol-exposed rats performed considerably worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous experiments in animals weren’t comparable to humans with alcohol use disorder because the animals didn’t demonstrate deficits in rapid decision-making. The team believes this was because tasks in earlier experiments were too easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our experiment was quite challenging and the alcohol-exposed rats just couldn’t do it as well,” Janak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the right answer was constantly changing, the control rats made the best decisions faster. They were more strategic. And when we looked at their brains, the control rats’ decision-related neural signals were stronger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team linked the behavioral difficulties to dramatic functional transformations in the dorsomedial striatum, a part of the brain critical for decision-making. The alcohol had damaged neural circuits causing alcohol-exposed rats to process information less effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One surprise was how long alcohol dependence impairs cognition and neural function, even after withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This may give us insight into why relapse rates for people addicted to alcohol are so high,” Janak said. “Alcohol-induced neural deficits may contribute to decisions to drink even after going to rehab. We can clearly demonstrate these deficits can be long-lasting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team only found the behavioral and neural impairments only in male rats. The team does not believe this suggests female rats are immune from the effects of alcohol, but that there could be sex-related sensitivities in long-term alcohol effects on brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers next hope to explore how alcoholism affects other areas of the brain that interact with the dorsomedial striatum, and what might be causing the differences between males and females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional authors include Robin Magnard, a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins; Angela J. Langdon of the National Institutes of Health; and Daeyeol Lee, a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of Neuroscience and Psychological and Brain Sciences at Johns Hopkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AUD and cognition research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3a504855495f547a50524f145f5e4f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Jill Rosen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://jhu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JHU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Jill Rosen – JHU&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adt0200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chronic Ethanol Exposure Produces Sex-Dependent Impairments in Value Computations in the Striatum&lt;/a&gt;” by Patricia Janak et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic Ethanol Exposure Produces Sex-Dependent Impairments in Value Computations in the Striatum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Value-based decision-making relies on the striatum, where neural plasticity can be altered by chronic ethanol (EtOH) exposure, but the effects of such plasticity on striatal neural dynamics during decision-making remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study investigated the long-term impacts of EtOH on reward-driven decision-making and striatal neurocomputations in male and female rats using a dynamic probabilistic reversal learning task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a prolonged withdrawal period, EtOH-exposed male rats exhibited deficits in adaptability and exploratory behavior, with aberrant outcome-driven value updating that heightened preference for chosen action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These behavioral changes were linked to altered neural activity in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), where EtOH increased outcome-related encoding and decreased choice-related encoding. In contrast, female rats showed minimal behavioral changes with distinct EtOH-evoked alterations of neural activity, revealing significant sex differences in the impact of chronic EtOH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings underscore the impact of chronic EtOH exposure on adaptive decision-making, revealing enduring changes in neurocomputational processes in the striatum underlying cognitive deficits that differ by sex.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 22:10:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5rVW94c3Bva2FWdWItUE9SdkV2a082VGNnMEw5WUlpWi16QWl5R1hkcFhwcTBkNGtwa2c2dGgzUEd6cGhqY2ptZ1VWNlMyWGdMUjkxSmtfSUZqMUc3YmFxZXV4elhOdw</guid></item><item><title>Shingles is awful, but here’s another reason to get vaccinated: It may fight dementia - AP News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOMGprSnRzRmw5SFhPQWJmMnRhemRDUHozOXJQVk5GTWVaY1Z2RUpqeHd3T09QeU1IWF9kNzdQRmVJaXpZNDlNaHJmUk8xc2NrRUozRnZCYVZvSUI2TDRiTk1uRGpsZmNVa2tnNkF1d19wTW4yZjh0UXZZd0VIanZJcVRES29zTmhtRlhGeGlaOGpEcExCQWpiTnJIaVk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 21:18:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOMGprSnRzRmw5SFhPQWJmMnRhemRDUHozOXJQVk5GTWVaY1Z2RUpqeHd3T09QeU1IWF9kNzdQRmVJaXpZNDlNaHJmUk8xc2NrRUozRnZCYVZvSUI2TDRiTk1uRGpsZmNVa2tnNkF1d19wTW4yZjh0UXZZd0VIanZJcVRES29zTmhtRlhGeGlaOGpEcExCQWpiTnJIaVk</guid></item><item><title>Two infants die of whooping cough in Louisiana as cases climb nationally - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTFBjZHdrN2J1M3FnUk44ejZyNjJkOUJjT1hQQXhUQjNrLUNKNUNOR0RiZHVRUUdUWHhRVHRUcmotaVMtVFpQamdrN2pKbEtkNUllZE9BZHF2Wk82LVgxRTFibkd5SXUzLUZSeDNHTWdvN3RWYnozQ1djQ1FPOGY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In his 20 years working in pediatric infectious disease, Dr. John Schieffelin has never seen another illness like pertussis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Also known as whooping cough, it’s a contagious respiratory illness that can develop into a painful, full-body cough. The coughing fits can be severe, often accompanied by a whooping sound when the person tries to catch their breath. And it’s continuous, even if a person needs to be placed on a ventilator, says Schieffelin, an associate professor of pediatrics at Tulane University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“For infants, it’s really rather terrifying,” he said. “They’re just coughing so much, they can’t eat, they can’t drink, and they often get a pneumonia, which means we have to put them on a ventilator. … They just never stop coughing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In Louisiana, two infants have died of pertussis in the past six months, according to the state health department, the first deaths from the disease in the state since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Louisiana has had &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid033G3FFu4JL9XCG5WW2MtvhgRetMMV8Thf24HQnmsnA62GUKUgL6mA6Pfz2kqoUKD7l&amp;amp;id=61561728868838" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:110 cases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;110 cases&lt;/a&gt; of pertussis reported so far this year, the health department said – already approaching the 154 cases reported for all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cases are on the rise nationally, too.

Experts say they see peaks and valleys with these kinds of illnesses over the years, but there have been about 6,600 cases already in 2025, almost four times the number at this point last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“When you start to see these outbreaks … it tends to be as a result of that increased circulation of the microbe in the community, as well as populations with no immunity or reduced immunity that are susceptible to the infection,” said Dr. Lisa Morici, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Tulane University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Concerned about increasing cases, experts are urging vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The US had more than 200,000 cases of whooping cough every year before the vaccine was introduced. By &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/index.html#:~:text=Widespread%20use%20of%20the%20vaccine,with%20the%20pre%2Dvaccine%20era." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:1948;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;1948&lt;/a&gt;, the vaccine was widely used, and infection rates began to drop. They started to rise again in the 1980s, largely due to increased surveillance and some waning vaccine immunity, but fell during the Covid-19 pandemic, when spread of many infectious diseases slowed due to measures like masking and distancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Children are recommended to get a dose of the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis, or DTaP, vaccine at the ages of 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, between 15 to 18 months and again between 4 to 6 years, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diphtheria/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html#:~:text=CDC%20recommends%20routine%20DTaP%20vaccination,4%20through%206%20years" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Adolescents should get a booster with a version of the vaccine called Tdap between age 11 and 12, and adults are urged to get Tdap boosters every 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Infants too young to be vaccinated are susceptible to the bacteria, which is why officials &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/the-tdap-vaccine-and-pregnancy#:~:text=Tdap%20and%20Pregnancy%20Expand%20All&amp;amp;text=Should%20I%20get%20a%20Tdap,illness%20and%20complications%20of%20pertussis." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommend;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; that pregnant women get the vaccine in their third trimester, so the antibodies will be passed to the newborn.

The percentage of US kindergartners who received the DTaP vaccine has steadily declined over the past &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:five years;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;five years&lt;/a&gt;, leaving thousands vulnerable to infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Organizers within the state say that although many people have become hesitant about vaccinations, another issue is a lack of access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Especially in a state like Louisiana, we’ve got a lot of poverty. We’ve got a lot of rural populations, and not everyone has access to regular medical care,” said Dr. Jennifer Herricks, founder of Louisiana Families for Vaccines, a nonprofit that educates about vaccination. She says this is what makes state services and messaging even more important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pertussis cases in Louisiana are rising just weeks after the state Department of Health said it was ending vaccine promotion through events like health fairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The State of Louisiana and LDH have historically promoted vaccines for vaccine preventable illnesses through our parish health units, community health fairs, partnerships and media campaigns,” Surgeon General Dr. Ralph Abraham wrote in a memo. “While we encourage each patient to discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination with their provider, LDH will no longer promote mass vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The memo differentiated between seasonal vaccines, such as Covid and flu vaccines, usually given at the state’s mass vaccination clinics and routine childhood vaccines, which it called “an important part of providing immunity to our children.” But local officials still expressed concern about the message being sent to residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“When you cast aspersions or doubt about the safety and efficacy of one vaccine, I think it really has a ripple effect for all vaccines,” said Dr. Jennifer Avegno, director of the New Orleans Health Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Last week, Abraham shared vaccination guidelines on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0yr3aK6TffWii4BMu5AhyMFmNLKVLq1vF8y6RatijbcoFLHg42CDevGf7nMmFgiogl&amp;amp;id=61561728868838" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Facebook;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; while acknowledging the pertussis deaths and increasing cases in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I’ve been encouraged that our state Department of Health is putting out good messaging about pertussis, but I worry that it’s going to get sort of lost in the in the shuffle,” Avegno said. “It’s maybe too little, too late.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN’s Deidre McPhillips contributed to this report. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 20:55:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTFBjZHdrN2J1M3FnUk44ejZyNjJkOUJjT1hQQXhUQjNrLUNKNUNOR0RiZHVRUUdUWHhRVHRUcmotaVMtVFpQamdrN2pKbEtkNUllZE9BZHF2Wk82LVgxRTFibkd5SXUzLUZSeDNHTWdvN3RWYnozQ1djQ1FPOGY</guid></item><item><title>Two infants die of whooping cough in Louisiana as cases climb nationally - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQb2M1T1pDMkU4NElkcmJlYmd3NGVHNUJ6LUtOOTh3MFREbUI1a0lhUUJWMHotQVRaZHBJVUlKUmVOczFWZGpORnIta2FVaHFRbU1pbXIzX242d1M2QTRnbkZwcXlhZm14X1JFaU9zTlJpc3d2ejlqSXo5cVQxMWJKa25jS0hVaUpId05R0gGCAUFVX3lxTFAydGVvV1hxZUR2cDhZOGhJUnRiNmUtdzktR0RubkI1d3NvZDBDck9HOVMtMUluM2MzSjgxMHI3QjJfU21US3VLRXZRQkdEandXNk1uTkFlN3RDV1VyZmVkV0g1NFQ5cjZtc1doY1BORnFtUmxoczVyX3F6ZG9kMVpnYVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0zydj00033b6mm39fnp0e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Also known as whooping cough, it’s a contagious respiratory illness that can develop into a painful, full-body cough. The coughing fits can be severe, often accompanied by a whooping sound when the person tries to catch their breath. And it’s continuous, even if a person needs to be placed on a ventilator, says Schieffelin, an associate professor of pediatrics at Tulane University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m00023b5v425frkte@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For infants, it’s really rather terrifying,” he said. “They’re just coughing so much, they can’t eat, they can’t drink, and they often get a pneumonia, which means we have to put them on a ventilator. … They just never stop coughing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m00033b5vuigj3u9b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Louisiana, two infants have died of pertussis in the past six months, according to the state health department, the first deaths from the disease in the state since 2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m00063b5v5vbeblqg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Louisiana has had &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid033G3FFu4JL9XCG5WW2MtvhgRetMMV8Thf24HQnmsnA62GUKUgL6mA6Pfz2kqoUKD7l&amp;amp;id=61561728868838" target="_blank"&gt;110 cases&lt;/a&gt; of pertussis reported so far this year, the health department said – already approaching the 154 cases reported for all of 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m00073b5v0i8bzaag@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cases are on the rise nationally, too. There were more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/media/pdfs/2025/01/pertuss-surv-report-2024_PROVISIONAL-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;35,000&lt;/a&gt; cases of whooping cough last year in the US, the highest number in more than a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/pertussis-cases-by-year.html" target="_blank"&gt;decade&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/media/pdfs/2025/01/pertuss-surv-report-2024_PROVISIONAL-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;10 people died&lt;/a&gt; — six of them less than 1 year old. Experts say they see peaks and valleys with these kinds of illnesses over the years, but there have been about 6,600 cases already in 2025, almost four times the number at this point last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m00083b5v05m3i44z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you start to see these outbreaks … it tends to be as a result of that increased circulation of the microbe in the community, as well as populations with no immunity or reduced immunity that are susceptible to the infection,” said Dr. Lisa Morici, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Tulane University School of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m00053b5v0q61ievj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Concerned about increasing cases, experts are urging vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m000b3b5vxn61he1n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US had more than 200,000 cases of whooping cough every year before the vaccine was introduced. By &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/index.html#:~:text=Widespread%20use%20of%20the%20vaccine,with%20the%20pre%2Dvaccine%20era." target="_blank"&gt;1948&lt;/a&gt;, the vaccine was widely used, and infection rates began to drop. They started to rise again in the 1980s, largely due to increased surveillance and some waning vaccine immunity, but fell during the Covid-19 pandemic, when spread of many infectious diseases slowed due to measures like masking and distancing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m000d3b5vwygqup1p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children are recommended to get a dose of the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis, or DTaP, vaccine at the ages of 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, between 15 to 18 months and again between 4 to 6 years, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diphtheria/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html#:~:text=CDC%20recommends%20routine%20DTaP%20vaccination,4%20through%206%20years" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Adolescents should get a booster with a version of the vaccine called Tdap between age 11 and 12, and adults are urged to get Tdap boosters every 10 years.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8zsayg500063b6mepzx7bwf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Infants too young to be vaccinated are susceptible to the bacteria, which is why officials &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/the-tdap-vaccine-and-pregnancy#:~:text=Tdap%20and%20Pregnancy%20Expand%20All&amp;amp;text=Should%20I%20get%20a%20Tdap,illness%20and%20complications%20of%20pertussis." target="_blank"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; that pregnant women get the vaccine in their third trimester, so the antibodies will be passed to the newborn. This prevents &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/vaccinating-pregnant-patients.html#:~:text=Tdap%20can%20be%20safely%20administered%20at%20any%20point%20during%20pregnancy,during%20a%20community%20pertussis%20outbreak." target="_blank"&gt;78% of pertussis cases&lt;/a&gt; in young infants and is 91% effective against hospitalization, the CDC says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8zsc2dq00093b6m0jo46z2d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another strategy that can protect infants is “cocooning,” in which members of the child’s household all get vaccinated to ensure protection, Schieffelin said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m00093b5v71yg65kl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Boosters are recommended because protection from the vaccine can &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/health/whooping-cough-cases-surging-human-challenge/index.html"&gt;fade over time&lt;/a&gt;, which may be one reason for the ongoing outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m000a3b5v3kve5h7r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Declining vaccination rates are another reason. The percentage of US kindergartners who received the DTaP vaccine has steadily declined over the past &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;five years&lt;/a&gt;, leaving thousands vulnerable to infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8zryd8h00003b6mz5dukk9d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Organizers within the state say that although many people have become hesitant about vaccinations, another issue is a lack of access.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8zsakhc00033b6mrs2w41uo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Especially in a state like Louisiana, we’ve got a lot of poverty. We’ve got a lot of rural populations, and not everyone has access to regular medical care,” said Dr. Jennifer Herricks, founder of Louisiana Families for Vaccines, a nonprofit that educates about vaccination. She says this is what makes state services and messaging even more important.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m000g3b5vk75ibvqk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pertussis cases in Louisiana are rising just weeks after the state Department of Health said it was ending vaccine promotion through events like health fairs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m000h3b5v6zf1iorv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The State of Louisiana and LDH have historically promoted vaccines for vaccine preventable illnesses through our parish health units, community health fairs, partnerships and media campaigns,” Surgeon General Dr. Ralph Abraham wrote in a memo. “While we encourage each patient to discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination with their provider, LDH will no longer promote mass vaccination.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m000i3b5vb5noqmno@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The memo differentiated between seasonal vaccines, such as Covid and flu vaccines, usually given at the state’s mass vaccination clinics and routine childhood vaccines, which it called “an important part of providing immunity to our children.” But local officials still expressed concern about the message being sent to residents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m000j3b5vyb6e4mum@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you cast aspersions or doubt about the safety and efficacy of one vaccine, I think it really has a ripple effect for all vaccines,” said Dr. Jennifer Avegno, director of the New Orleans Health Department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m000k3b5v36jvqryx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last week, Abraham shared vaccination guidelines&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0yr3aK6TffWii4BMu5AhyMFmNLKVLq1vF8y6RatijbcoFLHg42CDevGf7nMmFgiogl&amp;amp;id=61561728868838" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; while acknowledging the pertussis deaths and increasing cases in the state.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m000l3b5v7ehlecto@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’ve been encouraged that our state Department of Health is putting out good messaging about pertussis, but I worry that it’s going to get sort of lost in the in the shuffle,” Avegno said. “It’s maybe too little, too late.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm902zk0200003b5vnzy55o1t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

                                        As the Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a href="https://www.newser.com/story/366512/vast-layoffs-begin-at-hhs.html"&gt;undergoes mass layoffs&lt;/a&gt;, Texas is feeling its own health-related consequences as a result of billions of dollars in federal funding cuts imposed by the Trump administration. One of those consequences: the shuttering of free measles vaccine clinics in one major county, right as the state is dealing with a &lt;a href="https://www.newser.com/story/365868/texas-measles-count-almost-as-high-as-us-total-for-2024.html"&gt;continuing measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt;. Per &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/texas-measles-outbreak-dallas-vaccines-hhs-funding-cuts-rcna199144"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;, dozens of these clinics, which administer free MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccines, have been forced to close their doors in Dallas County, and more than 20 epidemiologists, lab workers, and other staffers tasked with fighting the outbreak have been let go.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

                                        "I just had to tell our commissioners this morning that we've had to cancel over 50 different clinics in our community" over the course of the next year, Dr. Philip Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department, tells &lt;a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/health/dallas-county-cancels-50-community-vaccination-events-doge-cuts-cdc-fda-jobs/3805663/"&gt;NBC Dallas-Fort Worth&lt;/a&gt;. "We had contacted a lot of schools that had lower vaccination rates," he says. "They had contacted us to set up clinics to go to those schools. Well, that's some of what we're having to cancel."
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

                                        Some $11.4 billion that was slashed nationally was originally earmarked for community health centers during the pandemic—money those centers have since put toward non-COVID-related public health initiatives—but last week, the White House announced it would "no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a nonexistent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago."

The Texas Department of State Health Services says that most of the cases have emerged in people who aren't vaccinated, or whose vaccination status isn't clear. The majority of the cases involve children. According to the CDC's &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_10-measles-cases-in-2025"&gt;Friday update&lt;/a&gt;, there are nearly 500 measles cases that have been reported nationally across at least 19 states, though ABC notes this is likely an undercount due to reporting delays.

The authors compared outcomes among 231,899 people with a positive COVID-19 test and 605,014 with a negative COVID-19 test (test-negative control group) from Nov 1, 2021, to Dec 31, 2023. Patient records were examined for a battery of 65 different laboratory tests for infectious illnesses in the 30 days to 12 months following documented COVID-19 illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almost 50% higher rate of non-COVID respiratory infections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with the test-negative control group, participants with a positive COVID-19 test who were not admitted had significantly increased rates of outpatient diagnosis of bacterial, fungal, and viral infectious illnesses (risk ratio [RR], 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15 to 1.19), outpatient respiratory infections (RR, 1.46), and admission to hospital for infectious illnesses (RR, 1.41), including for sepsis and respiratory infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those data translate to increased risk of 17%, 46%, and 41%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, non-hospitalized COVID patients had higher rates in 32% of the 65 laboratory-based outcomes compared to those who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That rate jumped in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, who had higher rates of positive results in 71% of the examined laboratory tests, after accounting for multiple comparisons with the COVID-negative cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COVID may alter immune function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further analyze the association between COVID-19 and subsequent infections, the authors compared people admitted to the hospital for seasonal influenza (3,293) and those admitted for COVID-19 (12,450) in the VA database and found that COVID patients had higher rates of admission to hospital for infectious illnesses (RR, 1.24), admission to hospital for sepsis (RR 1.35), and in-hospital use of antimicrobials (RR, 1.23).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00074-X/fulltext"&gt;&lt;u&gt;In a commentary&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the study, Gabriel Chodick, PhD, MHA, from Tel Aviv University, said these findings are important because they show that, even among patients with only moderate infection, COVID-19 seems to alter the immune system and make patients more vulnerable to future illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings have important implications for understanding the potential impact of COVID-19 on long-term immune function and susceptibility to pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings have important implications for understanding the potential impact of COVID-19 on long-term immune function and susceptibility to pathogens," Chodick writes. "The evidence suggests effects extending beyond the acute phase of infection, affecting even mild cases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Specifically, Stage 3A invasive ductal carcinoma that spread from my right breast to the lymph nodes in my armpit. The news, initially delivered via notification through my hospital’s portal while I was watching an old episode of “Love Island UK,” hit me like a truck. I hit pause on a challenge involving whipped cream and a slip-n-slide to sob into my boyfriend’s chest. I’m only 40. I don’t want to die. I don’t want to be sick. I don’t want to lose the life I’ve been dreaming and working so hard to have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After I let out every fear in me, I locked in. Cancer became my job. I began to prepare for what was to come, scrolling Reddit for advice from people who had been through it. I got my teeth cleaned, eyebrows tattooed, chopped my waist-length hair into a cute, yet drastic pixie cut, researched financial support organizations to help cover costs, and bought everything I’d need for this weird new life. And I wanted to ensure that as many people with breasts in my communities and beyond could be on higher alert of their possibly traitorous tits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fifteen years ago, my dad died of kidney cancer. In just seven months, a leg pain his doctor ignored took his life. Since his diagnosis I’ve lived under a cloud of paranoia, going to the doctor for any ailment fearing my own diagnosis. And then, it actually happened. The thing that killed my dad wanted to take me too. What a greedy little asshole.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I went for my first mammogram and ultrasound last year at 39, where I was informed I have dense breasts ― breast tissue that is more glandular and fibrous than fatty. It wasn’t until I read &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/breast-cancer-mammograms-early-detection-screenings.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a piece by Dyan Neary" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67ed7a36e4b0b937ab8f57b3" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.thecut.com/article/breast-cancer-mammograms-early-detection-screenings.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;a piece by Dyan Neary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in The Cut that I fully understood how prevalent dense breasts are, the fact that it puts me at greater risk for breast cancer, and what I need to demand medically to ensure I don’t fall through the cracks and die. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As Neary explains, fatty tissue appears on a mammogram as dark gray or black. Cancer tissue, which shows up as white, would stand out against the darkness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, because dense breast tissue also shows up as white, a mass or other cancerous tissue could go undetected. This makes it necessary for those with dense breast tissue, particularly those with family history of breast cancer, to get mammograms, ultrasounds and MRIs performed more regularly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In further research, I learned Latinas like myself and Black women have some of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5916740/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="highest levels of breast density" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67ed7a36e4b0b937ab8f57b3" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5916740/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;highest levels of breast density&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, putting us at even greater risk for breast cancer. Again, no doctor had explained this to me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is how I ended up topless in my bathroom making an instructional video on my iPhone and whipping out my boobs for any person with breasts to cop a virtual feel. And if they were nearby, I invited them to come get a real time squeeze.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;svg class="quote-svg" viewbox="0 0 36 28" fill="none"&gt;&lt;path d="M21.5311 28H32.7273V15.352H26.6124C28.3349 6.89096 36 2.26791 36 2.26791L28.4211 0C28.4211 0 21.5311 6.80374 21.5311 17.5327V28ZM0 28H11.1962V15.352H5.08134C6.80383 6.89096 14.4689 2.26791 14.4689 2.26791L6.88995 0C6.88995 0 0 6.80374 0 17.5327V28Z" fill="#F9EFEF"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;Boobs can be lumpy mysteries.

I’ve flashed them on girls’ trips, dropped them on friends’ foreheads (consensually) in a move I coined “the titty drop,” and any other time they craved a cool breeze. I gave my treacherous boobs a good, fun-filled life. Now it was time they did something more than produce a laugh and perfect cleavage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was determined to help others one topless DM at a time.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the video and in person, I explained all my symptoms and signs that had me worried: a sharp pain in my breast that often felt like a hot needle poking in, tender achiness, acne-like rashes across my chest I’d never had before, skin on my breast that looked like an orange peel that when pinched was so thick my fingers were unable to meet (this would later be found to be inflammatory breast cancer), and eventually a very large lump. I pinched the thickened, leathery skin and pressed upon my tumor, describing its plum-like feel, and invited them to do the same on me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;"In further research, I learned Latinas like myself and Black women have some of the highest levels of breast density, putting us at even greater risk for breast cancer," Zaragoza says. "Again, no doctor had explained this to me."&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Photo courtesy of Alex Zaragoza"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Photo courtesy of Alex Zaragoza&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At a get-together, the hair salon, wherever, I offered my boobs. I’d lift my shirt and explain everything on my breasts, inviting their &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;curious hands to squeeze, pinch, and push around. I could sense their fascination and anxiety as they let out an occasional “whoa, that’s crazy,” shared their own fears, or confessed that they’ve been putting off their exams. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I figured if they can feel and see a breast with cancer that it could help them as they examine their own breasts. They can say, “I remember Alex’s boob had this. Let me call the doctor right now,” and that could possibly save their life. That meant something to me. So much of having cancer is scary and humbling, leaving you at your most vulnerable. But in taking this small bit of control, I could direct the cancer. I’m not completely at its mercy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One acquaintance asked me how to tell the difference between normal lumps or benign cysts and cancerous ones. It seemed like a question with such an obvious answer until I realized we are all navigating with fear, a lack of knowledge, and with hope that maybe that thing we perhaps do feel is nothing. It’s all very scary, and remaining in the dark offers comfort. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But I had to tell her we’re not doctors; we’re regular people. Boobs can be lumpy mysteries. We just have to pay attention to our bodies, go to the doctors we trust, who can examine us and give us answers. And, most importantly, we have to advocate for ourselves like our lives depend on it, because they do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The hospital where I was initially getting my mammogram and ultrasound failed to schedule me at the six-month mark after my first exams showed the presence of calcification in my right breast. They couldn’t fit me in until three months after, at the nine-month mark. And when my ultrasound came back abnormal in January of this year, their scheduler said they had no appointments for my MRI and biopsy until late March. I moved all my testing to City of Hope ― the No. 5 cancer hospital in the U.S. whose main campus is, blessedly, 20 minutes from my house.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My boyfriend and I drove an hour-and-a-half multiple times to one of their newer facilities to ensure I could get further tests performed as soon as possible. From there, my treatment has been swift and aggressive. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On March 7, I did my first round of chemo, eight days after official diagnosis. My surgeon informed me I was her second patient who had been seen at the other hospital who, because of testing performed later than medically required, discovered their cancer was more advanced than it would have been had we been tested at the six-month mark.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I think about what that could’ve meant for me as I lose my hair in thick chunks and get such bad diarrhea that I bleed, and pass blood clots that land me in the ER. As I slather myself thick with special creams to avoid my skin getting chemo burn or feeling like sandpaper. As I discover that a nasty UTI is actually the chemo giving me early menopause. As my tongue begins to feel like a fat, dried out sponge and everything tastes bitter. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But then it passes as I get further away from my infusion and I start feeling almost…normal. Then the next round comes and it’s back to square one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I also think about those of us who, compelled by politeness or the brick wall that the health system can be, accept that later appointment time. I think about people who may struggle with language barriers and people with bad insurance or no insurance or the ability to research their very best options. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I think about people who don’t have access to a top tier cancer center. People who have so many responsibilities that their health isn’t even a top 10 priority. People who are undocumented and being targeted by this administration. People struggling financially and people who are without a support system that can help them navigate this stressful disease. And I thought about people overwhelmed by the tidal wave of emotion and information that begins to flood you the second the doctor says, “Unfortunately, I have bad news.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even with the cancer of it all, I realize how fortunate I am. I’m humbled every day. My doctors are confident I’m going to beat the cancer. The next two years are going to suck, sure, but this thing already wants me dead. I’m not going to let it kill my stupid, silly spirit. Since sending out my boob videos, I’ve gotten tons of DMs from friends and strangers that they set their mammogram and ultrasound appointments. One person had put it off for 10 years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

Specifically, Stage 3A invasive ductal carcinoma that spread from my right breast to the lymph nodes in my armpit. The news, initially delivered via notification through my hospital’s portal while I was watching an old episode of “Love Island UK,” hit me like a truck. I hit pause on a challenge involving whipped cream and a slip-n-slide to sob into my boyfriend’s chest. I’m only 40. I don’t want to die. I don’t want to be sick. I don’t want to lose the life I’ve been dreaming and working so hard to have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After I let out every fear in me, I locked in. Cancer became my job. I began to prepare for what was to come, scrolling Reddit for advice from people who had been through it. I got my teeth cleaned, eyebrows tattooed, chopped my waist-length hair into a cute, yet drastic pixie cut, researched financial support organizations to help cover costs, and bought everything I’d need for this weird new life. And I wanted to ensure that as many people with breasts in my communities and beyond could be on higher alert of their possibly traitorous tits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fifteen years ago, my dad died of kidney cancer. In just seven months, a leg pain his doctor ignored took his life. Since his diagnosis I’ve lived under a cloud of paranoia, going to the doctor for any ailment fearing my own diagnosis. And then, it actually happened. The thing that killed my dad wanted to take me too. What a greedy little asshole.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I went for my first mammogram and ultrasound last year at 39, where I was informed I have dense breasts ― breast tissue that is more glandular and fibrous than fatty. It wasn’t until I read &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/breast-cancer-mammograms-early-detection-screenings.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a piece by Dyan Neary" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67ed7a36e4b0b937ab8f57b3" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.thecut.com/article/breast-cancer-mammograms-early-detection-screenings.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;a piece by Dyan Neary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in The Cut that I fully understood how prevalent dense breasts are, the fact that it puts me at greater risk for breast cancer, and what I need to demand medically to ensure I don’t fall through the cracks and die. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As Neary explains, fatty tissue appears on a mammogram as dark gray or black. Cancer tissue, which shows up as white, would stand out against the darkness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, because dense breast tissue also shows up as white, a mass or other cancerous tissue could go undetected. This makes it necessary for those with dense breast tissue, particularly those with family history of breast cancer, to get mammograms, ultrasounds and MRIs performed more regularly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In further research, I learned Latinas like myself and Black women have some of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5916740/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="highest levels of breast density" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67ed7a36e4b0b937ab8f57b3" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5916740/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;highest levels of breast density&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, putting us at even greater risk for breast cancer. Again, no doctor had explained this to me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is how I ended up topless in my bathroom making an instructional video on my iPhone and whipping out my boobs for any person with breasts to cop a virtual feel. And if they were nearby, I invited them to come get a real time squeeze.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;svg class="quote-svg" viewbox="0 0 36 28" fill="none"&gt;&lt;path d="M21.5311 28H32.7273V15.352H26.6124C28.3349 6.89096 36 2.26791 36 2.26791L28.4211 0C28.4211 0 21.5311 6.80374 21.5311 17.5327V28ZM0 28H11.1962V15.352H5.08134C6.80383 6.89096 14.4689 2.26791 14.4689 2.26791L6.88995 0C6.88995 0 0 6.80374 0 17.5327V28Z" fill="#F9EFEF"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;Boobs can be lumpy mysteries.

I’ve flashed them on girls’ trips, dropped them on friends’ foreheads (consensually) in a move I coined “the titty drop,” and any other time they craved a cool breeze. I gave my treacherous boobs a good, fun-filled life. Now it was time they did something more than produce a laugh and perfect cleavage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was determined to help others one topless DM at a time.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the video and in person, I explained all my symptoms and signs that had me worried: a sharp pain in my breast that often felt like a hot needle poking in, tender achiness, acne-like rashes across my chest I’d never had before, skin on my breast that looked like an orange peel that when pinched was so thick my fingers were unable to meet (this would later be found to be inflammatory breast cancer), and eventually a very large lump. I pinched the thickened, leathery skin and pressed upon my tumor, describing its plum-like feel, and invited them to do the same on me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;"In further research, I learned Latinas like myself and Black women have some of the highest levels of breast density, putting us at even greater risk for breast cancer," Zaragoza says. "Again, no doctor had explained this to me."&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Photo courtesy of Alex Zaragoza"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Photo courtesy of Alex Zaragoza&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At a get-together, the hair salon, wherever, I offered my boobs. I’d lift my shirt and explain everything on my breasts, inviting their &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;curious hands to squeeze, pinch, and push around. I could sense their fascination and anxiety as they let out an occasional “whoa, that’s crazy,” shared their own fears, or confessed that they’ve been putting off their exams. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I figured if they can feel and see a breast with cancer that it could help them as they examine their own breasts. They can say, “I remember Alex’s boob had this. Let me call the doctor right now,” and that could possibly save their life. That meant something to me. So much of having cancer is scary and humbling, leaving you at your most vulnerable. But in taking this small bit of control, I could direct the cancer. I’m not completely at its mercy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One acquaintance asked me how to tell the difference between normal lumps or benign cysts and cancerous ones. It seemed like a question with such an obvious answer until I realized we are all navigating with fear, a lack of knowledge, and with hope that maybe that thing we perhaps do feel is nothing. It’s all very scary, and remaining in the dark offers comfort. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But I had to tell her we’re not doctors; we’re regular people. Boobs can be lumpy mysteries. We just have to pay attention to our bodies, go to the doctors we trust, who can examine us and give us answers. And, most importantly, we have to advocate for ourselves like our lives depend on it, because they do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The hospital where I was initially getting my mammogram and ultrasound failed to schedule me at the six-month mark after my first exams showed the presence of calcification in my right breast. They couldn’t fit me in until three months after, at the nine-month mark. And when my ultrasound came back abnormal in January of this year, their scheduler said they had no appointments for my MRI and biopsy until late March. I moved all my testing to City of Hope ― the No. 5 cancer hospital in the U.S. whose main campus is, blessedly, 20 minutes from my house.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My boyfriend and I drove an hour-and-a-half multiple times to one of their newer facilities to ensure I could get further tests performed as soon as possible. From there, my treatment has been swift and aggressive. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On March 7, I did my first round of chemo, eight days after official diagnosis. My surgeon informed me I was her second patient who had been seen at the other hospital who, because of testing performed later than medically required, discovered their cancer was more advanced than it would have been had we been tested at the six-month mark.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I think about what that could’ve meant for me as I lose my hair in thick chunks and get such bad diarrhea that I bleed, and pass blood clots that land me in the ER. As I slather myself thick with special creams to avoid my skin getting chemo burn or feeling like sandpaper. As I discover that a nasty UTI is actually the chemo giving me early menopause. As my tongue begins to feel like a fat, dried out sponge and everything tastes bitter. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But then it passes as I get further away from my infusion and I start feeling almost…normal. Then the next round comes and it’s back to square one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I also think about those of us who, compelled by politeness or the brick wall that the health system can be, accept that later appointment time. I think about people who may struggle with language barriers and people with bad insurance or no insurance or the ability to research their very best options. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I think about people who don’t have access to a top tier cancer center. People who have so many responsibilities that their health isn’t even a top 10 priority. People who are undocumented and being targeted by this administration. People struggling financially and people who are without a support system that can help them navigate this stressful disease. And I thought about people overwhelmed by the tidal wave of emotion and information that begins to flood you the second the doctor says, “Unfortunately, I have bad news.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even with the cancer of it all, I realize how fortunate I am. I’m humbled every day. My doctors are confident I’m going to beat the cancer. The next two years are going to suck, sure, but this thing already wants me dead. I’m not going to let it kill my stupid, silly spirit. Since sending out my boob videos, I’ve gotten tons of DMs from friends and strangers that they set their mammogram and ultrasound appointments. One person had put it off for 10 years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

                    &lt;p&gt;The measles outbreak that started in Texas in late January continues to grow. As of March 27, 2025, confirmed cases across the United States reached 483, surpassing the total number of confirmed cases recorded in 2024. About 93 percent of the cases are associated with the outbreak, &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/texas/2025/03/18/texas-measles-outbreak-grows-spreads-across-3-states-as-case-numbers-swell/"&gt;which now spans Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/whats-behind-the-growing-measles-outbreak-and-how-the-trump-administration-is-responding"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; What’s behind the growing measles outbreak and how the Trump administration is responding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/texas-measles-outbreak-grows-us-surpasses-case-count-2024"&gt;The vast majority of cases&lt;/a&gt; are in people who are not vaccinated. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/providers/public-health-officials-say-cdc-cuts-misinformation-top-down-hinders-measles-response"&gt;a lack of clarity from health authorities&lt;/a&gt; is leaving people with questions about whether they need to get revaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Q&amp;amp;A with The Conversation U.S., &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vbYSl7sAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Daniel Pastula&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist and medical epidemiologist from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and Colorado School of Public Health, explained how and when you should take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Should adults get another shot of the measles vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine, which first &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lpm.2022.104149"&gt;became available in the U.S. in 1963&lt;/a&gt;, contains a live but significantly weakened strain of the measles virus. This modified strain is too weak to cause measles, but it is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2017.0143"&gt;similar enough to the wild type measles virus&lt;/a&gt; to train the immune system to recognize it. Most people who have received the live measles vaccine won’t need an additional shot now, but here is what you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People born before 1957 are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html#cdc_generic_section_2-presumptive-evidence-of-immunity"&gt;presumed to have lifelong immunity&lt;/a&gt; because measles was so contagious that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;almost everyone contracted it before age 15&lt;/a&gt;. Unless there are special circumstances, they probably don’t need a vaccine now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people born after 1957 would have received the shot as children, so they should be set for life. Physicians and public health experts &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html#immunity"&gt;don’t recommend most people in this group get a second measles shot&lt;/a&gt;, though there are exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1989, a limited outbreak of measles &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.me.43.020192.002315"&gt;occurred among vaccinated school children&lt;/a&gt;. In response, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;recommendations changed from one dose&lt;/a&gt; of the live measles vaccine to two doses for children. People fully vaccinated as children after that year &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html#immunity"&gt;do not need any additional doses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_514718" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-514718" class="wp-image-514718 size-full" src="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-5.jpg" alt="When should kids get vaccinated? The CDC recommends: MMR - First dose: 12-15 months old, second dose: 4-6 years old. MMRV - First dose: 12-15 months old, second dose: 4-6 years old (but can also be given 3 months after first dose)" srcset="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-5.jpg 1080w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-5-240x300.jpg 240w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-5-768x960.jpg 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-5-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-5-425x531.jpg 425w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-514718" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Graphic by Steff Staples/PBS News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exceptions to these guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two special circumstances where the previous recommendations may not hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, if you were vaccinated between 1963 and 1967, one of the measles vaccines available at the time consisted of just proteins from the virus rather than a live, weakened version of it. Researchers soon realized this &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2012.301075"&gt;inactivated, or “killed,” vaccine was less effective&lt;/a&gt; and didn’t provide long-term immunity. Unless you know for certain you received the live vaccine, physicians and public health experts recommend that people vaccinated during those years &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html#immunity"&gt;get one dose of the live vaccine&lt;/a&gt; at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, if you fall into a high-risk group – for example, if you are a health care provider, are traveling internationally or attending college, physicians and public health experts generally &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html#immunity"&gt;recommend getting a second dose&lt;/a&gt; if you have only had one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_514668" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-514668" class="wp-image-514668 size-full" src="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-7.jpg" alt='Who should consider getting a booster? The CDC says most people who receive two doses of a measles vaccine following the U.S. vaccination schedule are "protected for life." You might need a booster if you received a measles vaccine before 1968, as that shot was not as effective as the current ones. Talk to your health care provider about what is best for you.' srcset="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-7.jpg 1080w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-7-240x300.jpg 240w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-7-768x960.jpg 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-7-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-7-425x531.jpg 425w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-514668" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Graphic by Steff Staples/PBS News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most adults without such risk factors, physicians and public health experts &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html#immunity"&gt;do not routinely recommend a second dose&lt;/a&gt; if you have previously received one dose of a live measles vaccine. If you have questions or concerns about your situation, make sure to ask your health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except in very rare circumstances, there is no recommendation for a third dose of the measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can you find out whether you’ve been vaccinated?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be able to! It’s worth checking. &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/official-guidance/state-policies/state-websites/"&gt;States actually keep vaccine records&lt;/a&gt; specifically for this reason, where you can look up your vaccine records or that of your kids. Your high school or college may still have your records, and so might your pediatrician’s office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Should you get your antibody levels checked?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most people, probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A titer test &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/antibody-titer"&gt;checks the level of antibodies in your blood&lt;/a&gt;, and some people are asking their doctor to check their titers to determine whether they are still immune to measles. The problem is, the level of antibodies in your blood does not necessarily reflect your level of immunity. That’s because antibodies are &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279364/"&gt;just one part of your immune system’s infection-fighting force&lt;/a&gt;. Having a low level of antibodies does not necessarily mean your immunity has waned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other crucial elements of your immune response include &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/t-cells--b-cells-and-the-immune-system.h00-159465579.html"&gt;B cells, T cells and other immune cells&lt;/a&gt;, but a titer test does not show their capabilities. For example, memory B cells might not currently be making antibodies against the virus but are primed to quickly do so the next time they see it. This is why antibody and titer tests should be used only in specific cases, in consultation with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_514671" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-514671" class="wp-image-514671 size-full" src="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-8.jpg" alt="Is there a test to check your immunity to measles? The CDC recommends locating your vaccination records to see if you have received either the MMR or MMRV vaccine. You can also ask a health care provider to administer a blood test to determine if you are immune." srcset="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-8.jpg 1080w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-8-240x300.jpg 240w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-8-768x960.jpg 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-8-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-8-425x531.jpg 425w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-514671" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Graphic by Steff Staples/PBS News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of when an antibody test may be warranted is if you are a health care provider born before 1957 and you want to make sure you don’t need another dose of the vaccine. You would use a test to see whether you have measles antibodies. But in this case you would be looking for a yes or no answer; the total amount of antibodies may not be very informative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is natural immunity better than vaccine-induced immunity?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural immunity – that is, the immunity you get after having measles – is effective. However, the downside is that natural infection with a wild virus is very risky. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;Before 1963, measles caused&lt;/a&gt; close to 50,000 hospitalizations and about 500 deaths each year in the United States, usually in children. It also caused over 1,000 cases of severe brain inflammation every year and carried several other long-term risks, such as permanent hearing loss or the wipe out of immunity to other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/what-to-know-about-highly-contagious-measles-and-how-to-protect-yourself"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; What to know about highly contagious measles and how to protect yourself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of vaccines is to create immunity without the risks of severe infection. It is basically a dress rehearsal for the real thing. The immunity from a vaccine is effectively the same immunity you get from having measles itself – but vastly safer than encountering the wild virus unprotected. One dose is 93 percent effective at preventing measles and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html"&gt;two doses are 97 percent effective&lt;/a&gt;, and any breakthrough cases are likely to be much milder than a full-blown case of measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can the vaccine cause measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, the measles vaccine cannot cause measles because it contains a significantly weakened strain that has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2017.0143"&gt;limited ability to infect and damage cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have claimed without evidence that the current &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/texas-measles-outbreak-anti-vaccine-advocates-blame-shot-rcna193478"&gt;outbreak in Texas was caused by the measles vaccine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/measles-cases-are-rising-in-the-u-s-heres-why-misinformation-about-the-vaccine-persists-today"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Measles cases are rising in the U.S. Here’s why misinformation about the vaccine persists today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the outbreak investigation, however, CDC and the Texas Department of State Health Services analyzed the genome of the virus causing the current outbreak and identified it as a wild measles virus. Researchers classify measles virus strains &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/php/laboratories/genetic-analysis.html"&gt;based on their genetic characteristics, or genotypes&lt;/a&gt;. They identified &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/person-dies-measles-west-texas-outbreak-rcna193812"&gt;the outbreak virus as wild type genotype D8&lt;/a&gt;, and not the weakened measles vaccine strain, which is genotype A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gZx28D6I8aI?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Measles vaccination has worked so well that many people today have never seen a measles case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the risks of the vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a very reasonable question. Because the measles vaccine is a live, weakened virus strain, it can cause a mild, measles-like syndrome. For example, some people might have a slight fever, a rash, or some slight joint pain. These symptoms generally go away in a day or two, and most people don’t experience them. But the vaccine cannot cause measles itself, as it does not contain the wild measles virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In extremely rare cases, people can experience &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6204a1.htm"&gt;more significant reactions to the measles vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. It is important to remember that every single medical or health intervention carries risks – and that includes all medications and over-the-counter supplements. According to all available evidence, however, comparing the potential benefits against potential risks reveals that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/opinion/vaccine-hesitancy.html"&gt;the risks of a signficant reaction&lt;/a&gt; to the vaccine are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004407.pub4"&gt;much lower than the risks of severe outcomes from measles&lt;/a&gt; itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being vaccinated not only protects you and your family, but it also &lt;a href="https://vaccineknowledge.ox.ac.uk/herd-immunity#How-does-herd-immunity-work"&gt;protects vulnerable people in the community&lt;/a&gt;, such as infants, cancer patients and pregnant women, who cannot be vaccinated themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

Those smoking fentanyl, however, have been able to get them for free, at taxpayers’ expense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;There was also the time five years ago, when the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.ktvu.com/news/san-francisco-supervisor-drug-overdose-billboard-sends-wrong-message" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;city helped pay for a billboard&lt;/a&gt; that showed smiling, glittery partygoers. “Do it with friends,” the public service message said, urging drug users to consume with others so they could treat a potential overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;For decades, San Francisco has been a liberal city where those using drugs found easy access to their substance of choice and a government generally willing to tolerate addiction. City leaders emphasized a harm reduction approach, believing that more lives would be saved by helping users to consume safely than by punishing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/us/daniel-lurie-san-francisco-mayor.html?searchResultPosition=1" title=""&gt;Daniel Lurie&lt;/a&gt;, the moderate Democrat who became the city’s new mayor in January, said this week that things had gone too far. He told The New York Times that he would announce on Wednesday a new policy that walks back the free distribution of clean foil, pipes and plastic straws on the streets of San Francisco.

South Bank University, recently shared the simple things you can change in your lifestyle to prevent a stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is disrupted or blocked or when a blood vessel bursts. This restricts the blood and oxygen vital to keep the brain healthy and the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14037607/warning-life-threatening-signs-stroke-easily-missed.html"&gt;damage may become permanent&lt;/a&gt; if enough brain cells die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Strokes are the second leading cause of death worldwide and the fifth most common in the US. Nearly 800,000 Americans experience a stroke every year, out of which at least 140,000 people die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stroke risk factors that tend to be more common among older people – such as high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol, obesity, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-e2a15870-0fd9-11f0-b9d3-bf1bca50bcae"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, smoking, physical inactivity and poor diet – are now increasingly found in younger people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Mclernon wrote in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/eight-ways-to-reduce-your-stroke-risk-no-matter-what-age-you-are-251524"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;: 'Adopting these simple lifestyle changes can help to reduce stroke risk and optimize both heart and brain health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Below, DailyMail.com details the common lifestyle changes Mclernon suggests to prevent a brain stroke:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to Stroke association, having high levels of 'bad' cholesterol can increase the risk of stroke by 10 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Avoid smoking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Mclernon, the most important thing to do to improve brain health is to quit smoking cigarettes and vapes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Apart from accelerating brain aging and increasing the risk for dementia, smoking causes damage to blood vessel walls in the brain and reduces overall oxygen levels due to the carbon monoxide in tobacco  - making the body more prone to having a stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also causes blood to become sticky, further increasing the risk of blood clots that can block blood vessels and cause a stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who smoke 20 cigarettes every day are six times more likely to have a stroke than people who do not smoke, according to Medical News Today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Maintain blood pressure and stabilize cholesterol &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Siobhan Mclernon, a former neurocritical care nurse has revealed the five things you can do to take care of your brain health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High blood pressure can put stress on artery walls, which can make them weaker and lead to the accumulation of fat molecules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can cause extensive damage in the vessels and pave the way for blood clots to form or break [BREAK WHAT?] them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2020 JAMA &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2770254"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that having blood pressure 10-mm Hg higher than a healthy range can increase the risk of strokes caused by blood clots by 20 percent and strokes caused by the bursting of a blood vessel by 31 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The nurse wrote in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/eight-ways-to-reduce-your-stroke-risk-no-matter-what-age-you-are-251524"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;: 'If you're over 18 years of age, get your blood pressure checked regularly so, if you do show signs of developing high blood pressure, you can nip it in the bud and make appropriate changes to your lifestyle to help reduce your risk of stroke.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, studies show high levels of LDL ('bad') cholesterol and triglycerides (blood fats) raise the risk of strokes caused by blood clots due to the build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Stroke Association, having high levels of 'bad' cholesterol can increase the risk of stroke by 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to Mclernon, the most important thing to do to improve brain health is to quit smoking cigarettes and vapes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Reduce blood sugar levels &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another key aspect to pay attention to is blood sugar levels in the body, Mclernon suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High blood sugar (hyperglycemia) is a significant risk factor for stroke as it can damage blood vessels, which can lead to blood clots that travel to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, excessive blood glucose can result in increased fatty deposits or clots in blood vessels. These clots can narrow or block blood vessels in the brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The lecturer noted: 'To reduce blood glucose levels, try to take regular exercise, eat a balanced diet rich in fiber, drink enough water, maintain a healthy weight, and try to manage stress.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People suffering from diabetes are two times more at risk of having a stroke than their healthy counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Maintain a healthy weight and diet &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Being overweight and eating unbalanced meals can significantly amplify risks for having a stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Carrying too much weight increases your risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, high cholesterol and Type 2 diabetes - all of which can damage blood cells, impact oxygen levels and contribute to higher stroke risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with a BMI of 25 or more are classified as overweight, while those with a BMI of 30 or more are defined as obese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mclernon says that following a Mediterranean diet can help maintain health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the World Stroke organization, being overweight increases your risk of stroke by 22 percent and if you are obese, that risk increases by 64 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Mclernon says following a Mediterranean diet - a diet that emphasizes plant-based foods and healthy fats including vegetables, fruit, beans, lentils, whole grains, fish, extra virgin olive oil and nuts - can help maintain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'One way to eat a fiber-rich balanced diet and maintain a healthy weight is to follow a Mediterranean diet. This has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke, especially when supplemented with nuts and olive oil.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Exercise and sleep are essential&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lastly, the adult nurse and senior lecturer advised to get seven to nine hours of sleep every night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While not a direct cause, poor sleep and sleep disorders, especially sleep apnea, are linked to an increased risk of stroke, potentially due to inflammation, reduced oxygen levels and blood flow to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk of stroke symptoms is four times greater among individuals who slept fewer than six hours a night compared to individuals who reported seven to eight hours of sleep a night, according to researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who analyzed data on 5,666 individuals for three years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Mclernon also warns against excessive sleeping and says: 'Too much sleep, however, is also associated with increased stroke risk, so try to stay as active as possible so you can sleep as well as possible.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also recommends people to exercise more than two days per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC recommends US adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity each week, plus muscle-strengthening exercises at least two days a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Exercise should be spread evenly over four to five days a week, or every day. Do strengthening activities, usually more than two days per week,' the nurse noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Her death marks the state's first documented human fatality from bird flu and the second in India — after a case in Haryana in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girl was admitted to AIIMS-Mangalagiri with symptoms of bird flu on March 4 and died on March 16. The case came to light on Wednesday after officials reconfirmed her swab test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune and Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL) in Guntur identified the presence of H5N1 in her samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;How informed do you feel about the risks of bird flu?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state govt declared a state of high alert, directing all district medical and health officers to conduct fever screenings in vulnerable areas. "We are also looking for people with unusual symptoms," said principal secretary (health) MT Krishna Babu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, officials assured the public there was no cause for alarm, saying the death was linked to having raw chicken rather than human-to-human transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girl's parents said they had fed her a small piece of raw chicken on Feb 28, something they had done on previous occasions without issue. However, this time she developed severe health complications, including breathlessness and diarrhoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child's father works as a loan recovery agent at a private bank, while her mother is a homemaker. The parents first took the girl to a local hospital before transferring her to AIIMS as her condition worsened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mgid_country_osv_parent"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors collected nasal swab samples on March 7, confirming influenza A at the hospital's VRDL. Further testing at Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) lab in New Delhi identified the H5N1 virus, with NIV Pune reconfirming the results before the girl's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other family members who ate the cooked chicken remain healthy. Health officials collected nasal swab samples from the family and others who had purchased chicken from the same meat shop. All initial tests came back negative. "We have once again collected nasal swab samples from the family members and sent them to VRDL for analysis," a senior health official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal husbandry director Dr T Damodar Naidu advised people to eat chicken and eggs only after cooking them thoroughly, "as the bird flu virus cannot survive at temperatures above 60 to 70 degrees Celsius".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials ruled out further spread, saying H5N1 has a short incubation period of three to four days. "As the girl died 18 days ago and no additional cases have been detected, there is no possibility of transmission," a health official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIIMS-Mangalagiri described it as a "sporadic case" rather than an outbreak and doctors said no new human infections had been reported since March 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case has sparked concern across the state, particularly after the animal husbandry department recently declared Andhra Pradesh free from bird flu, citing no recorded mortality in commercial poultry farms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Following the child's death, we conducted physical surveillance at all poultry farms and backyard poultry in Guntur, Palnadu, Prakasam district, and Narasaraopet town. No traces of bird flu were found in poultry," said animal husbandry director Naidu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 19:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Child with measles confirmed in Snohomish County, 2 clinics exposed - KOMO</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgJBVV95cUxOclI0NUhVU2oxLTJ3c0dqZnlTTXFQRkphV2hLTXlDNXB0RWZqa0RST1FwQnc1eTFIcWFFcXNYQ3VMWXNKNW5IME1hdDltWEZjakhkdnpmMy1uRFFBX0xLMHYwRy1CY2IwYlIxQWNselRMVzdRejB5YlNJUktqSk9XTDRvSi1yT3FkRlJaYUsyVFNPcTZxYW5mQnhTYk83QWE1Xzl5Q3BUNTJwRTFueHNhQy1BU2djV0s5OTV4WW1MaUFWcHB0Mjl1TWxOLThqaDBpRGFOa3JmZlFUUXB5c0JCUDRkWmdmenJ5Z2VlelVrNHlQMDN6dUJhRGZyREFQZ1U4dzJvSEZUU0ItMkxzc2JrdzBocEJ5dlFjMndlQ09ISWxZVl9fVkliOE1kblBSdS1NdWoxVUhnbHYxVDYzT0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;SNOHOMISH COUNTY, Wash. — &lt;/span&gt;Providence Medical Group Northwest has confirmed that a pediatric patient with measles visited two of its clinics in Snohomish County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child was seen at the PMG Monroe Walk-in Clinic on Saturday, March 29, and again at the PMG Mill Creek Walk-in Clinic on Monday, March 31. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED | &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/measles-case-in-washington-raises-outbreak-fears-amid-declining-vaccination-rates-vaxx-immunity-herd-children-baby-toddler-sick-doctor-hospital-pediatrician-outbreak-pandemic-vitamin-a-cough-sneeze-fever-rash" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/local/measles-case-in-washington-raises-outbreak-fears-amid-declining-vaccination-rates-vaxx-immunity-herd-children-baby-toddler-sick-doctor-hospital-pediatrician-outbreak-pandemic-vitamin-a-cough-sneeze-fever-rash" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Measles case in Washington raises outbreak fears as vaccination rates decline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child and their family were later sent to Seattle Children’s for further testing, which confirmed the measles diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"During both clinic visits, PMG staff followed thorough screening measures for the symptoms present and followed measles precautions and protocols to ensure the health and safety of our patients, their family members and our caregivers," said Providence Medical Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Providence Swedish urges anyone who visited these clinics during these exposure periods to seek medical advice and monitor for symptoms for 14 days following possible exposure:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PMG Monroe Walk-in Clinic – Saturday, March 29, from 6:25 –10 p.m. Exposed individuals should monitor for symptoms April 5-19.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PMG Mill Creek Walk-in Clinic – Monday, March 31, from 8:55 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. Exposed individuals should monitor for symptoms April 7-21.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Measles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious and potentially severe disease, causing fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. If one person contracts measles, up to nine out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. The disease mainly spreads through the air after a person with measles coughs or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People infected with measles are contagious four days before the rash starts through four days after the rash appears. The incubation period for measles from exposure to fever is usually about seven to 10 days, and from exposure to rash onset is usually about 10-14 days (with a range of seven to 21 days.) People can spread measles before they have the characteristic measles rash. Measles can lead to ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia, and in rare cases, encephalitis (brain inflammation) or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy people can experience complications from measles, but those at highest risk include infants and children under five years, adults over 20 years, pregnant people, and those with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccination offers safe, effective measles protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent measles, Providence Swedish strongly recommends everyone receive the safe and highly effective MMR vaccine. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles and providing long-lasting protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information can be found on the Snohomish County Health Department's &lt;a href="https://www.snohd.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=841" target="_blank" title="https://www.snohd.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=841" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;WEBSITE. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 19:02:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgJBVV95cUxOclI0NUhVU2oxLTJ3c0dqZnlTTXFQRkphV2hLTXlDNXB0RWZqa0RST1FwQnc1eTFIcWFFcXNYQ3VMWXNKNW5IME1hdDltWEZjakhkdnpmMy1uRFFBX0xLMHYwRy1CY2IwYlIxQWNselRMVzdRejB5YlNJUktqSk9XTDRvSi1yT3FkRlJaYUsyVFNPcTZxYW5mQnhTYk83QWE1Xzl5Q3BUNTJwRTFueHNhQy1BU2djV0s5OTV4WW1MaUFWcHB0Mjl1TWxOLThqaDBpRGFOa3JmZlFUUXB5c0JCUDRkWmdmenJ5Z2VlelVrNHlQMDN6dUJhRGZyREFQZ1U4dzJvSEZUU0ItMkxzc2JrdzBocEJ5dlFjMndlQ09ISWxZVl9fVkliOE1kblBSdS1NdWoxVUhnbHYxVDYzT0E</guid></item><item><title>Chart shows how measles is spreading exponentially in the US - Business Insider</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPVUdETmFOUG5tQ3RYOHR2eG14Umpia2JZMW5SdFBLckJOMGYzOHNucXN2ZEJBSEZwa20yc1RNWnpaRDV2R2JuV0ZzWUhxM1F4b2xmQXZlb19vMjBkVEFtWjdYZGNJcVJSSHpYLTQ4bzJZblVUcUs2QWJEeXZCYUpqaVNrMmc1bmtj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="post-body-content post-story-body-content" data-component-type="post-body-content" data-load-strategy="exclude" data-track-content="" data-post-type="story"&gt;

A new study has found that linoleic acid, a type of fat found in eggs and soybeans and common in Western diets, can activate a key growth pathway in triple-negative &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/lifechanging-discovery-reduces-breast-cancer-recurrence/"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most difficult forms to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="how_cancer_growth_is_tied_to_nutrients"&gt;How cancer growth is tied to nutrients&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;All cells, including cancer cells, need to match their growth with available nutrients. A major player in this balancing act is a cellular signaling network called mTORC1. It acts like a sensor and regulator, helping cells grow when nutrients are available. This pathway is especially important in cancer biology, where abnormal growth is a hallmark. In breast cancer, mTORC1 signaling is disrupted in nearly half of all cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, researchers have focused mostly on how &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/eating-less-of-these-amino-acids-increases-lifespan-by-33-study-finds/"&gt;amino acids&lt;/a&gt; and glucose affect this pathway. But other nutrients, like essential fatty acids, haven’t been as deeply studied—especially when it comes to their direct effect on cancer cell behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Linoleic acid, found in seed oils like safflower and soybean oil as well as in animal products such as pork and eggs, can activate the mTORC1 pathway.

Your body can’t make these on its own. You get them from food. &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/high-levels-of-omega-3-omega-6-could-decrease-cancer-risk/"&gt;Omega-6 fats&lt;/a&gt; help make compounds that drive inflammation. Omega-3s, on the other hand, tend to have calming, anti-inflammatory effects. Yet until now, researchers hadn’t clearly shown how omega-6 fats might trigger cancer growth at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="linoleic_acid_fuels_a_specific_cancer_subtype"&gt;Linoleic acid fuels a specific cancer subtype&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings, published in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm9805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;, focus on triple-negative breast cancer. This form lacks three key receptors—estrogen, progesterone, and HER2—that are usually targeted in treatment. Because of this, triple-negative tumors are harder to treat and more aggressive than other types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study shows that linoleic acid, found in seed oils like safflower and soybean oil as well as in animal products such as pork and eggs, can activate the mTORC1 pathway—but only in triple-negative breast cancer cells. The secret lies in a protein called FABP5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;FABP5 acts as a fatty acid transporter. In triple-negative tumors, cells make high amounts of this protein. The researchers found that linoleic acid binds to FABP5. This binding sets off a chain reaction, ultimately flipping the “on” switch for the mTORC1 pathway. As a result, the tumor cells grow faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now know that linoleic acid feeds cancer cell growth in a very specific way,” said study senior author Dr. John Blenis, the Anna-Maria and Stephen Kellen Professor of Cancer Research in the Department of Pharmacology and a member of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at &lt;a href="https://weill.cornell.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Weill Cornell Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. “This discovery helps clarify the relationship between dietary fats and cancer, and sheds light on how to define which patients might benefit the most from specific nutritional recommendations in a personalized manner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_closer_look_at_the_mouse_model_and_real_patients"&gt;A closer look at the mouse model and real patients&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team tested their findings in mice with triple-negative breast cancer. When fed a high-linoleic-acid diet, these mice showed more tumor growth. They also had more FABP5 in their tumors and higher activation of mTORC1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;A mechanism is revealed through which ω-6 LA—the most abundant polyunsaturated fat in Western diets—activates mTORC1, the main regulator of cell growth.

The same pattern appeared: high levels of linoleic acid and FABP5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results strongly suggest that linoleic acid can promote &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/experimental-cancer-drug-eliminates-breast-cancer-bone-metastasis/"&gt;cancer growth&lt;/a&gt; in this subtype—and that FABP5 is the link. This is the first time a clear biological mechanism has been shown connecting linoleic acid from food to cancer progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nikos Koundouros, the study’s first author, believes this discovery could have broader implications. “There may be a broader role for FABP5-mTORC1 signaling in other cancer types and even in common chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also found early signs that the same fatty acid-FABP5 interaction might help fuel some types of prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Mammosphere formation efficiency of 1 × 103 HCC1806 and MCF7 single cells cultured for 12 days with 30 μM ω-6 LA or ω-3 ALA. n = 3 replicate wells. n.s., not significant; *P ≤ 0.05; determined by one-way ANOVA followed by two-tailed Student’s t test with Bonferroni correction.

Since the 1950s, as seed oil use has surged, so has linoleic acid consumption. Some experts have long questioned whether this trend might be linked to rising cancer rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of studies have tried to answer whether &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/walnuts-for-breakfast-the-natural-brain-boost-you-need/"&gt;omega-6 fats&lt;/a&gt; like linoleic acid cause cancer. But the results have been mixed and inconclusive. The problem was that most studies looked only at general patterns, not the biological reasons behind them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new research changes that. By finding a direct mechanism—one that only applies to a certain cancer subtype—it brings clarity. It shows that diet and disease might be more connected than we thought, but only under specific conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Triple-negative breast cancer makes up about 10-15% of all breast cancer cases. It tends to affect younger people and has fewer treatment options.

If a patient’s tumor has high levels of FABP5, cutting back on foods rich in linoleic acid might help slow the cancer’s growth. This approach wouldn’t replace treatment, but it could support it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;FABP5 might also become a useful biomarker.

While many participants experienced mood improvements after taking antidepressants for eight weeks, their cognitive abilities did not improve to the same degree. These findings highlight an important gap in current depression treatment: antidepressants can help with emotional symptoms but may not fully address problems with memory, attention, and mental speed, at least after two months of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is not just about feeling sad. It often comes with difficulties in thinking clearly, remembering things, or staying focused. These mental challenges—sometimes described as “brain fog”—can interfere with daily functioning, even when mood symptoms begin to lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past studies have shown that people with depression tend to perform worse than others on tests of memory, attention, and mental flexibility. However, most of those studies included people who had other medical or psychiatric conditions, or who were already taking medications that could influence thinking. The current study aimed to isolate the effects of depression itself by focusing on people who were otherwise healthy and unmedicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to better understand what specific cognitive functions are impaired in major depressive disorder and whether current antidepressant treatments address these deficits,” said study author Gwyneth W.Y Wu, a research scientist at the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By identifying potential treatment gaps, we hope to contribute to more comprehensive and targeted therapeutic strategies. Additionally, most studies comparing cognitive impairments in individuals with depression to controls do not specifically focus on medically healthy, unmedicated individuals. Our study aimed to identify cognitive performance specifically associated with depression, rather than medication or other underlying illnesses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, the researchers recruited 113 adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder and 88 adults without depression to serve as a comparison group. Everyone in the study was physically healthy and free of other psychiatric conditions, such as substance use disorders, bipolar disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder. None of the participants were taking medications known to affect brain function including antidepressant, anti-anxiety, or mood stabilizing medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression diagnoses were confirmed through structured interviews, and participants completed a series of well-known cognitive tests that measured areas like processing speed, executive function, and both visual and verbal memory. These tests were given to everyone at the start of the study. A subgroup of 69 people with depression went on to complete eight weeks of treatment with a commonly prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs). At the end of those eight weeks, they repeated the cognitive tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the study, people with depression performed worse than those without depression on several key measures. They scored significantly lower on a test called the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, which measures how quickly someone can process information and match symbols to numbers. They also struggled more on parts of the Stroop Test, which assesses how well someone can focus attention and ignore distracting information, as well as on the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test, which measures how well people can remember visual patterns. Interestingly, differences between the groups were not seen on all tasks—especially those involving verbal memory or simpler forms of attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at whether some people were more severely impaired than others. They defined clinical impairment as scoring more than 1.5 standard deviations below the population average. Compared to the healthy group, a larger portion of depressed participants showed this level of impairment in processing speed and visual memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings reinforce existing research, highlighting the link between cognitive deficits and major depressive disorder,” Wu told PsyPost. “We identified impairments in processing speed, visuospatial memory, and learning in unmedicated individuals with major depression. Additionally, we observed higher rates of clinical impairment in processing speed and both verbal and visual learning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings of impaired processing speed and visuospatial memory—without significant deficits in verbal memory or executive functioning—suggest that these cognitive abnormalities may be linked to dysfunction in specific structural or functional brain regions, but this requires further study. This highlights the possibility that depression-related cognitive impairment may affect certain domains more than others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After eight weeks of antidepressant treatment, the researchers reassessed cognitive function among the 69 treated participants. On the surface, the results seemed encouraging: people performed better on six of the thirteen cognitive tests, including measures of processing speed and visual memory. However, when the researchers dug deeper, they found that these improvements were not clearly linked to whether or not someone responded to antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, only one test—the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, which assesses verbal memory—showed a meaningful difference between people whose depression symptoms improved and those whose symptoms did not. On that test, those who responded to medication showed improved verbal learning over time, while non-responders actually did slightly worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While participants generally showed improved cognitive performance over the 8-week period, antidepressant response to SSRI treatment was not associated with cognitive gains,” Wu explained. “This underscores the need to consider cognition as an independent therapeutic target in the treatment of depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also tested whether baseline cognitive scores could predict who would respond to antidepressants. They found no differences in initial cognitive performance between those who later responded to medication and those who did not. This means that measuring cognitive ability at the start of treatment was not helpful in predicting which patients would benefit from medication. Although earlier studies have suggested that slower thinking or poor memory might signal a lower chance of improvement, this study—using a carefully selected sample—did not support that idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like all research, this study had limitations. The sample size was relatively large for this type of study, but it may still have been too small to detect subtle differences between responders and non-responders. The study also excluded people with other medical or psychiatric conditions, so the results may not apply to all patients with depression, especially those with more complex health profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study features a well-screened, relatively large cohort of unmedicated, physically healthy adults with major depressive disorder, free from substance use disorder or other comorbidities, along with a matched, never-depressed healthy control group,” Wu noted. “While these strict exclusion criteria strengthen the internal validity of our findings, they may limit the generalizability to broader populations, particularly those with comorbid physical or psychiatric conditions or those receiving pharmacological treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also possible that different aspects of depression improve on different timelines, and that cognitive symptoms might take longer to respond to treatment. “It would be nice to retest after four or six months, in addition to the two months we did,” Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the strengths of the study are notable. It is one of the few to examine cognitive function in unmedicated individuals with depression who are otherwise healthy. The researchers used a well-rounded set of cognitive tests and tracked changes over time, allowing them to compare baseline differences and treatment effects. They also confirmed that participants took their medication as prescribed by measuring drug levels in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope their work can inform more targeted treatments in the future. Long-term, they aim to develop strategies that address both the emotional and cognitive symptoms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While traditional depression treatments focus on alleviating mood symptoms, cognitive deficits often persist even after mood improvement,” Wu explained. “This dissociation between cognitive and depressive outcomes could have important clinical implications as even patients who respond symptomatically to SSRI treatment may still suffer from unaddressed cognitive deficits. Addressing this unmet need could lead to more comprehensive and functional patient outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depression research is critical to advancing our understanding of this complex and pervasive condition. By exploring both the emotional and cognitive dimensions of depression, we can develop more effective and personalized treatments. Ongoing research not only improves clinical outcomes but also paves the way for innovative therapies that can enhance patients’ quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.02.115" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cognitive function in physically healthy, unmedicated individuals with major depression: Relationship with depressive symptoms and antidepressant response&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Anna Ou, Gwyneth W.Y Wu, Michelle T.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients prescribed medicinal cannabis in Australia maintained improvements in overall health-related quality of life (HRQL), fatigue, and sleep disturbance across a one-year period, according to a study published in the open-access journal &lt;a href="https://plos.io/4bIvkNp" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;PLOS One&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Margaret-Ann Tait from The University of Sydney, Australia, and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Anxiety, depression, insomnia, and pain also improved over time for those with corresponding health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research into the therapeutic benefits of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medicinal+cannabis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medicinal cannabis&lt;/a&gt; has increased since the discovery of the analgesic properties in cannabis plant compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/advocacy+groups/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;advocacy groups&lt;/a&gt; lobbied the Australian government to bring about legislation changes that allow patients who were not responding to conventional treatment to access medicinal cannabis with a prescription from clinicians. More than one million new patients in Australia have received medicinal cannabis prescriptions for more than 200 health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multicenter prospective study called the QUEST initiative (QUality of life Evaluation STudy) recruited &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/adult+patients/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;adult patients&lt;/a&gt; with any &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+health+condition/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic health condition&lt;/a&gt; newly prescribed medicinal cannabis oil between November 2020 and December 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tait and colleagues gathered 12-month follow-up data to determine if previously reported improvements at three months would be maintained long-term. Of 2744 consenting participants who completed baseline assessments, 2353 also completed at least one follow-up questionnaire and were included in analyses, with completion rates declining to 778/2353 (38%) at 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Participants with clinician-diagnosed conditions completed questionnaires covering condition-specific symptoms, and HRQL, which encompasses physical, emotional, social, and cognitive function, as well as bodily discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that short-term improvements in overall HRQL reported at three months were maintained over a 12-month period in patients prescribed medicinal cannabis in Australia. People with chronic health conditions reported improvements in fatigue, pain, and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with anxiety, depression, insomnia, or &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+pain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic pain&lt;/a&gt; diagnoses also showed improvements in condition-specific symptoms over 12 months. Patients treated for generalized anxiety, chronic pain, insomnia, and PTSD all showed improvements in HRQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/movement+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;movement disorders&lt;/a&gt; had improved HRQL but no significant improvements in upper extremity function scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was large enough to assess patients across a wide range of chronic conditions and socio-demographics in a real-world setting. However, without a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/control+group/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;control group&lt;/a&gt;, it was not possible to confidently attribute changes over time to medicinal cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this limitation, the results suggest that prescribing medicinal cannabis to patients with chronic health conditions may improve pain, fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, and depression and overall HRQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings also suggest that any improvements would be apparent quickly and maintained long-term. According to the authors, the results from this study contribute to the emerging evidence base to inform decision-making both in clinical practice and at the policy level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors add, "This is promising news for patients who are not responding to conventional medicines for these conditions."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, researchers demonstrate in an animal how heavy alcohol use leads to long-term behavioral issues by damaging brain circuits critical for decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Rats exposed to high amounts of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/alcohol/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; exhibited poor &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/decision-making/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;decision-making&lt;/a&gt; during a complex task, even after a months-long withdrawal period. Key areas of their brains had undergone dramatic functional changes compared to healthy &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/rats/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;, provide a new explanation of alcohol's long-term effects on cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We now have a new model for the unfortunate cognitive changes that humans with alcohol-use disorder show," said author Patricia Janak, a Johns Hopkins University neuroscientist who studies the biology of addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know that humans who are addicted to alcohol can show deficits in learning and decision-making that may contribute to their poor decisions related to alcohol use. We needed an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/animal+model/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;animal model&lt;/a&gt; to better understand how chronic alcohol abuse affects the brain. Knowing what is happening in the brain of an animal when they are having these decision-making difficulties will tell us what is happening in humans."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In experiments led by first author Yifeng Cheng, a research scientist in Janak's lab who studies alcohol's effects on the brain, rats received very high alcohol exposure for a month. Then, after a withdrawal period of nearly three months, the rats were given a reward-based decision-making test along with a control group of rats that had not been exposed to alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;To get a reward, rats were given a choice of two levers. Pressing one lever led to a higher likelihood of reward than pressing the other lever. Rats easily learn which lever results in the most reward, so the researchers complicated things by every few minutes switching which lever had the highest reward likelihood. To get the most reward, a rat should rapidly change its behavior every time it figures out that the reward likelihood has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a difficult task that required memory and strategy. The alcohol-exposed rats performed considerably worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous experiments in animals weren't comparable to humans with alcohol use disorder because the animals didn't demonstrate deficits in rapid decision-making. The team believes this was because tasks in earlier experiments were too easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our experiment was quite challenging and the alcohol-exposed rats just couldn't do it as well," Janak said. "When the right answer was constantly changing, the control rats made the best decisions faster. They were more strategic. And when we looked at their brains, the control rats' decision-related neural signals were stronger."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team linked the behavioral difficulties to dramatic functional transformations in the dorsomedial striatum, a part of the brain critical for decision-making. The alcohol had damaged &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neural+circuits/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neural circuits&lt;/a&gt;, causing alcohol-exposed rats to process information less effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;One surprise was how long alcohol dependence impairs cognition and neural function, even after withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This may give us insight into why relapse rates for people addicted to alcohol are so high," Janak said. "Alcohol-induced neural deficits may contribute to decisions to drink even after going to rehab. We can clearly demonstrate these deficits can be long-lasting."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team only found the behavioral and neural impairments only in male rats. The team does not believe this suggests female rats are immune to the effects of alcohol, but that there could be sex-related sensitivities in long-term alcohol effects on brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers next hope to explore how alcoholism affects other areas of the brain that interact with the dorsomedial striatum, and what might be causing the differences between males and females.&lt;/p&gt;

Langdon of the National Institutes of Health; and Daeyeol Lee, a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of Neuroscience and Psychological and Brain Sciences at Johns Hopkins.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you've ever &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/wellness-us/article-13101007/narcissists-phrases-fighting-psychologists.html"&gt;argued with a narcissist&lt;/a&gt;, you already know that it's nearly impossible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They typically resort to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-13521415/Im-psychiatrist-5-myths-gaslighting-tell-happening-you.html"&gt;gaslighting and manipulation&lt;/a&gt; when they don't get their way - making it extremely hard to expect the truth out of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But psychologists say that this may no longer be the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the solution may just be in the messaging you're giving them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the study published in&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.psypost.org/scientists-discover-how-to-psychologically-inoculate-narcissists-against-dishonesty/"&gt; Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;, narcissists care deeply about how they're perceived by others even if they are prone to dishonesty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study looked at using an 'inoculation' technique with narcissists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Essentially, this means persuading someone to do something by convincing them not to do something else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They wanted to test this by having participants read a code of ethics and then conducting tests to see how they'd act afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Narcissists typically use gaslight and manipulation (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Except for one group, instead of the code of ethics explaining why people should have integrity, it featured information on what happens to people when they manipulate, lie, or cheat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This 'inoculation' version of the code of ethics warned students that people who engage in bad behaviors often end up with damaged reputations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The tests they conducted afterwards on these participants included measuring of both intentions and actual dishonest behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The assessment of intentions was based on Machiavellianism and psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was found that individuals that were found to 'score higher in narcissism' also reported to have more ethical intentions after reading the 'inoculation' message. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in terms of actual behavior, researchers used a coin-flipping test to see whether participants would cheat or not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As it turns out, those who were identified as narcissists were less likely to cheat during the test if they had read the 'inoculated' code of ethics first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Interestingly, those who did not score high in narcissism did not have great results after being exposed to the 'inoculation' message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Discouraging bad behavior and explaining those consequences can be more effective than simply encouraging good behavior (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, it made them more aware of potential justifications to bad behavior.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So what does this all really mean in terms of communicating with a narcissist?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rather than trying to appeal to their morality, it's better to accept that this isn't a strong suit of theirs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, you may be better off engaging them by speaking about something they might more likely be affected by: their reputation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By letting them know the way other people perceive them may be at stake if they engage in certain behaviors, you might just stop them from doing so.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

There have already been confirmed cases in &lt;a href="https://mix108.com/tags/wisconsin/" target="_blank"&gt;Wisconsin.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Candida Auris&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of the fungus is Candida Auris. It was first discovered in the United States in 2013. Since then, cases have risen sharply. East Coast states like New Jersey and New York have had the most cases, but the fungus has now spread to the Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungus made it's way to &lt;a href="https://mix108.com/tags/wisconsin/" target="_blank"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; border states, and then in 2022, the first case of the fungus appeared in &lt;a href="https://mix108.com/tags/wisconsin/" target="_blank"&gt;Wisconsin. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Primarily found in health care facilities.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who spend a lot of time in health care settings and have underlying medical issues are most at risk of C. auris.&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/candida-auris/tracking-c-auris/index.html?2023=All%20Years" target="_blank"&gt; It spreads in hospitals,&lt;/a&gt; long-term care facilities, and nursing homes. Most people who are sickened by C. auris have weakened immune systems and may have been receiving lots of antibiotics. People who also have lines or tubes in their bodies, such as catheters, feeding tubes, or breathing tubes are more likely to get infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Canadis Auris can live on surfaces for a long time.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;C. auris can survive and live on surfaces for several weeks. It can spread from healthy people who have it on their skin without knowing it. It's very difficult to get rid of it in a healthcare facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Most Healthy People Don't Need To Worry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy people's immune systems usually protect them from the fungus. That's also what makes it spread easily because people who have the fungus on their skin may not even know they are transmitting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Symptoms of Canadis Auris&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/disease/candida-auris.htm" target="_blank"&gt;The Wisconsin Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; warns that you may not notice symptoms of the deadly fungus because it affects people who are often already sick and in the hospital. A laboratory test is needed to see whether a patient has C. Auris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;30-60% of infected patients die.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;C. auris is considered a deadly infection as 30-60% of those infected will die from it. Antibiotics don't work on the fungus. The only treatment available is a drug called echinocandis, but the fungus has shown resistance to all antifungal medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most patients, it comes down to if their immune system can fight off the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wisconsin numbers low - for now.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wisconsin has 12 clinical cases, but bordering states like Illinois have over 1600 cases. Once the fungus starts to spread, cases rise sharply.

Well, a &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/science"&gt;neuroscientist&lt;/a&gt; has finally explained it to those who have been kept awake by the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“Just as your home accumulates waste that needs to be cleared away, your brain generates byproducts - such as extra proteins, cellular debris, and toxins - when its cells do their jobs.” &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-14560527/neuroscientist-remove-brain-waste-prevent-dementia-age.html"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Professor Ian McDonough to The Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;He further explained that your brain has special types of systems including something called microglia, which is the brain’s personal cleaning system, as well as the glymphatic and lymphatic systems, that also help to clear this waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;According to a neuroscientist, our brains have their own waste (Andrew Brookes / Getty)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;So when you hit the hay for the night, the glymphatic system becomes 'especially active', and clears the waste so that, like a toilet, your brain will be clean and free of things that it doesn’t need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;This, he said, is ‘like a nightly cleanup that prevents buildup and potential damage’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, as we get older, this system starts decline, as does our memory capacity. Professor McDonough says if we are able to 'clear waste in the brain', then 'pathology would never have a chance to clump and damage neurons and therefore, cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease would not occur'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, he adds that research around the topic is still new, and 'several lifestyle changes' may help towards our brain cleaning function, like getting a good night's sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A 2025 study from The &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/us-news"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; University School of Medicine and published on &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/boosting-brains-waste-removal-system-improves-memory-in-old-mice/"&gt;WashU Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, which McDonough also cited, explained that as we age, the brain loses the ability to cleanse itself of this waste, which scientists believe could be contributing to neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;They then discovered that by rejuvenating the network of vessels used to shift this waste, it could also help improve our memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;They used mice (Adam Gault / Getty)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Using elderly mice, the research team placed two identical black rods in their cage for twenty minutes for them to explore and exercise with, and the next day, the mice were given one of the black rods again alongside a new object- a silver rectangular prism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;According to the study, for the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/animals"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt; that remember playing with the black rod, they went on to spend more time with the new object - which Kyungdeok Kim, PhD, said indicated improved memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, old mice spent a similar amount of time playing with both objects as they couldn’t remember the rod from the day before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;After rejuvenating their systems, this changed and the old mice showed more interest in the new object, as well as also helping levels of IL-6 to drop, restoring their noise-cancelling system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Jonathan Kipnis, PhD, the Alan A. and Edith L. Wolff Distinguished Professor of Pathology &amp;amp; Immunology and a BJC Investigator at WashU Medicine said: "By targeting a network of vessels outside of the brain that is critical for brain health, we see cognitive improvements in mice, opening a window to develop more powerful therapies to prevent or delay cognitive decline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>UNILAD</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 17:35:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNMnJUbzlQbE9tTDlpMi1WZEdKczNZYmhXalZBN0p1X2U1eXFHcC1Od3dHYk5vQ2d0eXI0NTYtU1hjekx0dmJNV3BzdmlyaXNKdjRoWjNYZ1JSbGNfandsYm53UkN6SVlKUGJ0SG5NNjhhendWM1JEa3FnY1Nvc2NCbzBKNGNocG84c3ZUamxydDVneWUtdEg1V0JXUFE5MTFRcnJF</guid></item><item><title>Your brain isn't broken: That murderous rage over chewing sounds has a name - Boing Boing</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Boing Boing</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 17:26:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQQTdWWjI5UU9leGJjREJNU0pFQ21raGtBNFNVOWpBbzJ6QXZoMWJEQzBNNldqVWd3MUVwaDg2TlFQbDNyLUNGN1ZmRXM4SnVMUTJmLVBrelNHeGNUV19Wenhfc1V1bDQ2dk40YzJEd2MtWVI2bGg2ODZiMThmWF9oUVV2RjBFcV9ILW9PbGs2MzZfSHMyM0RrQ1lwd0xNVl9ucHc1LWN1S1JFeXVlR0xaUGRn0gG3AUFVX3lxTE1sWmIzcllxZDhIZEdNNm9lelVlY3liMHdyeW1TZ0hZeG1HWUJKaWpOWXhDS19CS2xMT0dyRnNVQ2k4VFN4OFdCX3ZhcWNEXzRtRmlOLWE3TFlhUTRaMmVCUm9HLWNoRTU5NWxxc2h1RjhsVVEwWFYyblZUSGtJdXVHbHlxVUNaOGdRaFBfTlVnUTNsZ0pKTGIxclFEaEhKZzY2NXdXY2dlXy1OR2dWa2lHd1VjZDhmRQ</guid></item><item><title>Surge in Virginia syphilis cases alarms physicians - Daily Press</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE82cl9XMnVSamFnYm4zeVVTdkF2czVtdmdRR1M4SlVOYWNURjU3MFZkYm1YdkFhUGFIN25GdGlYeGZ3OE40dzdHUTJ3X2VaZFcxejJHNldVbFoyUjBnU0JESWdzSlFLSm94ZEJWVWpMS2gxbHpTNFNnNTR0Zw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy mng-subscriber-content"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Dr. Susan Girois was training as a physician in the 1990s, she doesn’t remember diagnosing a single case of syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, four or five patients a week regularly appear at a clinic run by the Norfolk Department of Public Health, where Girois serves as director. A recent surge in cases of the bacterial infection, usually spread by sexual contact, has alarmed her and other physicians across Hampton Roads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As cases have climbed in all demographics locally and across Virginia and the country — even in newborns and seniors — a regional collaboration called the Stop Syphilis Coalition is launching a public awareness campaign this month to educate residents and providers on risk factors, symptoms and screening recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our region has some of the highest rates of syphilis in Virginia,” Girois said. “This needs to be at the top of people’s minds, because it can be such a devastating and even deadly infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-aGsPBxFR" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_aGsPBxFR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by the Virginia Department of Health and the M.

(Kendall Warner / The Virginian-Pilot)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top goals include promoting screening for all pregnant women — who can pass an infection to their baby, increasing conversations between physicians and patients on prevention and testing options, expanding screening in emergency rooms and outpatient settings, and strengthening data tracking and contact tracing methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of pregnancy, current federal health guidelines call for screening at-risk, sexually-active teenagers and adults, especially if they are between the ages of 15 and 44 and live in areas with high rates of syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have multiple sexual partners, gay or bisexual men, and patients with HIV or another sexually-transmitted infection are among the groups in high-risk categories; having unprotected oral, vaginal or anal sex further raises the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left untreated, syphilis can lead to serious and even life-threatening damage to the brain, spinal cord, heart, liver, blood vessels, joints, eyes and ears. An infection in unborn babies, known as congenital syphilis, also increases the odds of premature birth and stillbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In older patients, syphilis typically starts as a single sore on the genitals, rectum or mouth that is firm yet painless. The infection spreads mainly through direct contact with those lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The word ‘sore’ is misleading, unfortunately, as these lesions generally don’t hurt,” said Dr. Charles Frazier, senior vice president and chief medical information and innovation officer at Riverside Health System. “People might ignore them or not even be aware of them, but they need to get checked as quickly as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that syphilis is 100% treatable with penicillin. Most adult patients are cured with just one injection of the antibiotic; others may need two or three if the disease has progressed to a later stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have had unprotected sex with an infected partner, or who don’t know a partner’s history, also may be candidates for doxycycline, an antibiotic that can be taken as a “morning after” treatment to potentially stop syphilis from developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most newborns with congenital syphilis, however, must spend 10 days on intravenous penicillin in intensive care. Without quick treatment, complications can include rashes, fever, anemia, bone changes, developmental delays, swelling in the spleen and liver and hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every case of congenital syphilis is a preventable tragedy,” Girois noted. “Our message is that if you’re pregnant, please, please seek prenatal care.” Obstetricians generally screen expectant mothers at their first appointment and again at 28 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syphilis cases have been climbing steadily in Virginia in recent years, with Hampton Roads a frequent hot spot — particularly for congenital syphilis. In 2024, the Eastern Virginia Health Region accounted for 15 of the state’s 36 congenital cases, according to VDH data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials aren’t sure what’s behind the rise, although a higher number of infected patients naturally leads to more widespread transmission. Girois also theorizes that the intense fear of STIs that drove safe sex practices at the height of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has subsided as fewer patients die of that infection; more adults, meanwhile, are continuing to date into their senior years, when they don’t need protection to prevent pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syphilis is a complex infection with four stages. Most patients first develop a lesion about three weeks after infection. Next, they may experience a rash that can start on the trunk of the body and spread to the limbs, palms of the hands or soles of the feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Untreated patients then enter a “latent” phase, when bacteria remain in their bodies but may not cause symptoms for months or years. Those who progress to a final stage, tertiary syphilis, can face dementia, paralysis, balance problems, heart failure and vision and/or hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stop Syphilis Coalition plans to conduct a widespread print and social media education campaign and provide fact sheets to community-based providers and organizations who encounter at-risk populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members also are discussing changing strategies within health care systems. Riverside, for example, has built educational links on syphilis into its electronic medical records system, easily accessed by its community-based providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_7515399" class="wp-caption alignright size-article_inline_third"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class=" lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.dailypress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-02-120431.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="Dr. Lawrence Leslie, deputy medical director for the Emergency Department at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital.

(Courtesy of Sentara Health)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Sentara, emergency department leaders are developing stronger protocols to ensure prompt screening of at-risk patients such as those with HIV, gonorrhea and/or chlamydia, all STIs. That could involve offering more onsite tests along with referrals to outpatient providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to develop the most streamlined pathway to get people into the right setting for education, follow-up testing and treatment,” said Dr. Lawrence Leslie, deputy medical director for the Emergency Department at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital. “Hopefully this is an area where we can make an immediate impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, screening soon could become easier with new rapid blood tests, which can deliver results about 15 minutes after a finger prick. Previously, samples have gone to a laboratory with about a two-day turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being able to treat people before they walk out the door would be a gamechanger,” Girois said. “It’s time for us to be much more systematic about offering testing. It’s time for a full-court press.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For information, data and resources on syphilis for both the general public and medical providers, visit &lt;a href="http://vdh.virginia.gov/norfolk/syphilis-resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;vdh.virginia.gov/norfolk/syphilis-resources&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://vdh.virginia.gov/syphilis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;vdh.virginia.gov/syphilis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alison Johnson, ajohnsondp@yahoo.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Bamberger fears that the mayor’s new policy will further limit opportunities to treat such patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left" id=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think about the process of some dude at the end of their speed run, and they don’t have a pipe in front of them,” he said. “They’re tweaking. They’re a mess. They’re going to turn to their buddy who’s using fentanyl and say, ‘Can I use your pipe?’ And then they’re dead.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left" id=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco AIDS Foundation expressed additional concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left" id=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are disappointed that the distribution of safer smoking supplies will be limited throughout all public spaces in San Francisco, ignoring guidance from leading authorities in evidence-based drug policy,” said CEO Tyler TerMeer. He warned that the policy “may push people toward injection drug use, increasing the risk of fatal overdose and the transmission of HIV, hepatitis C, and other infectious diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left" id=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, TerMeer said, the foundation remains committed to working with the mayor’s office, the SF Department of Public Health, and community partners to advance solutions “that prioritize compassion and evidence-based care over fear and stigma.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left" id=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foundation will continue offering support services at all locations, including substance use disorder treatment, medical care, HIV and HCV screening and treatment, overdose prevention, and mental health support services, TerMeer added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The San Francisco Standard</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 16:52:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPeGRIaDVrbm5TVG0taDB1V2NOaXlhMWpqMy02Ukt1ZWhidWZ4ZktCTUNLWXU4ZEdTSF8wQTVmRkt2T3hMUDNFQzFBRzVzeWhLTFp0NkY3elRKMGJyMXduenY4UmxlTElBYmZ0SFBaakJYVTBxRjJFMjZtc1dxUTVOUFR1WW5ZU1lUWmZYczBCX0dwZFRKVE5idUgxVjQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
