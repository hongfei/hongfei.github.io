			&lt;p&gt;Honing in on the junk-food pyramid to rank its most harmful members, researchers from Virginia Tech have discovered that ultra-processed meats and beverages are the worst for brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who consumed one or more extra servings of either of these foods showed a significantly increased risk of developing cognitive impairments, including those associated with forms of dementia such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="178582" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from the University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study, the researchers tracked 4,750 US residents aged 55 or older to evaluate how their health had evolved over a period of up to 7 years, assessing their cognitive status every two years from 2014 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-daily-diet-of-burgers-and-pizzas-could-be-putting-you-at-risk-of-alzheimers"&gt;A Daily Diet of Burgers And Pizzas Could Be Putting You at Risk of Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Similar studies have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-processed-foods-could-sabotage-weight-loss-even-on-a-healthy-diet"&gt;previously explored&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-processed-foods-linked-to-early-signs-of-parkinsons-disease"&gt;adverse effects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-review-of-ultra-processed-foods-confirms-just-how-harmful-they-are"&gt;in general&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, though researchers had yet to compare discrete categories. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The health costs of a diet heavy in UPFs are now known to include &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advnut.2023.09.009"&gt;obesity, type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, cardiovascular diseases, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2024.11.011"&gt;anxiety, depression&lt;/a&gt;, and an increase in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2023-078476"&gt;all-cause mortality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, diets high in UPFs also have a detrimental impact on brain health. However, a more specific question remained: which specific junk foods were driving these associations, if any?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer (sadly, for many) encompasses some of the most-consumed comfort foods known to culinary science: meats and beverages, meaning that a meat-lover's pizza and a cola could combine to create a double brain-bomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178596" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178596" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/soda_meat_642.jpg" alt="meat and soda" class="wp-image-178596 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/soda_meat_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/soda_meat_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178596" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Sugary drinks like sodas and heavily processed meats were the big offenders. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAGAIwPVt2c/"&gt;PIXTA/creator9866433/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the overall association with cognitive decline, the researchers employed common brain health evaluations. They tested both immediate and delayed recall capacity, along with other assessments such as counting backward or subtracting several numbers in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, 1,363 of the participants developed cognitive impairment. Those who consumed at least one extra serving of ultra-processed animal products per day showed a 17 percent heightened risk of developing cognitive issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar-sweetened beverages, such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-diet-soda-a-day-may-raise-your-type-2-diabetes-risk-by-38"&gt;sodas&lt;/a&gt;, iced teas, and sugary fruit drinks, were only a bit less brain-rotting, as individuals who consumed at least one extra serving per day showed a 6 percent increase in the risk of developing cognitive issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study found that total UPF consumption was not significantly associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment. Neither were other UPFs, such as spreads, sweets, savory snacks, grain- and dairy-based foods, or ready-to-eat meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, this new research shows that patients have a simple, if not necessarily easy, avenue for protecting their brain health: making dietary changes to avoid ultra-processed meats and sodas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are things that you can change," &lt;a href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2025/09/clahs-food-cognition-research.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Brenda Davy, professor of human nutrition, foods, and exercise at Virginia Tech and the study's co-author. "It's moderation and being reasonable and balanced in your dietary choices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the overabundance of junk food may be shocking. About &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lana.2024.100713"&gt;65 percent of foods and 38 percent&lt;/a&gt; of beverages bought by US households in 2020 were considered UPFs, which are characterized by high industrial processing and the presence of artificial colors, flavorings, and emulsifiers – additives that aren't present in home-cooked meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, both the younger generations and older adults get more than half their daily calories from these UPFs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest cooking classes could offer a crucial healthcare intervention – knowing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-vs-minimally-processed-food-simple-tips-to-make-better-choices"&gt;what to eat&lt;/a&gt;, and how to prepare it, can be half the battle when making better food choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Virginia Tech human development scientist Ben Katz &lt;a href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2025/09/clahs-food-cognition-research.html"&gt;concludes&lt;/a&gt;, "It's one thing to follow a diet, but it's another thing to give [people] the cooking skills to prepare that diet." So while the junk-food statistics may seem daunting, at least there's a clear and achievable strategy for dealing with decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is published in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916525000760"&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcjpqa200003b6n8gf7x5v4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Happier people are &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1069072717751441" target="_blank"&gt;more successful in their careers&lt;/a&gt;, have &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jopy.12910" target="_blank"&gt;more fulfilling relationships&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091743519302300" target="_blank"&gt;live longer, healthier lives&lt;/a&gt;, previous research has shown. Now, scientists say they have identified the “happiness threshold” needed for a country’s population as a whole to achieve certain health benefits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83c00013b6n6mtuiz71@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Specifically, a nation’s happiness level can influence its people’s risk of premature death from chronic illnesses such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes and respiratory disease, according to a study published October 20 in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medicine/articles/10.3389/fmed.2025.1667645/full" target="_blank"&gt;Frontiers in Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83c00023b6nggl0u0p0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The research team used a scale called the Life Ladder to estimate the happiness levels of 123 countries. Zero represents the worst possible life imaginable and 10 the best.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83c00033b6nes3lqevn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Once a country surpassed a score of 2.7, its happiness was tied to a decrease in deaths due to chronic or noncommunicable diseases among people 30 to 70 years old, researchers found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83c00043b6n1sumygob@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scores ranged from 2.18 to 7.97, with an average of 5.45. The United States was among the countries analyzed, but individual Life Ladder scores weren’t published in the study. However, the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/worlds-happiest-countries-2025-wellness"&gt;2025 World Happiness Report&lt;/a&gt;, ranks the US as the world’s 24th-happiest country, with a score of 6.72.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83d00053b6ngkeg119x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Policies that lift national Life-Ladder scores above the 2.7 threshold — through investments in health systems, anti-corruption reforms, social safety nets, and healthy urban environments — can initiate a reinforcing cycle of higher happiness and lower mortality,” lead study author Iulia Iuga said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83d00063b6nt2kfjb1d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The evidence suggests that raising well-being while curbing obesity, alcohol use, and pollution could produce dual dividends: stronger happiness and healthier, longer lives.”&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83d00073b6nlmovj9cc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For countries at or above the 2.7 threshold, “improving well-being can measurably extend &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/12/health/global-mortality-risk-factors-adolescents-young-adults"&gt;life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; when societies reach a basic level of stability and satisfaction,” said Iuga, a professor in the department of finance and accounting at 1 Decembrie 1918 University of Alba Iulia in Romania.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83d00083b6nukkd5aki@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Iuga hopes her team’s work has implications for governing bodies and public health organizations that can influence happiness and health at the population level. She plans to continue her research by testing the happiness threshold against other health metrics, such as years lived with a disability.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmhcml8d0000b3b6nl0qijsgs@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="more-than-just-fun-and-pleasure" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        ‘More than just fun and pleasure’
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83d00093b6nvhs7k28n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Each 1% increase in well-being correlated to a 0.43% decrease in the chronic-disease mortality rate among adults 30 to 70 years old, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcml83d000a3b6n5bo4hhh5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This research adds to the existing body of literature linking happiness to health, said Sonja Lyubomirsky, a distinguished professor of psychology and director of the Positive Activities and Well-Being Laboratory, or &lt;a href="https://sonjalyubomirsky.com/pawlab/" target="_blank"&gt;PAWLab&lt;/a&gt;, at the University of California, Riverside, who wasn’t involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhck9gnf000r3b6nlen3d8dt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Traditionally, happiness is seen as a little bit of a luxury. It feels good,” Lyubomirsky said. The new study shows “that happiness could be the public health variable. It’s about more than just fun and pleasure.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000e3b6nqm0qgitk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Happiness is but one facet of a person’s health. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/20/health/obesity-genetic-wellness"&gt;Genetic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/23/health/alcohol-dementia-risk-study-wellness"&gt;behavioral&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/30/health/airborne-microplastics-study-wellness"&gt;environmental&lt;/a&gt; factors also play a role in the risk of dying from chronic disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000f3b6ncdisn5ca@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We don’t want to leave people the impression that if only they were happier, they would be healthier, they would be fine,” Lyubomirsky said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000g3b6npcul1ff3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s also important to avoid placing blame, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000h3b6nk0kj015l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You don’t want to say, ‘If you don’t live as long, then it’s your fault because you’re not happy enough,’” she said. Not to mention, you only have so much control over your happiness as it relates to where you live. You might be born into a politically unstable country through no fault of your own or unable to afford to move out of an area with poor air quality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000i3b6n6nfss9q0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Having spent decades studying the well-being of individuals, Lyubomirsky said gauging the happiness of entire countries comes with challenges.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000j3b6n3w5x0fjd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s really hard,” she said. “You cannot get a sample of every single person in the country, so you want to make sure that’s a representative sample.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000k3b6ne19nc56c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers cited incomplete data on countries in conflict and low-income nations as a limitation of the study. In addition, longevity analysis is limited because mortality data for noncommunicable diseases didn’t go beyond age 70.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000l3b6nhwq44s25@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Saida Heshmati, director of the Human Emotion and Relationships across Time and Culture, or &lt;a href="https://heshmatiheartlab.com/" target="_blank"&gt;HEART Lab&lt;/a&gt;, at Claremont Graduate University in California, said happiness isn’t the word she’d use to describe what the study is trying to measure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmln3r000m3b6nc42g2tbn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When we say ‘happiness,’ people tend to think about experiencing more positive emotions — joy and having meaning in life and having a sense of accomplishment,” said Heshmati, also an assistant professor of psychology, who wasn’t involved in the research. “The (Life Ladder) doesn’t necessarily get into those components.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhckjjpd00133b6n6rrnt16p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Heshmati referred to the &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/rwe/10.1007/978-94-007-0753-5_259" target="_blank"&gt;Cantril Self-Anchoring Striving Scale&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes called Cantril’s Ladder, a standardized well-being assessment that serves as the basis for the Life Ladder scores in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmly6a000o3b6nrb9z7nao@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This isn’t about happiness as a fleeting emotion,” Heshmati said. “It’s really about this general life satisfaction cognitive evaluation, which is a reflection of whether societies are providing those material, social and psychological foundations for people to thrive.”

            The authors of the new study pulled data about health factors including air pollution, body mass index and alcohol consumption from the &lt;a href="https://www.gallup.com/analytics/318875/global-research.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Gallup World Poll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators" target="_blank"&gt;World Development Indicators&lt;/a&gt; collected from 2006 through 2021.

            Noncommunicable diseases accounted for at least 43 million deaths globally, or 75% of non-pandemic-related deaths, in 2021, according to WHO. Nearly 42% of those people died prematurely, before age 70.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Eighty percent of premature deaths due to noncommunicable diseases that year were attributed to four disease groups: &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/29/health/heart-disease-risk-factors-wellness"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; (19 million deaths); &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/16/health/early-onset-colorectal-cancer-wellness"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; (10 million deaths); &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/28/health/copd-lung-disease-wellness"&gt;chronic respiratory disease&lt;/a&gt; (4 million deaths); and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/08/health/diabetes-undiagnosed-half-of-americans-wellness"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; (2 million deaths).

            Countries with higher per-person health spending — what a person spends on doctor visits and prescription medications, for example — generally exceeded the happiness threshold. Ethiopia had the lowest per-capita spending at $9 in 2006, while the US had the highest at $12,000 in 2021. The average across all countries evaluated was $1,300.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;

            Heshmati likes to think of the happiness threshold as a stability threshold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmm8wd000v3b6nzsl0s9ga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you’re below that threshold, it seems you’re in stress mode and survival mode,” she said, which can have physiological consequences.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhckjyr000193b6nxk5tugdv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While individual well-being adds up to represent the happiness of a nation, Heshmati cautions against applying the study’s conclusions to your own health and risk of death from chronic disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmmhii000x3b6n1q8q2i8i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We can’t just say that becoming or feeling slightly happier directly changes your biology,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhcmmhii000y3b6n2dsllmzt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Heshmati recommends thinking about your own happiness holistically. Simple pleasures matter, she said, but they come and go and can leave a sense of emptiness due to their fleeting nature. Instead, focus on lasting markers of well-being such as maintaining strong social ties, cultivating a sense of purpose and pursuing goals that make you feel accomplished.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Those are more of the long-term virtues that help us live life to the fullest,” she said.

The good news: Elevated and high blood pressure can &lt;em data-node-id="8.3"&gt;often &lt;/em&gt;(but not always) be addressed with diet and lifestyle modifications, said Dr. Phillips. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="causes-of-high-blood-pressure" data-node-id="9" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emevuu60"&gt;Causes of high blood pressure &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="10" class="body-h3 css-1kae8qb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="10.0"&gt;1.

And of that, more than 70% of a person’s sodium intake is coming from processed and restaurant foods, including things like bread, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g28567921/best-healthy-cereals/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g28567921/best-healthy-cereals/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="breakfast cereal" data-node-id="13.5" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;breakfast cereal&lt;/a&gt;, chips, cookies, pizza, canned beans and veggies, canned soups, and pasta sauce—not the salt shaker itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Additionally, a diet heavy in processed foods can cause weight gain, and “when people are overweight, the body has to pump blood to more tissue, which can increase blood pressure,” said Dr. Phillips. “We see an extremely large amount of high blood pressure in obese patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="15" class="body-h4 css-1p51vha emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;BP fix: Favor fresh, whole foods whenever possible&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Instead, load up on whole foods rich in beneficial nutrients, like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, fish, nuts, seeds, and olive oil, suggested Dr. Beniaminovitz. &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a63237886/foods-high-in-potassium/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a63237886/foods-high-in-potassium/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Potassium" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="16.1.0"&gt;Potassium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g20105121/magnesium-deficiency-symptoms/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g20105121/magnesium-deficiency-symptoms/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="magnesium" data-node-id="16.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="16.3.0"&gt;magnesium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are both minerals that &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/key-minerals-to-help-control-blood-pressure" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/key-minerals-to-help-control-blood-pressure" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="help blood vessels relax" data-node-id="16.5" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="16.5.0"&gt;help blood vessels relax&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn can help lower blood pressure; and &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.22575" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.22575" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="research" data-node-id="16.7" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; links high-fiber diets to significant reductions in systolic blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If you want to follow a specific dietary plan that’s been proven to lower blood pressure, Dr. Beniaminovitz recommended either the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a20455774/lower-blood-pressure-dash-diet/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a20455774/lower-blood-pressure-dash-diet/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet" data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="17.1.0"&gt;DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or a well-formulated &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/diets/a30326160/mediterranean-diet/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/diets/a30326160/mediterranean-diet/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mediterranean Diet" data-node-id="17.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="17.3.0"&gt;Mediterranean Diet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="youre-having-more-than-one-alcoholic-drink-per-day" data-node-id="18" class="body-h3 css-1kae8qb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="18.0"&gt;2.

And if it’s really more about the ritual than the alcohol itself, consider periodically swapping out your glass of cabernet for a kombucha or other non-alcoholic option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="youre-not-getting-enough-exercise" data-node-id="22" class="body-h3 css-1kae8qb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="22.0"&gt;3.

Sedentary people tend to be overweight or obese, and as mentioned above, weight is one of the main driving causes of high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Additionally, getting regular aerobic activity helps you maintain a healthy blood pressure by making blood vessels more compliant (or flexible) and less sensitive to hormonal influences, he explained—so a lack of such activity may accelerate arterial hardening, forcing the heart and blood vessels to work that much harder. &lt;strong data-node-id="24.1"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="25" class="body-h4 css-1p51vha emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="25.0"&gt;BP fix: Get your body moving.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/53/14/859.full" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/53/14/859.full" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="research analysis" data-node-id="26.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="26.1.0"&gt;research analysis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of nearly 400 studies suggests that regular exercise could be as effective as commonly prescribed blood pressure drugs. “In the pantheon of physical activity, aerobic exercising is the best for blood pressure,” said Dr. Beniaminovitz. The &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="American Heart Association" data-node-id="26.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; recommends aiming for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise per week (about 20 to 30 minutes a day) such as biking, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/workouts/a19695821/speed-walking-increase-calorie-burn/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/workouts/a19695821/speed-walking-increase-calorie-burn/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="brisk walking" data-node-id="26.5" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;brisk walking&lt;/a&gt;, swimming, a barre class, or even higher-speed varieties of yoga like vinyasa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="youre-chronically-stressed" data-node-id="27" class="body-h3 css-1kae8qb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="27.0"&gt;4. You’re stressed all the time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;From an evolutionary standpoint, stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline are released into the blood to help us escape danger (to fight or flee). They increase heart rate, elevate blood pressure, constrict blood vessels, and enlarge our pupils to help us think and move fast, explained Dr. Beniaminovitz. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;In the past, the stressful event was typically over pretty quickly—but today, relentless work demands, overbooked schedules, challenging relationships, and even social media have led to an epidemic of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/mental-health/a61928322/mediterranean-diet-lowers-stress-levels-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/mental-health/a61928322/mediterranean-diet-lowers-stress-levels-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="chronic stress" data-node-id="29.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="29.1.0"&gt;chronic&lt;/em&gt; stress&lt;/a&gt;, which triggers the same release of stress hormones. But unlike our ancestral past, there’s often no reprieve—it’s constant—and thus, blood pressure may remain elevated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="30" class="body-h4 css-1p51vha emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="30.0"&gt;BP fix: Find your zen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Physical activity is one of the most effective ways to reduce levels of stress hormones and minimize their impact on blood pressure, said Dr. Beniaminovitz. Mindfulness practices like deep breathing, meditation, and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/workouts/g30417941/best-yoga-stretches/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/workouts/g30417941/best-yoga-stretches/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="yoga" data-node-id="31.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt;, or even reading a book or listening to your favorite music, can also keep stress hormones in check. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;You may also need to cut &lt;em data-node-id="32.1"&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; certain activities, like checking those work emails at all hours. “People have to get to know themselves and their triggers, and how they may be able to remove themselves from situations that increase stress and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/mental-health/a22502279/anxiety-disorder-symptoms-signs/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/mental-health/a22502279/anxiety-disorder-symptoms-signs/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="anxiety" data-node-id="32.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;,” said Dr. Phillips.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="youre-feeling-lonely-or-socially-isolated" data-node-id="33" class="body-h3 css-1kae8qb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.0"&gt;5.

But if the idea of putting yourself out there seems impossible, start small. Send a friend a quick DM to say you’re thinking of them and see where things go. Combine physical activity &lt;em data-node-id="36.1"&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; social time by committing to a weekly Saturday morning yoga class with a pal.

You have a family history of hypertension. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="49" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Genes do play &lt;em data-node-id="49.1"&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; role in high blood pressure, which is why younger people in seemingly great health can still be diagnosed with hypertension, said Dr. Phillips. However, more often than not, it’s also likely that people with a family history of high blood pressure share common environments (similar diets, similar sedentary lifestyles, etc.) that increase their risk—and these are very much modifiable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="50" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“Our genes also interact with the environment and we can influence them by the choices we make,” said Dr. Beniaminovitz. “While lifestyle changes may not help you in &lt;em data-node-id="50.1"&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; developing high blood pressure if you have a strong family history, optimal lifestyle will aid in delaying the onset of blood pressure and the need for early medications. Instead of developing high blood pressure in your 30s or 40s, with optimal diet and lifestyle you may delay the onset of high blood pressure to your late 60s or 70s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="51" class="body-h4 css-1p51vha emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="51.0"&gt;BP fix: Implement the tips above!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="52" class="body-text css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;There’s no magic bullet, but if you have a strong family history, that’s even more reason to implement all of the dietary and lifestyle recommendations above—eat whole foods, move your body more, manage stress—and get your blood pressure checked regularly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 12:28:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE1wUkY4WHFzZ3ZKOWdMSlhyWkpiQkNrQ29NMnlTOEJJUGk5eHphU2hpRUtvb0s5bFVBbWRYZnI2QURxeFNSYXdxODRhUWZ1MXViRGNLcmRmenhwaHB1NGZ2ak10cVlzVVVJdkZub0YzeDdoV1pWQ0ozQURBOA</guid></item><item><title>更新：俄亥俄州山顶俄亥俄州Hi-Point职业中心发生两起三车相撞事故</title><link>https://www.peakofohio.com/featured-news/three-vehicle-crash-closes-route-47-at-ohio-hi-point-career-center/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Peak of Ohio</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 12:10:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPZEU5UG96NnV6YU8tNUN2UFBBbkJRUFY2S0JabDBEY0Y0ZUJZS3ctel9NSXBtNEtpVXJVal80N242ZDFjaFozQjhaUndaN0VHSHZMTHlWYlNlZDY3ZzVpbFpyeUMxT3JIa3Z2c1NIOTl1ZVVleGFMVVUwaE5SWjhRdGE1SmJqSFp0RDNGbDdXQ3cyZEpVVGY0MGlSNGJLbDl3bzE2VDRaOWZKakRP</guid></item><item><title>改变生活方式，降低患痴呆症的风险-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/try-this/simple-lifestyle-changes-to-reduce-your-risk-of-dementia/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="Episode_episode-description__mlBrI Episode_episode-content-wrapper__8Q2oZ"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As we age, we can develop a higher risk for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.

Decades of research shows that people who are thinner tend to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.94.3.468"&gt;&lt;em&gt;make more money&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1021470813182"&gt;&lt;em&gt;attain higher-status jobs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, particularly women in white-collar workplaces. It’s understandable, then, that people would put a lot of effort (and money) into how they look in order to maintain a professional edge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4awjrr000h3b78z8dqoeeh@published" data-word-count="51"&gt;&lt;em&gt;More recently, GLP-1 weight-loss drugs have entered the arena of self-maintenance. In fields where personal appearance is prized, they’ve become commonplace, if not normal. But at what cost? Here, three people in different industries who are taking the drugs for professional purposes — and feel conflicted about it — share their experiences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4ax578000z3b780u92irpc@published" data-word-count="8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Ann, 45, director at a bank in Manhattan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The frat-house culture is real. And most of the women who work in this industry fit the same mold. They look like hot, thin sorority girls in business attire. Maybe things have changed in the past ten or 20 years — they probably used to be worse — but the truth is, there’s a ton of pressure to look a certain way. There’s no open discrimination against people for being fat or ugly; you just don’t see any in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4azlnu003z3b78nb0q17e8@published" data-word-count="81"&gt;I started taking a GLP-1 about a year ago, after another woman I work with told me she was taking it. My first thought, when she told me, was, &lt;em&gt;Shit, I have to take this too if I don’t want to be the biggest girl at the office.&lt;/em&gt; I wish I could say I was taking it for my health, or because it made me feel better physically, but the truth is that I’m taking it because I’m afraid not to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4azlnu00403b781gzbmpni@published" data-word-count="141"&gt;I remember the first time I realized that my weight could be a professional liability. I was working on a trading desk right out of college, almost 20 years ago, and during my first performance review, my manager told me that he’d received some comments on my professional attire and that I should review the employee handbook regarding dress code. He clearly felt really awkward about this, and I thought I was going to die of embarrassment. I knew the real issue was my weight. I always followed the dress code — I wore a suit every day — but I’d gained about 15 pounds that year and some of my clothes no longer fit well. I did those juice cleanses, which are obviously terrible for you, and managed to lose some of the weight. But it was a constant battle.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4azlnv00413b78h5707wrt@published" data-word-count="51"&gt;I’ve never been obese, but I’ve always been on the bigger side. I have the kind of metabolism where, if I don’t work out regularly and watch what I eat, I will go up a size immediately. My weight fluctuates a lot. A lot of people in my family are overweight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4azlnv00423b78u0eyvuy5@published" data-word-count="109"&gt;When I decided to start a GLP-1, I didn’t even know where to get it. I was too embarrassed to go to an actual doctor, and I was pretty sure they wouldn’t prescribe it to me anyway, because I wasn’t technically overweight. I wound up using one of those online telehealth platforms. You answer a bunch of questions and send a picture of yourself. The first time I went through the process, I answered all the questions honestly, and they wouldn’t prescribe me a GLP-1; they suggested some other weight-loss regimen. So I tried it again and lied about my weight and said it was higher, and it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4azlnw00433b78axoye2eb@published" data-word-count="135"&gt;I take Zepbound, and it is expensive — about $1,300 a month. The medication itself costs around $1,100 for four prefilled pens, and then I pay another $150 for a “membership” to the telehealth platform’s weight-loss program. I could probably save that $150 by finding a doctor who would prescribe it to me, but I don’t know where to start with that. And doing it online is just much easier, so it’s worth it to me. I haven’t told anyone I’m doing it, not even my husband. He’s the kind of person who never struggles with his weight, so I don’t think he’d understand, and he’d probably be worried about me. I’m kind of hoping that a pill or something will come out that I can take instead, and at that point I’ll tell him.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4azlnx00443b78knnc8rzg@published" data-word-count="161"&gt;I feel really conflicted about the fact that I’ve been doing this. Yes, I’ve lost weight — about 20 pounds — and it’s a huge relief to not have to worry about whether my pants are going to fit. I can’t overstate how great it is to take that piece of stress out of my life. In that sense, it’s a miracle. But there are &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/11/ozempic-side-effects.html"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; — the usual ones you hear about. I also hate that I feel like I have to do this to maintain what’s considered a professional appearance. I’m well aware that by making myself fit this mold, I’m perpetuating the problem. This should not be normal, and it goes against my values. But increasingly, living your values seems like a huge privilege, and sometimes you have to do a cost-benefit analysis. I wouldn’t get fired for being fat, obviously, but would I get the same amount of professional respect? I don’t really want to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4azlnx00453b78harf1mkx@published" data-word-count="82"&gt;I’ve lumped this expense into the same category of self-maintenance that’s pretty normal, at least for women in my industry: Botox, covering up gray hair, manicures. I do all that stuff, too. It’s ironic, because the older and more experienced I get, the more money I make. I got a big promotion last year and I’m proud of that; I know I deserved it. But also, I have to spend more money to look the part. It’s ridiculous, and I resent it.&lt;/p&gt;

That wasn’t really an issue for me until I had kids. I had twins about four years ago, and it was hard for me to lose the baby weight. I had postpartum issues and I struggled a lot when my babies were little. I didn’t go back to work for two years. If I’m being honest, part of what kept me from wanting to go back was that I was still about 40 pounds heavier than I was before, and I was really insecure about it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4b0kbg004j3b78ytubsuxv@published" data-word-count="70"&gt;About two years ago, when Ozempic was getting a lot of attention, I figured I would try it. I was going through a divorce, and I really needed to go back to work, financially. I asked my doctor about it and he said he couldn’t prescribe them to me because I wasn’t prediabetic or obese. But then I figured out it was pretty easy to get a semaglutide prescription online.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4b0kbg004k3b7850wnm1va@published" data-word-count="95"&gt;It really did work. I lost most of the weight within six months. Now I take a lower dose to maintain. When I was taking a higher dose, I always had to plan around what I was doing that week — if I was going out to dinner with clients, for instance, I wouldn’t take it the day before. I learned that the hard way. The first six months, I spent a lot of time in the bathroom. I also &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/glp-1-hair-loss-causes-and-treatments.html"&gt;experienced a lot of hair loss&lt;/a&gt;. It’s mostly grown back, but not the way it was.&lt;/p&gt;

I thought it would make me feel better, mentally, because I’d been so depressed about my weight. But if anything, it was the opposite. I felt even more lethargic and just kind of blah all the time, but I couldn’t put my finger on why. I wound up going on an antidepressant, which helped. But now I’m trapped in this cycle where I have to keep taking these medications just to maintain. It feels fake. Like, where do I get off here? Do I just have to keep doing this until I retire?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4b0kbh004m3b78lmnup2dt@published" data-word-count="44"&gt;At the same time, everyone in my industry is taking it now too. It’s created this new playing field, and if I want to stay competitive, I need to keep up. No one talks about it, at least to me, but it’s pretty obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4b0kbh004n3b78tyqhgm3m@published" data-word-count="58"&gt;Financially, it’s not cheap. I spend about $500 a month on it, which is a lot less than I used to. I get the vials instead of the prefilled pens, which saves money, and I take a lower dosage. But I’m making good money in my career right now, so I tell myself it kind of shakes out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4b0kbh004o3b78am7j1e7k@published" data-word-count="46"&gt;I don’t like that my weight affects me so much. I wish it didn’t. But it does. And if I’m going to provide for my family and advance professionally, I need to keep it in check. I’m trying not to overthink it too much right now.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4ayoyd00323b78hypuls5m@published" data-word-count="8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Andrew, 38, interior designer based in New York&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4ayrpb003i3b7893mqc186@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;I have always carried more weight than I wanted to, and probably more than was healthy. And when I have gone to various extreme measures to lose weight, through restrictive eating or tons of working out, I’m miserable. When I’m not restricting myself, I feel generally healthier in the head. So when these new weight-loss medications became available, it seemed like something worth trying.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4b1j08004z3b78ohcobfu0@published" data-word-count="136"&gt;I’m not a newscaster or a model or anything, but as an interior designer, aesthetics are your whole business. I do a lot of interfacing with clients, and it’s important that I look a certain way. Also, in our end of the market, we run around with the &lt;em&gt;Über-&lt;/em&gt;wealthy, and obviously there is a huge emphasis on appearance and looks and weight in this realm of the world. Finally, in this era, you are supposed to present yourself and sell yourself as part of your product. It’s not just about your work — the face behind the design is part of your brand, so to speak. There are a lot of industry events, there’s a lot of photography. There’s social media. All of this puts pressure on men and women in the industry to look good.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4b1j0900503b78nhlp70mc@published" data-word-count="125"&gt;I first got the idea to try a GLP-1 through a friend. She was probably 50 pounds heavier than she wanted to be, and she was having a hard time losing the weight. She talked about wanting to try it, and it was so nice to have an open and nonjudgmental conversation about wanting to lose weight. So I talked to my doctor and he thought it was a good idea. I didn’t qualify for insurance to cover it, because I didn’t have a diabetes issue or anything. And I was not interested in trying to get a discount for fake reasons. I felt morally that was wrong, and I was happy to pay the full price. I’m privileged to be able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4b1j0a00513b78ywy4bya7@published" data-word-count="65"&gt;I ramped up the dosage gradually, but I did have a fair number of side effects. Mine were pretty much GI related. I’d never had motion sickness before in my life, but suddenly I had to take Zofran for it, which helped. Within about six months, I lost about 25, 30 pounds. So I decided to go off of it to see what would happen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh4b1j0a00523b78ifvdg8p3@published" data-word-count="108"&gt;I went off of it for six months, and in those six months, I never gained more than a couple of pounds. I wasn’t doing anything different. I was very, very aware of not depriving myself. So I was really just trying to roll with it. Then my weight did start to creep up, so I went back on it for a few months again. Now I sort of use it ad hoc. I’ll do it for a month and then take a month off, or I’ll stretch a month’s dose over two or three months. I see myself having it in my life for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

But $12,000 a year, in the grand scheme of living in Manhattan, isn’t unmanageable, especially if it makes a big positive impact.&lt;/p&gt;

But I definitely have a different sense of confidence in myself now than I did before. I put a lot of my life on social media, and it’s nice to feel good about how you look. Now my spouse is on it too. I’m open with everyone about it. I’ll say, “I’m on the shot.” The only people I wouldn’t tell are my parents. I think they would consider it lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

But RSV, the leading cause of infant hospitalization nationwide, presents particular risk for the youngest babies, a major reason health experts recommend pregnant women either get vaccinated near their delivery date or immunize their newborns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the perfect time to get your vaccine for RSV if you have never gotten one,” the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said in a statement to The Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RSV can spread through coughs or sneezes but also by &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/causes/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;touching&lt;/a&gt; a contaminated surface, such as a door handle, and then touching your face before washing your hands, health officials warn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the week ending Oct. 11, about 1.2% of emergency room visits nationwide among infants younger than 1 were due to RSV — up from 0.4% a month earlier, according to data &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.pophive.org/respiratory-diseases/respiratory-syncytial-virus#viral-activity-by-age" target="_blank"&gt;posted by PopHIVE&lt;/a&gt;, a project led by the Yale School of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An RSV wave is starting to take hold,” epidemiologists Katelyn Jetelina and Hannah Totte wrote in the &lt;a class="link" href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/rsv-season-measles-snap-benefits-jetelina-the-dose?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;amp;publication_id=281219&amp;amp;post_id=177224248&amp;amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;amp;isFreemail=true&amp;amp;r=5mkemj&amp;amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; Your Local Epidemiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RSV can be dangerous for infants, older adults and people with certain medical conditions, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RSV can cause pneumonia, as well as a severe inflammation of the lungs’ small airways, known as bronchiolitis, the California Department of Public Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, about 2% to 3% of young infants will be &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7241e1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;hospitalized&lt;/a&gt; for RSV &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/infants-young-children/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;annually&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC. Most children who are hospitalized for acute respiratory disease caused by RSV were previously healthy, according to a study published by the journal &lt;a class="link" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/132/2/e341/31332/Respiratory-Syncytial-Virus-Associated?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They may require oxygen or intravenous fluid or even be put on a ventilator to help them breathe, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the flu and COVID-19, there are no antiviral drugs to treat RSV once infection sets in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the combined &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/RespiratoryVirusReport.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;activity&lt;/a&gt; of respiratory illness from RSV, flu and COVID-19 is considered “very low” in California, state health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But “we are starting to see the beginnings of respiratory virus season,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials in Santa Clara County, Northern California’s most populous, are already reporting “medium” levels of RSV in the wastewater of San José, Palo Alto and Sunnyvale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now is exactly the time to get vaccinated if you haven’t already — “especially before respiratory virus activity potentially increases later,” said Dr. Regina Chinsio-Kwong, the Orange County health officer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RSV immunizations are recommended for pregnant women between 32 and 36 weeks of gestational age — about  one to two months before their estimated delivery date — as well as for everyone age 75 and up and those age 50 to 74 with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, cancer, kidney disease, weakened immune systems, asthma or heart disease. Vaccines are also recommended for individuals who live in a nursing home or long-term-care facility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a pregnant woman wasn’t vaccinated against RSV, officials recommend her infant get immunized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RSV vaccinations are fairly new, being introduced in 2023. There are now three &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7332e1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;brands&lt;/a&gt; — Moderna’s mResvia, Pfizer’s Abrysvo and GSK’s Arexvy. All three can be used for older adults, but only the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/hcp/vaccine-clinical-guidance/pregnant-people.html" target="_blank"&gt;Pfizer vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is available for pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infants were also able to get &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-09-06/rsv-season-may-have-already-begun-cdc-warns"&gt;immunized&lt;/a&gt; starting that year through monoclonal antibodies, which aren’t technically vaccines but function similarly in this case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults who already received an RSV vaccination generally don’t need to get another one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrival of those vaccines followed a particularly brutal 2022-23 respiratory virus season when California was slammed by a hospital-straining “tripledemic” of RSV, flu and COVID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the RSV shots, flu and COVID vaccinations are generally recommended ahead of every fall-and-winter virus respiratory season. Older adults, those age 65 and up, can get the COVID vaccination every six months, according to the California Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can get the RSV, flu and COVID vaccinations all during the same visit to a healthcare provider, Chinsio-Kwong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Receiving all eligible vaccines at once is considered best practice, as it helps avoid missed opportunities due to scheduling challenges,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annual routine flu vaccines are recommended for everyone who is at least 6 months old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for COVID, a vaccine can be given to anyone who wants one. The California Department of Public Health specifically &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/publichealth4all/vaccines.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; the shots for everyone age 65 and up, babies age 6 months to 23 months, children and teenagers who have never been vaccinated, and people with certain health risk factors and those in close contact with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health also recommends pregnant women get the COVID vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After concerns earlier this season about how difficult it might be to get COVID vaccinations, pharmacists and California health officials now say securing the shots is relatively easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controversy arose in the late summer amid confusing guidance coming from agencies overseen by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has disparaged vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a period during which the Food and Drug Administration had belatedly approved COVID-19 vaccines only for those age 65 and up and younger people with underlying health conditions. An unprecedented delay in the CDC issuing its own recommendations had the effect of snarling vaccinations for many. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some states, that meant people were being turned away from getting the COVID vaccine at their local pharmacy, including seniors, even as a late summer surge was raging. And at one point, the powerful CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-09-19/cdc-committee-votes-on-covid-19"&gt;nearly&lt;/a&gt; recommended the COVID vaccine be available by prescription only. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 6, acting CDC Director Jim O’Neill officially lifted the agency’s recommendation that adults under age 65 get the updated COVID-19 vaccine, saying instead that doing so should be based on “individual-based decision-making” in consultation with health professionals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, “patients can go into the pharmacy” and can have conversations on whether to get the COVID-19 vaccine with a professional, Allison Hill, a director of professional affairs for the American Pharmacists Assn., said during a recent webinar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California also recently clarified state law to make sure that pharmacists can independently administer the COVID vaccination, according to Dr. Erica Pan, director of the state Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi3wFBVV95cUxPQXVoRWFsU3doRmtLanBxaXhWS2ZpLVZRMzNWMmtmb3ZPYzNWcE1ZZEo2Y3lNU1hhUlAxQllUQ0JYLVFieHVRSzlnUXF5R3FraG5DN1hxSVNHbk80TXItdWVoSGc4WDQ0R2dXanhxdFhmRkNldUJOaUpELUgtYmQ3NWd5R2FnOWtpRVJ2TXdDSUJfaVlWM3dBUFZTMGxLZEplWDlFa1hsbDVERWtjaHVyWndpakhoQjQ4Qjhlbk1memhTeU90dHhyN0w0Rkp1dHZtT1R2M1JPbFRNN1AxN2FF</guid></item><item><title>科罗拉多州医生因踝关节手术和住院而支付了$ 64,000的账单-科罗拉多太阳报</title><link>https://coloradosun.com/2025/10/30/colorado-doctor-tripped-up-by-64k-bill-for-ankle-surgery-and-hospital-stay/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

		
		
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Julie Appleby&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-drop-cap"&gt;Physician Lauren Hughes was heading to see patients at a clinic about 20 miles from her Denver home in February when another driver T-boned her Subaru, totaling it. She was taken by ambulance to the closest hospital, Platte Valley Hospital.&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A shaken Hughes was examined in the emergency room, where she was diagnosed with bruising, a deep cut on her knee, and a broken ankle. Physicians recommended immediate surgical repair, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They said: ‘You have this fracture and a big gaping wound in your knee. We need to take you to the OR to wash it out and make sure there’s no infection,’” she said. “As a clinician, I thought, ‘Yes.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was taken to the operating room in the early evening, then admitted to the hospital overnight.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A friend took her home the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the bills came.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-medical-procedure"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Medical Procedure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surgeons cleaned the cut on her right knee, which had hit her car’s dashboard, and realigned a broken bone in her right ankle, stabilizing it with metal screws. Surgery is typically recommended when a broken bone is deemed unlikely to heal properly with only a cast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-final-bill"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Final Bill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$63,976.35, charged by the hospital — which was not in-network with the insurance plan she got through her job — for the surgery and overnight stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-documentcloud wp-block-embed-documentcloud"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-problem-should-i-stay-or-should-i-go"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Problem: Should I Stay or Should I Go?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hughes’ insurer, Anthem, fully covered the nearly $2,400 ambulance ride and some smaller radiology charges from the ER but denied the surgery and overnight stay charges from the out-of-network hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sixty-three thousand dollars for a broken ankle and a cut to the knee, with no head injury or internal damage,” Hughes said. “Just to stay there overnight. It’s crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Insurers have broad power to determine &lt;a href="https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/consumer-health-insurance-what-is-medical-necessity.pdf"&gt;whether care is medically necessary&lt;/a&gt; — that is, what is needed for treatment, diagnosis, or relief. And that decision affects whether and how much they will pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four days after her surgery, Anthem notified Hughes that after consulting clinical guidelines for her type of ankle repair, its reviewer determined it was not medically necessary for her to be fully admitted for an inpatient hospital stay.&lt;/p&gt;

(Rachel Woolf for KFF Health News)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If she had needed additional surgery or had other problems, such as vomiting or a fever, an inpatient stay might have been warranted, according to the letter. “The information we have does not show you have these or other severe problems,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Hughes, the notion that she should have left the hospital was “ludicrous.” Her car was in a junkyard, she had no family nearby, and she was taking opioid painkillers for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she asked for further details about medical necessity determinations, Hughes was directed deep inside her policy’s benefit booklet, which outlines that, for a hospital stay, documentation must show “safe and adequate care could not be obtained as an outpatient.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out the surgery charges were denied because of an insurance contract quirk. Under Anthem’s agreement with the hospital, all claims for services before and after a patient is admitted are approved or denied together, said Anthem spokesperson Emily Snooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hospital stay is not generally required after ankle surgery, and the insurer found Hughes did not need the kind of “comprehensive, complex medical care” that would necessitate hospitalization, Snooks wrote in an email to KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Anthem has consistently agreed that Ms. Hughes’ ankle surgery was medically necessary,” Snooks wrote. “However, because the ankle surgery was bundled with the inpatient admission, the entire claim was denied.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Facing bills from an out-of-network hospital where she was taken by emergency responders, though, Hughes did not understand why she wasn’t shielded by the &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/no-surprises-understand-your-rights-against-surprise-medical-bills"&gt;No Surprises Act&lt;/a&gt;, which took effect in 2022. The federal law requires insurers to cover out-of-network providers as though they are in-network when patients receive emergency care, among other protections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If they had determined it was medically necessary, then they would have to apply the No Surprises Act cost,” said Matthew Fiedler, a senior fellow with the Center on Health Policy at Brookings. “But the No Surprises Act is not going to override the normal medical necessity determination.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one more oddity in her case. During one of many calls Hughes made trying to sort out her bill, an Anthem representative told her that things might have been different had the hospital billed for her hospitalization as an overnight “observation” stay.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Generally, that’s when patients are kept at a facility so staff can determine whether they need to be admitted. Rather than being tied to the stay’s duration, the designation mainly reflects the intensity of care. A patient with fewer needs is more likely to be billed for an observation stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insurers pay hospitals less for an observation stay than admission, Fiedler said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That distinction is a big issue for patients on Medicare. Most often, the government health program will not pay for &lt;a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/skilled-nursing-facility-care#:~:text=You%20may%20not,for%20more%20information."&gt;any care needed in a nursing home&lt;/a&gt; if the patient was not first formally admitted to a &lt;a href="https://www.appliedpolicy.com/11-years-of-the-two-midnight-rule-how-a-controversial-policy-is-shaping-medicare-and-hospital-admissions-in-2024/#:~:text=The%20length%20of,patient%E2%80%99s%20financial%20responsibility."&gt;hospital for at least three days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a classic battle between providers and insurers as to what bucket a claim falls in,” Fiedler said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-resolution"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Resolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a physician and a director of a health policy center at the University of Colorado, Hughes is a savvier-than-usual policyholder. Yet even she was frustrated during the months spent going back and forth with her insurer and the hospital — and worried when it looked like her account would be sent to a collection agency.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In addition to appealing the denied claims, she sought the help of her employer’s human resources department, which contacted Anthem. She also &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/send-us-your-medical-bills/"&gt;reached out to KFF Health News&lt;/a&gt;, which contacted Anthem and the Platte Valley Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late September, Hughes received calls from a hospital official, who told her they had “downgraded the level of care” the hospital billed her insurance for and resubmitted the claim to Anthem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a written statement to KFF Health News, Platte Valley Hospital spokesperson Sara Quale said that the facility “deeply regrets any anxiety this situation has caused her.” The hospital had “prematurely” and erroneously sent Hughes a bill before working out the balance with Anthem, she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“After a careful review of Ms. Hughes’ situation,” Quale continued, “we have now stopped all billing to her. Furthermore, we have informed Ms. Hughes that if her insurance company ultimately assigns the remaining balance to her, she will not be billed for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthem spokesperson Stephanie DuBois said in an email that Platte Valley resubmitted Hughes’ bill to the insurer on Oct. 3, this time for “outpatient care services.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An explanation of benefits that was sent to Hughes shows the hospital rebilled for around $61,000 — about $40,000 of which was knocked off the total by an Anthem discount. The insurer paid the hospital nearly $21,000.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the end, Hughes owed only a $250 copayment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-takeaway"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are places where patients receiving emergency care at an out-of-network hospital may fall through the cracks of federal billing protections, in particular during a phase that may be nearly indistinguishable to the patient, known as “post-stabilization.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, that occurs when the medical provider determines the patient is &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/medical-bill-rights/know-your-rights/using-insurance#notice-and-consent-poststabilization"&gt;stable enough to travel&lt;/a&gt; to an in-network facility using nonmedical transport, said Jack Hoadley, a research professor emeritus at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the patient prefers to stay put for further treatment, the out-of-network provider must then ask the patient &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/medical-bill-rights/know-your-rights/using-insurance#notice-and-consent-poststabilization"&gt;to sign a consent form&lt;/a&gt;, agreeing to waive billing protections and continue treatment at out-of-network rates, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s very important that if they give you some kind of letter to sign that you read that letter very carefully, because that letter might give them your permission to get some big bills,” Hoadley said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If possible, patients should contact their insurer, in addition to asking the hospital’s billing department: Are you being fully admitted, or kept under observation status, and why? Has your care been determined to be medically necessary? Keep in mind that medical necessity determinations play a key role in whether coverage is approved or denied, even after services are provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, Hughes did not recall being told she was stable enough to leave with nonmedical transportation, nor being asked to sign a consent form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her advice is to quickly and aggressively question insurance denials once they are received, including by asking for your case to be escalated to the insurer’s and hospital’s leadership. She said expecting patients to navigate complicated billing questions while in the hospital after a serious injury isn’t realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was calling family,” Hughes said, “alerting my work colleagues about what happened, processing the extent of my injuries and what needed to be done clinically, arranging care for my pet, getting labs and imaging done — coming to grips with what just happened.”&lt;/p&gt;

Now, scientists have discovered that this traditional plant may hold remarkable healing potential. Researchers from &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.omu.ac.jp/en/info/research-news/entry-94570.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Osaka Metropolitan University in Japan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have found that compounds extracted from henna (Lawsonia inermis) could help treat liver fibrosis, a dangerous condition caused by the build-up of scar tissue in the liver. This scarring, often linked to alcohol abuse or fatty liver disease, can lead to liver failure or cancer if untreated. The discovery marks a major step toward developing a natural, plant-based therapy that may not only halt but possibly reverse liver damage, offering new hope to millions suffering from chronic liver diseases worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Henna dye reveals its potential to reverse fibrosis&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liver fibrosis is the result of long-term injury or inflammation of the liver. When the liver becomes damaged from excessive alcohol use, fatty liver disease, or viral infections such as hepatitis, it tries to heal itself. However, this repeated healing process often leads to the production of fibrous scar tissue, which gradually replaces healthy liver cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 easy exercises that improve liver health within a month&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, this scarring reduces the liver’s ability to function properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If left untreated, fibrosis can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts estimate that 3–4 per cent of the world’s population suffers from advanced liver fibrosis. Despite its prevalence, current medical treatments mainly focus on controlling the underlying cause rather than reversing the scarring itself. This is why the new findings from Osaka are being seen as potentially revolutionary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Osaka study reveals henna’s power against fibrosis&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team at Osaka Metropolitan University developed a chemical screening system capable of identifying substances that can directly target hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) — specialised liver cells responsible for maintaining structural integrity. Under normal conditions, HSCs help with tissue repair and vitamin A storage. However, when overactivated by chronic liver injury, they begin producing collagen excessively, leading to fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this advanced system, scientists discovered that Lawsone, the primary pigment in henna can inhibit the activation of these cells. This means that the compound can potentially halt or reverse the fibrotic process at its root.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How the henna compound worked in laboratory trials&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their hypothesis, researchers administered Lawsone to mice with induced liver fibrosis. The results were striking. The treated mice showed a reduction in major fibrosis markers, including YAP, αSMA, and COL1A proteins known to indicate the severity of liver scarring. Additionally, the researchers observed a rise in cytoglobin, a protein linked to antioxidant activity in hepatic stellate cells. This suggested that the cells were returning to their normal, healthy state, rather than remaining in their activated, fibrogenic form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in the scientific journal Biomedicine &amp;amp; Pharmacotherapy, point to the potential reversal of liver fibrosis something modern medicine has so far been unable to achieve effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Osaka study advances henna’s potential as a liver-healing drug&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Atsuko Daikoku from Osaka Metropolitan University’s Graduate School of Medicine, the next stage of research involves developing a drug delivery system that can transport Lawsone directly to activated hepatic stellate cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are currently working on a system capable of delivering these drugs precisely to the affected cells,” Dr Daikoku explained. “By controlling fibroblast activity, including HSCs, we could potentially limit or even reverse the effects of fibrosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If successful, this could lead to the first treatment that not only halts fibrosis but also repairs the liver, giving patients a chance at complete recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the causes of liver fibrosis&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibrosis is not a disease in itself but a response to ongoing liver injury. The main causes include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): A growing global health issue linked to obesity, diabetes, and poor diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alcoholic liver disease: Caused by years of excessive alcohol consumption, which inflames and damages liver cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Viral hepatitis (B and C): Long-term infections that continuously injure the liver.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Autoimmune hepatitis and iron overload: Conditions that cause inflammation or metabolic imbalance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Biliary obstruction: Blocked bile ducts that lead to liver inflammation and scarring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all these cases, the body’s natural healing process turns against itself — producing too much scar tissue and reducing liver efficiency over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Liver fibrosis symptoms&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges in treating liver fibrosis is that it develops silently. In its early stages, there are often no noticeable symptoms, making diagnosis difficult until the disease has progressed significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the liver becomes more scarred, symptoms may start to appear, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent fatigue and weakness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea or digestive discomfort&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jaundice — yellowing of the skin and eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fluid build-up in the legs or abdomen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty concentrating or mental confusion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time these warning signs emerge, liver function is often severely impaired, underscoring the urgent need for treatments that can repair existing damage such as those being developed from henna-derived compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Could henna revolutionise liver disease treatment&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If further studies confirm the effectiveness of Lawsone, it could mark the beginning of a new era in liver disease treatment. Unlike current therapies that focus only on prevention or symptom management, Lawsone-based drugs could actually reverse the damage, allowing the liver to heal. Moreover, this research highlights how traditional plant-based remedies can be re-evaluated through modern science. What was once used purely for cosmetic and cultural purposes could soon serve as a lifesaving medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As clinical testing progresses, the possibility of using natural henna compounds to regenerate liver tissue offers hope to millions of patients worldwide battling chronic liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/are-humans-in-danger-the-lancet-report-reveals-how-rising-heat-and-pollution-are-killing-millions-worldwide/articleshow/124897792.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Are humans in danger?

Berries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research on berries is so exciting, both for breast cancer prevention and for survivors,” says Dr Mussallem. “For every two servings a week, they can reduce the risk of &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/breast-cancer" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="breast cancer"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and for survivors, lower the risk of dying from it by 25%.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Purple sweet potatoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These purple sweet potatoes have about 150% more anthocyanins than berries,” she explains. “These powerful compounds help turn off tumour genes and activate tumour suppressor genes, essentially putting the brakes on cancer growth.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="embed_div"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Cruciferous vegetables (like broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are some of the most powerful vegetables when it comes to breast cancer,” Dr Mussallem says. “They contain an enzyme called myrosinase, which helps the body absorb their cancer-fighting nutrients more effectively. They also help transform estrogen into a form that doesn’t stimulate cell growth.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Beans and other fibre-rich plant foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an amazing plant protein and you’re not just getting protein, you’re getting fibre,” she notes. “A massive study with 17 million person-years of data showed that fibre can reduce the risk of dying from any cause, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/heart-disease" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="heart disease"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, and even pancreatic cancer. Another review found that fibre can cut overall cancer risk by 22%.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/10/30/original/Screenshot_2025-10-30_095639_1761798399163.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="According to Dr. Mussallem, certain foods such as soy and berries can significantly reduce cancer risks.(Google Gemini)" title="According to Dr. Mussallem, certain foods such as soy and berries can significantly reduce cancer risks.(Google Gemini)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;According to Dr. Mussallem, certain foods such as soy and berries can significantly reduce cancer risks.(Google Gemini)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Soy and edamame&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are very few foods that, if you ever got breast cancer, can actually reduce your risk of dying, and edamame is one of them,” says Dr Mussallem. “Soy is also protective for the prostate and may reduce the risk of lung cancer.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amaranth is a whole grain with a nutty flavor that works in sweet and savory dishes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is packed with protein and fiber, contains magnesium and iron and is gluten-free. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try adding amaranth to a salad, energy bites, porridge or as a thickener for soups and stews. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If this is the first you’ve heard of amaranth, you may be surprised to learn that it has been around for thousands of years. Native to the Americas, amaranth was cultivated and consumed by the Aztec, Maya and Inca civilizations.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Like quinoa, this ancient whole grain is often classified as a “pseudocereal” because it is a seed from a different plant species than traditional cereal grains like oats and barley. Yet, amaranth is prepared and eaten in the same way as common whole-grain cereals. Amaranth has a pleasant nutty flavor and thick consistency, making it ideal for sweet or savory porridges alike.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although the word “whole” in whole grains means that all parts of the grain are left complete and intact, it also represents their well-rounded and robust nutrient content. In other words, a lot of goodness is packaged in the tiny morsels of whole grains. In addition to their carb content, some other nutrients include vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and disease-fighting phytochemicals. Not to mention, some whole grains are packed with protein. And amaranth is a high-protein whole grain I love over the others. Let’s dive in.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-i-love-amaranth"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Why I Love Amaranth &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Loaded with Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Amaranth is my go-to whole grain because it’s a plant-based protein powerhouse! One cup of cooked amaranth boasts an impressive 9 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Unlike most grains, amaranth is a complete protein with a balanced composition of all nine essential amino acids, which are needed in sufficient amounts to build muscle, hormones, neurotransmitters and immune-supporting antibodies. But that’s not all. One study highlighted that amaranth seeds contain a protein peptide similar to lunasin, found in soybeans and known for helping prevent certain types of cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It's Full of Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I don’t know what I would do without whole grains. From the comfort and fullness they provide to their deliciousness, keeping a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031247/healthy-whole-grains-to-eat-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;variety of whole grains&lt;/a&gt; stocked in my pantry is nonnegotiable. Whole grains are not only a source of carbohydrates needed to fuel our body, they deliver so much more than that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the benefits of eating more whole grains is that the fiber isn’t stripped away like in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047875/what-are-refined-carbs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;their refined-grain counterparts&lt;/a&gt;. Fiber is a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;necessary nutrient&lt;/a&gt; that helps stabilize blood sugar levels, support digestive health and lower cholesterol levels. To reap these benefits, I aim for the recommendation to consume 25 grams of fiber daily.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; By eating a half-cup of amaranth, I get 4 grams of dietary fiber—16% of the recommended intake.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It's a Great Source of Iron &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a mom and dietitian, my top priority is to ensure my family gets all the iron they need. Iron is a critical mineral for our red blood cells, allowing them to transport oxygen throughout our body. While meat is one of the most widely known sources of iron, plant-based foods, including amaranth, can also provide it. That’s why amaranth was one of the first whole grains I introduced to my little one. One cup of amaranth contains 5 milligrams of iron, which is 45% of the recommended intake for a 6-month-old baby (comparable to what fortified baby cereals contain!). That said, dietary iron comes in two forms: heme and nonheme, and our body can better absorb the former, found in animal-based foods. Yet, pairing plant-based foods, which deliver nonheme iron, with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2052728/6-foods-with-more-vitamin-c-than-an-orange/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin C-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; like strawberries helps increase its absorption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It's High in Magnesium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Minerals like magnesium may quickly become depleted due to high-stress levels and vice versa.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Still, my body &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-8656021" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;needs magnesium&lt;/a&gt; to perform essential functions like protein production, muscle and nerve function, blood pressure regulation and more. On those days when I feel more stressed than usual, I try to boost my magnesium intake. Fortunately, amaranth contains 160 mg of magnesium per cooked cup, a remarkable 38% of the Daily Value for the mineral.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It's Gluten-Free &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At this point, is there anything that amaranth doesn’t contain? Actually, there is! Amaranth is one of the few &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/288100/gluten-free-foods-list/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gluten-free whole grains&lt;/a&gt;. Along with quinoa, buckwheat, teff, corn and rice, amaranth is an excellent option for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-enjoy-amaranth"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How to Enjoy Amaranth &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Amaranth is a versatile little grain that can be used in a variety of dishes. But before I whip up a pot of amaranth, I ensure I soak the whole grain overnight. Soaking whole grains improves digestion and enhances the body’s ability to absorb the key nutrients mentioned above.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once soaked, my favorite way to prepare amaranth is to toss it into a pot of boiling water to create a delicious porridge. Topped with berries, sweetened with a touch of maple syrup and drizzled with almond butter, amaranth porridge has become a nutrient-dense staple in my household. I often describe the texture as a marriage between oatmeal and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seeds-benefits-11705262" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chia pudding&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But if porridge isn’t your jam, you can also grind amaranth into a fine powder and use it to make protein-packed pancakes or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/270874/gluten-free-morning-glory-blender-muffins/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;muffins&lt;/a&gt;. You can even pop amaranth over dry heat to add to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/249791/maple-nut-granola/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;homemade granola&lt;/a&gt;. But if you’re looking for something a bit more savory, amaranth also makes for a great thickener in soups, stews and chili. The options are truly endless!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fun fact: Popped amaranth is traditionally used in Mexico to make honey- or agave-sweetened candies shaped into skulls to celebrate Dia de los Muertos.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although I like to rotate whole grains to make sure I eat different plant-based foods every week, I love eating amaranth more regularly. This high-protein whole grain is chock-full of nutrients and very versatile to use. Prepared as porridge or cooked into pancakes, amaranth is an excellent gluten-free option if you are looking to switch up your typical whole-grain intake.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

It’s now not quite zero, but is certainly greatly reduced, which is a huge relief for a woman who has seen breast cancer blaze through both sides of her family, affecting young female relatives on her mom’s side and an older male relative on her dad’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Her mom, Michelle Hall, was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer when Anna was 5. Her mom was 33 at the time, and after undergoing radiation and chemotherapy, she was in remission for a year, then the cancer came back and she was told it was not survivable. When Anna was 9, her mother died. Michelle Hall was 37 years old and her husband Jim raised their two young daughters, later with the help of their stepmother after he remarried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="785" data-height="1024"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/JFMH3KL4GJFAFKMMQHOMLQ476Q.jpeg?auth=79f9402670922b4ba7f19f86fdfccfa743964c0194eb19e5548a5906af9fd388&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=1043" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/JFMH3KL4GJFAFKMMQHOMLQ476Q.jpeg?auth=79f9402670922b4ba7f19f86fdfccfa743964c0194eb19e5548a5906af9fd388&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=2086 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Michelle Hall with her daughter Anna in an old family photo.

Anna Hall can name other relatives who’ve been diagnosed with breast cancer and others who have died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It’s been a looming shadow, she said. “I always grew up with a fear of it.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Among her childhood memories are watching her vibrant mom become terribly ill and weak, unable to do things with the husband and daughters she adored. Hall said she has always known she would reduce her own risk surgically if she’d inherited the danger. Once she learned she had, the question was when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She was far less afraid of the surgery and recovery than she was of putting it off. But while she has been proactive in facing the risk, she’s also been busy launching a career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="A-lifetime-of-vigilance" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;A lifetime of vigilance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/ZLXR7ATZBBBAVH3E7PXH4Z2RJY.JPG?auth=0ae137b93d32fdb4acfc0816f7389fef90ccc5fde96f7046c4ec0a92487f00a5&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/ZLXR7ATZBBBAVH3E7PXH4Z2RJY.JPG?auth=0ae137b93d32fdb4acfc0816f7389fef90ccc5fde96f7046c4ec0a92487f00a5&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;An old family photo featuring Anna Hall, right, her biological mother, Michelle, and her little sister, Kirsten, is displayed at her family's home in Draper on Wednesday, Oct. 22, 2025. Hall has a BRCA1 gene mutation, which can cause breast cancer, and has a family history of breast cancer with multiple deaths, including her biological mother; because of those factors, she decided to have a double mastectomy in August. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Isaac Hale, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The National Cancer Institute reports that “the risks of developing breast and ovarian cancer are markedly increased in people who inherit a harmful change in BRCA1 or BRCA2,” two genes with mutations closely tied to breast cancer risk. BRCA literally stands for “BReast CAncer gene.” Those with a mutation have increased risk of some other cancers, too, but that risk is less than for breast and ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Those with a “harmful change” in either BRCA gene “also tend to develop cancer at younger ages than people who do not have such a variant,” per the institute. The fact a person usually has only one copy of the gene with the variant is a good thing, but its protective benefits can be lost over the course of a lifetime, so risk of cancer is “markedly greater” than among those without any BRCA variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The institute reports that more than 60% of women who inherit a harmful variant in BRCA1 or BRCA2 will develop breast cancer at some point. The risk for women in the general population is about 13%. And for those who develop breast cancer in one breast, the risk is significant for later breast cancer in the other breast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The risk of breast cancer from a BRCA mutation is much less for men, at between 0.2% and 7.1% by age 70, but it happens. And it happened in the Hall family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;So Hall got tested when she was 22 to see if she had inherited a BRCA mutation. She was attending Utah State University at the time and had the blood test done. She learned that she had inherited a BRCA 1 mutation. Because of her family history and her status as BRCA positive, as well as her breast tissue density, she and a specialist developed a vigilant monitoring plan. Dense breast tissue can make it hard to spot breast cancer and may also increase its risk. The doctor recommended a breast MRI every year and ultrasounds as needed “until I decided what I wanted to do,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“I always knew, once I found out I had a mutation, that at some point I would want a prophylactic double mastectomy,” Hall said. “No one who had breast cancer in my family survived. So I was waiting for the right time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Doctors told her that before age 30 would be best, since her mom was diagnosed so young. If she decided to have a preventive surgery, that would be the best time to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Not-a-tough-decision" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Not a tough decision&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/P3SBTEGH2JE45KLPIUE6FLYTOU.JPG?auth=152f6c51fe5aead41524eab240175002c4fee32a7d71f51dd1c5d04766969520&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/P3SBTEGH2JE45KLPIUE6FLYTOU.JPG?auth=152f6c51fe5aead41524eab240175002c4fee32a7d71f51dd1c5d04766969520&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Anna Hall poses for a portrait at her family's home in Draper on Wednesday, Oct. 22, 2025. Hall has a BRCA1 gene mutation, which can cause breast cancer, and has a family history of breast cancer with multiple deaths, including her biological mother; because of those factors, she decided to have a double mastectomy in August. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Isaac Hale, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;While she worried some, she was also busy living, so timing mattered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Hall was attending law school at the University of Utah, and put off surgery to make sure she was well covered by health insurance. She graduated last year and got a job as an attorney. This year, she felt like it would all work out, so she had the double mastectomy and began the reconstruction process. She’ll have a second surgery at the beginning of next year to get implants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She had almost a month off from work to recover and said she is doing well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She’s very open about the surgery because she knows that some women may be hesitant if faced with the same choice. She benefited from others telling her their story and hopes her story will be helpful, too. She said that she’s thrilled to let go of the cancer fear and she knows that’s what her mother would have wanted for her. She also thinks she’s not the only one in her extended family that has made this choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“I know that some women struggle with the fact that breast tissue is no longer there,” Hall said. “I haven’t felt that struggle. My family never focused on our bodies or how we looked at all. It was about being healthy. I think that helped me in this situation. All my friends and family are incredibly supportive. Everybody really, even at work. Take the time you need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;And she certainly doesn’t miss the constant worry. “A couple of years ago, I found a lump. The biopsy came back that it was benign. When I found the lump, before I got the biopsy, I broke down. I was crying, upset. How do I finish law school? What do I do?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Hall decided then that she would reduce her risk the first chance she got. And she did, after doing research to find the right surgeon and plastic surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Online support was huge, as well. She found a group on Instagram called “The Breasties,” made up of others who were somehow connected to breast cancer and she asked them questions. She found other resources where she could ask questions and talk about her fears, including those of getting the surgery. One question: “Am I going to regret this?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The response was immediate and overwhelming: Women years out from a double mastectomy told her they’d never regretted their choice. She found an old classmate who’d faced the same choice and made the same decision. And she did a lot of online research and outreach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“One of the beautiful things about social media,” Hall said, is finding Instagram posts and videos from people she could message and ask questions. It also becomes a way to help others and be helped, not just with information and personal experience, but with tangible stuff. She had to wear surgical drains for a while after surgery and a woman shipped her a hoodie that was made for the purpose of hiding the drains. “It’s a beautiful community,” she said, with people sharing their stories to help others. She said she hopes to help others as she was helped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="A-busy-full-life" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;A busy, full life&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Hall is back to work and nearly back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;For her, that means time with family and friends. “I am very much a quality time person,” she said, noting she loves going to movies, shopping, taking a sisters’ trip to Disneyland. “I do think some of that comes from losing my mom and other family members at such a young age. I savor every moment I have with people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;When she’s not with others, she devours books and belongs to two book clubs. She laughs when people ask her favorite genre, because she’ll read almost anything. She credits her broad taste in and deep love of books to her dad’s mom, who was a librarian and gave her books every holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;If friends of family say they’re going hiking, she’s always game to go with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She loves people. And her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 03:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNc2hIX0FsM21iRjlteFZrbDNoRmc1Nm85b1hjLVFacXJPMFpoX2hxVXRFbFViWHhEOUlWaTV4aVNzcWRvZXJFTTBFcmlIa1o4R3EzOFp4al83OVY2OFpRUnpqZ0RjbFhzdVMyVmhGM2JLWDF4VV9CT1pkZFdiYUpCSkF0WmpmTTY3RHdIXzlYOTlUUlZUaTdrRFRNSFVkX25yUW1GRg</guid></item><item><title>数十年来，强大的新抗生素一直“隐藏在普通人的视线中” - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/powerful-new-antibiotic-was-hiding-in-plain-sight-for-decades</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Researchers have just identified a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/promising-new-antibiotics-could-be-hiding-in-our-gut-microbiomes"&gt;powerful new antibiotic&lt;/a&gt; – in a significant discovery made not by breaking new ground, but by revisiting familiar territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compound, pre-methylenomycin C lactone, was discovered by a team from Warwick University in the UK and Monash University in Australia. While it's never been spotted before, it comes from a type of bacteria that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/that-rAIn-smell-turns-out-we-re-smelling-the-circle-of-life"&gt;scientists have studied for decades&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potentially, it could help fight bacteria that have become &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ancient-killer-is-rapidly-becoming-resistant-to-antibiotics-warns-study"&gt;increasingly resistant&lt;/a&gt; to modern treatments – and it's actually an intermediate chemical that's created during the process of making another antibiotic, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenomycin_A"&gt;methylenomycin A&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/forgotten-antibiotic-from-decades-past-could-be-a-superbug-killer"&gt;Forgotten Antibiotic From Decades Past Could Be a Superbug Killer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Remarkably, the bacterium that makes methylenomycin A and pre-methylenomycin C lactone – &lt;em&gt;Streptomyces coelicolor&lt;/em&gt; – is a model antibiotic-producing species that's been studied extensively since the 1950s," &lt;a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/news/pressreleases/new_antibiotic_for_drug_resistant_bacteria_found_hiding_in_plain_sight"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; chemist Lona Alkhalaf, from the University of Warwick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Finding a new antibiotic in such a familiar organism was a real surprise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lab tests, pre-methylenomycin C lactone was shown to be 100 times more effective than methylenomycin A against &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram-positive_bacteria"&gt;Gram-positive bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, the kinds that are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-just-caught-bacteria-using-a-never-before-seen-trick-to-avoid-antibiotics"&gt;getting smarter&lt;/a&gt; at outwitting our current antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179467" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179467" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/AntibioticGraphic.jpg" alt="Antibiotic graphic" class="wp-image-179467 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/AntibioticGraphic.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/AntibioticGraphic-600x301.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179467" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Pre-methylenomycin C lactone was found to be much more potent than methylenomycin A. (Corre et al, &lt;em&gt;J. Am. Chem. Soc.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the discovery decided to take a closer look at methylenomycin A by modifying the genes used in the assembly line of the antibiotic, to see what each one did. The resulting compounds, described as biosynthetic intermediates, were then tested for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-dual-target-drug-could-make-antibiotic-resistance-100-million-times-harder"&gt;antibiotic activity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Methylenomycin A was originally discovered 50 years ago, and while it has been synthesized several times, no one appears to have tested the synthetic intermediates for antimicrobial activity," &lt;a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/news/pressreleases/new_antibiotic_for_drug_resistant_bacteria_found_hiding_in_plain_sight"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; chemist Greg Challis, from the University of Warwick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team discovered that pre-methylenomycin C lactone was effective against the bacteria responsible for both &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"&gt;Methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (MRSA) and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin-resistant_Enterococcus"&gt;Vancomycin-resistant &lt;em&gt;Enterococcus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (VRE), two of the infections proving most troublesome for existing antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's particularly promising is that &lt;em&gt;Enterococcus&lt;/em&gt; bacteria exposed to pre-methylenomycin C lactone for 28 days straight didn't become &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/simple-experiment-reveals-why-your-next-antibiotics-may-prove-useless"&gt;resistant to it&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting the compound could remain effective over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With experts increasingly worried about antibiotic resistance – already responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-third-leading-cause-of-death-globally-in-2019-was-antibiotic-resistant-bacterial-infection"&gt;millions of deaths&lt;/a&gt; each year – the need for new and resilient drugs to tackle infections is urgent, as bacteria &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-hidden-threat-looming-behind-antibiotic-resistance-is-now-emerging"&gt;continue to evolve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mixing-coffee-and-antibiotics-could-be-a-bad-idea-study-shows"&gt;Mixing Coffee And Antibiotics Could Be a Bad Idea, Study Shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we need more preclinical and lab testing for pre-methylenomycin C lactone to fully understand its potential as an antibiotic – both in the mechanisms through which it works and the pathogen targets that it hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also see potential in looking at the intermediates of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/game-changing-antibiotic-discovered-that-spares-good-bacteria"&gt;other antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; to see if there are more compounds like this to be found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This discovery suggests a new paradigm for antibiotic discovery," &lt;a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/news/pressreleases/new_antibiotic_for_drug_resistant_bacteria_found_hiding_in_plain_sight"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Challis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By identifying and testing intermediates in the pathways to diverse natural compounds, we may find potent new antibiotics with more resilience to resistance that will aid us in the fight against antimicrobial resistance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c12501"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A highly contagious disease once vanquished by vaccination is now on the brink of officially returning to North America. Canada is expected to lose its measles elimination status, and the U.S. might possibly soon follow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week, Canada &lt;a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/#a21"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; new cases of measles tied to an ongoing outbreak—one that began 12 months ago. The year of continuous transmission means that Canada will almost certainly lose its measles-free designation, experts say. And though the largest outbreaks of measles in the U.S. this year have officially ended, the country could potentially still lose its status in 2026, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As of today, it seems very, very likely that Canada will lose its measles elimination status, while the United States is also at substantial risk in the next 3 months,” Sten Vermund, chief medical officer at the &lt;a href="https://gvn.org/"&gt;Global Virus Network&lt;/a&gt;, a coalition of medical virologists focused on viral threats, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A resurgent enemy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite a highly effective vaccine for it, measles remains a serious public health threat across much of the globe. In 2023, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; to have sickened roughly 10 million people and killed over 100,000 worldwide, with most deaths occurring in unvaccinated children under five.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Some countries, through widespread vaccination programs, have kept measles largely at bay by stopping its local transmission. The U.S. officially eliminated endemic measles in 2000, while the Americas as a whole first achieved elimination in 2016. Canada earned its measles-free status in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;But so long as measles is endemic somewhere, the disease can hitch a ride on infected travelers and threaten to regain a foothold in locally eliminated countries, especially when vaccination rates start to decline. It’s a threat that’s now hitting close to home in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Canada’s latest outbreak first began in October 2024 in the province of New Brunswick. Since then, the country has reported over 5,000 cases, nearly all of which are linked to the initial New Brunswick cluster. And though the flow of cases has significantly slowed down over time, it hasn’t stopped. On Monday, Canadian health officials &lt;a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/#a21"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 19 new cases during the week of October 18 (the most current data) and 136 recent cases across five jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization regularly evaluates whether countries can be deemed locally free of measles. Travel-related outbreaks can and do still occur in these countries, but it takes more than a year of ongoing transmission for the WHO to even consider revoking a country’s measles-free card. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), a subset of the WHO, will meet next month for its annual assessment of the region’s status. And given the current situation, Canada will probably lose its measles-free mantle.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;What about the U.S.?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The immediate outlook is a bit less grim for the U.S., though still far from great.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier this January, a large outbreak of measles began in Western Texas. More than 700 cases were ultimately documented before officials formally declared the outbreak over in mid-August. Another large outbreak occurred around the same time nearby in New Mexico, which saw roughly 100 cases before it appeared to die down in late September.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trouble is, there have been many other measles clusters happening across the U.S. this year, and some are &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-ongoing-measles-outbreak-has-reached-a-new-peak-2000666729"&gt;ongoing&lt;/a&gt;. All told, there have been roughly 1,650 cases &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;—the largest tally seen since 1992—and dozens of outbreaks reported nationwide in 2025. At least three people died of measles in the U.S. this year as well, the first deaths recorded in a decade. There are current outbreaks in South Carolina, Illinois, Minnesota, Arizona, and Utah, with the latter two states &lt;a href="https://www.vaccineadvisor.com/news/measles-outbreak-spreads-beyond-utah-arizona-border-123-cases-reported/"&gt;sharing&lt;/a&gt; a cluster that’s now over 120 cases and counting.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Though the outbreak in Texas is over, it remains possible that health officials will link some of the current cases to it. This can occur if people in these states are found to be infected with the same or closely related strain of measles that sickened residents in Texas. If so, and if these cases last until January, the PAHO could very well decide to revoke the measles-free status of the U.S. early next year, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But even if this scenario doesn’t happen, experts are still worried about measles becoming endemic in America soon enough, given the sheer amount of transmission we’ve seen this year.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“I expect the US will lose its measles elimination status next year, as the U.S. in 2025 has already experienced almost 4 cases per 10 million, 87% of cases were related to an outbreak, i.e., not imported, and there have already been 43 outbreaks in less than one year,” Jessica Justman, an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The country’s federal public health system isn’t exactly in steady hands either. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump appointed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, a man with a &lt;a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/rfk-jr-vaccine-disinformation/"&gt;long history&lt;/a&gt; of misleading the public about the safety of vaccines, including the &lt;a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/fact-checking-presidential-candidate-robert-f-kennedy-jr-on-vaccines-autism-and-covid-19/#:~:text=Kennedy%20also%20played,them%20young%20children."&gt;combined&lt;/a&gt; measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. And during the height of the Texas outbreak, both he and &lt;a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/04/rfk-jr-measles-nonprofit-vaccine-safety/"&gt;his allies&lt;/a&gt; downplayed its impact and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-measles-cure-cod-liver-oil-and-a-whole-lot-of-other-nonsense-2000574321"&gt;touted&lt;/a&gt; unsupported treatments for the viral disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How to stop the return of measles&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Formidable as measles is, we’ve long known how to best curtail its danger: vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It might be too late to stop the official return of measles in Canada or even the U.S. But that doesn’t mean that all hope is lost. Notably, Canada wouldn’t even be the first country in the Americas to have lost this status in the last few years, as both Brazil and Venezuela did recently. However, these countries have since &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/news/12-11-2024-paho-re-verifies-brazil-measles-free-country"&gt;regained&lt;/a&gt; their designation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though America certainly has a growing anti-vaccination problem, measles vaccination rates in the U.S. and Canada remain generally high (for now). The current outbreaks have occurred in regions where rates are much lower than average, such as &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g8d39gdr0o"&gt;Mennonite communities&lt;/a&gt; in Canada. In at least some of these communities, officials have said, residents aren’t necessarily opposed to vaccination but simply have less regular contact with doctors. And unlike the U.S., there are no major public health figureheads in Canada with a track record of anti-vaccination sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of which is to say that a dedicated public health response can still convince people to get their measles shots. And Vermund expects that Canadian health officials will lay out a detailed plan to the PAHO to get things back on course.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;According to Vermund, this plan should ideally include, among other things, stronger vaccination campaigns that target under-vaccinated regions like Alberta and Ontario; mobile clinics and school-based immunization drives; community engagement and public education to counter vaccine misinformation; and improved surveillance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That same framework should also work to boost flagging vaccination rates in the U.S., too. But under the reign of RFK Jr., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/irreparably-damaged-former-senior-official-details-the-darkest-days-of-the-cdc-under-rfk-jr-2000673201"&gt;turned&lt;/a&gt; into a shadow of its former self, and the ongoing shutdown of the federal government might further hamper any assistance that the CDC can provide to local and state agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“A course correction for the U.S. will require an intensive vaccination campaign and funding to support the public health surveillance systems across all 50 states,” Justman said. “Neither of these seems likely in the current context.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though Canada will lose its status first, measles might have an easier time getting reestablished in its downstairs neighbor. If so, plenty more children and their families will suffer as a result.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

The flexible, low-cost device analyzes a drop of saliva in under three minutes, offering a fast, affordable, and noninvasive diagnostic tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because low BDNF levels are associated with depression and cognitive decline, the test could help clinicians detect and monitor disorders earlier. With an estimated cost of just $2.19 per unit, the biosensor could transform mental health screening, especially in low-resource settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Results:&lt;/strong&gt; The saliva-based biosensor measures BDNF levels in less than three minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affordable Innovation:&lt;/strong&gt; Each unit costs around $2.19, making it accessible for widespread use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; Low BDNF levels are linked to depression, while increases can track recovery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;FAPESP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brazilian researchers have developed a low-cost, portable biosensor that can quickly identify a protein whose altered levels are associated with psychiatric disorders, such as depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it becomes commercially available in the future, it may contribute to early detection, which is essential for treating and monitoring patients’ clinical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113641"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/depression-sensor-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/depression-sensor-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/depression-sensor-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/depression-sensor-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/depression-sensor-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/depression-sensor-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/depression-sensor-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/depression-sensor-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a cell phone, neurons and a sensor." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/depression-sensor-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/depression-sensor-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/depression-sensor-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/depression-sensor-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/depression-sensor-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/depression-sensor-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/depression-sensor-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Scientific literature shows that low levels of BDNF are one of the factors involved in some neurological and psychiatric disorders associated with cognitive decline. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biosensor is the result of a partnership between researchers at the University of São Paulo (USP) and Embrapa Instrumentação, a decentralized unit of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa). It consists of a flexible strip with electrodes that, when integrated with a portable analyzer, evaluates drops of human saliva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In less than three minutes, the biosensor provides the concentration of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), a protein crucial for the growth and maintenance of neurons and the development of brain functions, including learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;ACS Polymers Au&lt;/em&gt;, shows that the device can reliably measure extremely low concentrations of the protein in a wide range of saliva (from 10⁻²⁰ to 10⁻¹⁰ grams per milliliter), down to minimal amounts that are still detectable (1.0 × 10⁻²⁰ grams per milliliter).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biosensor has an estimated cost of US$2.19 per unit — less than R$12.00 at the current exchange rate — and long-term storage capacity. According to the scientists, the next step is to obtain the patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are few sensors that perform this type of analysis, and ours was the one that performed best. It detected a wide range of concentrations, which is a very good result from a clinical point of view. When protein levels are very low, it can serve as a warning sign for diseases and psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the other hand, by being able to signal an increase in BDNF, it contributes as a tool to monitor the patient’s progress according to the treatment,” explains Paulo Augusto Raymundo Pereira, a researcher at the São Carlos Institute of Physics (IFSC-USP) and corresponding author of the article, in an interview with Agência FAPESP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pereira, who has experience in chemistry and biotechnology, has been working with flexible sensors and electrochemical biosensors. Last year, he was one of the authors of an article in the &lt;em&gt;Chemical Engineering Journal &lt;/em&gt;that presented the results of a portable sensor for urine self-testing aimed at detecting markers of diseases such as gout and Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link to disorders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific literature shows that low levels of BDNF are one of the factors involved in some neurological and psychiatric disorders associated with cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is one such disorder. The effect of the protein is restored by antidepressants. Healthy individuals have BDNF levels above 20 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL), whereas people with major depressive disorder (MDD) have levels below 10 or 12 ng/mL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 1 billion people live with mental disorders, with anxiety and depression being the most prevalent conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the organization’s reports, including the &lt;em&gt;Mental Health Atlas 2024&lt;/em&gt;, these disorders have increased in prevalence in all countries, affecting people of all ages and income levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2022 and 2024, worker absences due to mental health issues in Brazil increased by 134%. According to the Occupational Safety and Health Observatory, these absences rose from 201,000 to 472,000 and were caused by episodes of depression, anxiety, and recurrent depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pereira adds, “The increase in cases of mental disorders and the consequent rise in the use of medication, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, motivated us to work on this issue and seek alternatives.” Pereira has the support of FAPESP through scholarships (16/01919-6, 23/09685-8, and 22/02164-0).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The device&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers developed a flexible strip screen-printed on a polyester film substrate with three electrodes: one functionalized working electrode, one pure carbon auxiliary electrode, and one silver reference electrode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The working electrode was modified with carbon nanospheres. It received a layer of two chemical compounds – polyethyleneimine and glutaraldehyde – to increase sensitivity and act as a matrix to immobilize the BDNF-specific capture antibody (anti-BDNF). To prevent other types of interaction, a reactive layer of ethanolamine was added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BDNF detection is based on the formation of antibody-antigen immunocomplexes, which increase resistance to electron transfer on the sensor surface. This growth is captured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, a technique used to study processes that occur at the interface between an electrode and a solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results can be displayed in real time on a mobile device (smartphone) via wireless communication (Bluetooth).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current techniques used to analyze BDNF levels include the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), electrochemiluminescence, fluorescence, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These techniques require time, large sample volumes, and specialized laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re moving toward personalized medicine, in which treatments will be increasingly tailored to each individual. In the case of the biosensor, it can be optimized to suit different profiles,” says the researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;FAPESP also supported the study through the Thematic Project “Towards the Convergence of Technologies: From Sensors and Biosensors to Information Visualization and Machine Learning for Data Analysis in Clinical Diagnosis”, as well as two other projects (23/07686-7 and 20/09587-8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team includes the following researchers: Nathalia Gomes, Marcelo Luiz Calegaro, Luiz Henrique Capparelli Mattoso, Sergio Antonio Spinola Machado, and Osvaldo de Oliveira Junior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761774866988"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt;

These assessments confirmed the sustainability of the disposable BDNF immunosensor strip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This device provides a rapid, efficient, cost-effective, and reliable method for the decentralized, noninvasive salivary analysis of BDNF, enabling broader applications in healthcare, wellness monitoring, and medical diagnostics related to the neurotrophin family of biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 22:00:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPLXJMSUs3Xzg4am1rRnBRS3hHS2Q1OFhTUFFYUHN1UDhCSGtxZHRTRE10bGlQZHN4SC1DcGNXTHpHTzlsckViMmdiXzJlU1p2X1ZGLTVBQm1KZ3hPWFZKd25tdGtVS18yMm0xczdFQm9mM1l6WmVDaWJkYjk1ekp0QWhRbw</guid></item><item><title>开创性的新化合物可以治疗世界上最致命的传染病- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/groundbreaking-new-compound-could-treat-the-worlds-deadliest-infectious-disease/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 21:51:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOdHM2M19ZX2pXNWRlQzlYXzFZUFFPdEl1b2YxRWNaT2NjQkdGZzZjRjlXS3N4cjRDNDFCZnpxTWhOdG1lOHNmMUY1dWZFRTRTTEliekx2ODZ1U0R2WUx6R3RYdFhfd0ZVdjNrUTI5YW1wd1ZZd3I2clNKQjJWM1VCaXBudENHeTVqRjh5OU13M0tScmtlU1p4Rm1xM3AxaHhOU1g1S0dMQ1g</guid></item><item><title>26岁的眼泪文件在眼角膜“死亡”后失明： “我感到无能为力” （独家） -雅虎加拿大新闻</title><link>https://ca.news.yahoo.com/26-old-tearfully-documents-going-214301485.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;McEwen Baker has undergone 24 eye surgeries and is now going blind&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The 26-year-old opened up to PEOPLE about her experience and coming to terms with her progressive vision loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After sharing her journey on social media, she is now establishing an online community&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A TikToker is opening up about her experience going blind at age 26, hoping to be transparent about the difficulties she faces and find a sense of community as she adjusts to her progressive vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@_qtip_" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:McEwen Baker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;McEwen Baker&lt;/a&gt;, a Chicago-based actress and bridal stylist, was just 2 years old when she started to experience pain and redness in her eyes. The symptoms were initially dismissed by her doctor as seasonal allergies, but when her eyes worsened, her mother pushed for a consultation with an eye specialist. Thankfully, she was able to connect with experts at&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/wilmer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute&lt;/a&gt; and travel from her hometown of Versailles, Kentucky, for a second opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“My mom said, ‘I just really feel in my gut that something is wrong,’ ” Baker tells PEOPLE. Baker was diagnosed with uveitis, a form of eye inflammation that can lead to serious complications like glaucoma, which she developed at age 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;McEwen Baker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McEwen at age 11&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;From that point, Baker, now 26, spent her childhood undergoing numerous optical treatments. But when she was 15, a “horrible” accident to her right eye significantly set back her journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“A lot of the surgeries that I had previously were disrupted by this one event,” she recalls, explaining that the traumatic incident caused her cornea cells to "die off."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;McEwen Baker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McEwen visiting an eye specialist in February 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As a result, Baker underwent partial cornea transplants for her right eye in 2017 and 2020, both of which only held up for a few years.

She continued her medications, wore glasses and relied on her left eye to read and drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But she knew it was not getting better. “I started to realize, okay, this is not ending — and I'm feeling myself experiencing medical trauma around things that I can't control."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;McEwen Baker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McEwen with her mom after surgery in November 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While navigating that harsh reality, everything changed for Baker in March 2023, when she woke up to what she calls one of the scariest days of her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I woke up on St. Patrick's Day and couldn't see the light on my ceiling,” she recalls. “I was like, what happened to the light? And then I realized I couldn't see anything around me. It was kind of like a white haze, almost like you're waking up in a really foggy place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She later learned that the cornea in her left eye was starting to die off just as her right eye had done. “That was one of the hardest things I've ever had to hear because I knew what that meant and I knew that there wasn’t really a solution,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;McEwen Baker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McEwen Baker in October 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Baker was told that what she experienced the morning of St. Patrick’s Day was a condition called corneal edema — something she’d have to manage consistently moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Essentially what happens is when those cells are dying and swelling, it creates this haze across your vision that doesn't allow light to refract, and then it warms up over time,” she explains. “So that's how it started out. I would wake up and have 30 minutes of blindness, and then it would warm up and be totally fine for the rest of the day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“But the general consensus was that it would continue to deteriorate and that swelling period would last longer and longer,” she continues. “And eventually those 30 minutes turned into an hour, and then two hours, and now I've gone almost a week with no vision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She admits she hasn't yet learned how to do things without vision. “So when I do have full days or full weeks of vision loss, I am kind of at a loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Baker’s longest span without vision was in August 2025, and the loss was starting to take a greater toll on her mentally. “The progression of my disease seems to just be a little bit more rapid than we thought it would be. I never imagined that I wouldn't be seeing for full days at a time,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She’s been talking to a therapist regularly to help with her mental health as she navigates this “huge life transition.” And as a new resident of Chicago, she was encouraged to find support groups to help adjust to her new reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Struggling to do so, Baker decided to post an extremely vulnerable video on TikTok sharing her journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I am actively going blind at the ripe age of 26…and it’s happening more quickly than I ever anticipated and it’s now starting to infringe on my life in a really real way,” she said in the Aug. 19 post, tearfully asking her followers for resources and a community to help her transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I really need to talk to people who are also experiencing this because I’m feeling like this a lot,” she added. “I have a lot of dreams and ambitions that I feel powerless to obtain in this current life shift and that really really sucks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In another video, Baker tearfully documented “what a bad day looks like” with progressive vision loss. She said she couldn’t see herself in the mirror, couldn’t read text messages and couldn’t even see her couch across the room in her apartment. She then showed herself trying to lift her own spirits by getting dressed and forcing herself to go outside independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Baker tells PEOPLE that her vision is different every single day but she’s not completely blind yet. She says she’s in awe of how many people she’s been able to connect with online in the past two months and she’s grateful for the additional support she has moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I was so overwhelmed in the best way,” she says, starting to cry. “I’m still emotional about it, but it just feels like I found the good side of the internet. It has just been one of the most uplifting experiences and has instilled some hope in me that I didn't think I would access again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Grief isn't linear,” she adds. “I definitely still have days where I am angry or really sad or bargaining with the idea that this is the trajectory of my life. But overall, I think I am moving towards a place of acceptance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/26-year-old-documents-going-blind-exclusive-11837409" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News Canada</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 21:43:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE44V0s3TjdFNmdCX2hQNkFCUFhBVjBmOTUwTGRLM203WG90OWttQm9qdVUyR2tZOXd0YUtZUjRzNktSZGNEaHFIZzlSbVVOUTJpU0F0ZnI2cGo2U3lDNUV3dUppR1ByNzZtMm4zdXpWTkRYeDVsTE1rTE1rQnBSdw</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，降低这种类型的胆固醇可以“显着”降低痴呆风险。你听说过吗？ - Money Talks新闻</title><link>https://www.moneytalksnews.com/reducing-this-type-of-cholesterol-may-lower-dementia-risk-significantly-study-finds-have-you-even-heard-of-it/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Money Talks News</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 21:40:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2AFBVV95cUxOb2lzYzBDVlExUEVMQTZ1QWR3dUV6dWVzOXkyMEpuUEJQX3RYSUswMmJZNGFoY3BJdlpWdF9FU1ROang5V2JRVWRTLVcxdUp1SDQ3OHFxWU9SVVNVVDNSS3JwYWZyNF9uM0JRR0QtVTBfZWJvLWJET3RwdlRVOFItdS1LYlBfOGV3U1VmQUpIUGNMNmZCZ3hGOEp4Z3JuUGRwbmhNbm84LTkxUHRkeVV6VDhERjVxV0I5Yjh0RTg0Uk1LYXE2NmZFOFBlWVcxVUpzdDhMb0VsOVA</guid></item><item><title>狗身上发现的“神秘分子”可以帮助人类活得更长、更健康- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/mystery-molecules-found-in-dogs-could-help-humans-live-longer-healthier-lives/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 21:26:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQZEFETEtFMWhubTZQbDUtVnBhWXJVNFh5V2dYRGkxN3VSRUxyUTBXR2ZKd0g4QldoU0tkOUZtd2I5WkpuU1FnMWdQNkxqbGhVRXRoM05qVW14WGVrQWU3YUR0eGk3UGFXYU1GbTRrSmlsTjczTkhRdGxsWVhyeGtMMGZ1cDVhNUF3eUhFY3J3ZU0xOC1jVjVMX01oMVdscFRrNTZUYl9n</guid></item><item><title>Portneuf医疗中心在对脏手术工具进行调查后做出改变- East Idaho News</title><link>https://www.eastidahonews.com/2025/10/portneuf-medical-center-makes-changes-after-investigation-into-dirty-surgical-tools/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleText"&gt; &lt;p&gt;POCATELLO — Following an investigation into unclean surgical tools, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare found that multiple surgical patients nearly came in contact with tissue fragments left on medical tools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://publicdocuments.dhw.idaho.gov/WebLink/DocView.aspx?id=34931&amp;amp;dbid=0&amp;amp;repo=PUBLIC-DOCUMENTS&amp;amp;preview=true" target="_blank"&gt;results from a formal complaint&lt;/a&gt; filed with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, officials conducted an “unannounced on-site complaint investigation” at Portneuf Medical Center from Sept. 2 to 7, 2025.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The incident report states that multiple “deficiencies” were cited during a federal complaint to the Center for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services, including that Portneuf Medical Center “failed to ensure patients received care in a safe setting for 1 of 6 patients whose medical records were reviewed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The complaint discusses incidents involving two patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Portneuf Medical Center officials state that the issues have been fully resolved and that they quickly identified the problem, initiating an extensive internal investigation almost immediately after the issue was discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;The first patient&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first patient was a 61-year-old woman scheduled to receive a lumbar fusion surgery on Aug. 20. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In notes about the surgery, a physician who is not identified reportedly states, “While preparing to perform discectomy, my scrub tech notified me that there was biological material (tissue fragment) within the trials (surgical instrument). Therefore, back table was contaminated and we elected to abort the procedure and send the materials back to central processing for appropriate cleansing and sterilization.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The notes then say the physician spoke with the anesthesiologist, who is also not identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The director of anesthesiologist (sic) who felt that (the patient) would be fine in the lateral position, so I packed the wound with betadine-soaked 4x4s and placed drapes over the wound,” the notes stated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The medical professional “then left the room and then came back once the instruments were prepared. … There were no complications.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the incident report states that there could have been complications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There was nothing documented regarding whether the risks of keeping the patient under anesthesia for several extra hours outweighed the benefits,” the report states.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the Director of Perioperative Services stated that they were aware the patient would be under anesthesia for an additional three hours as the surgical instruments were properly cleaned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another document reportedly showed that the patient had three significant drops in blood pressure from the time the anesthesia was started at 7:04 a.m., and the time it ended at 2:42 p.m.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/PMC.jpg" alt="Portneuf Medical Center" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-622226" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/PMC.jpg 900w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/PMC.jpg 600w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/PMC-300x200.jpg 300w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/PMC-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/PMC-860x573.jpg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/PMC-750x500.jpg 750w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Portneuf Medical Center&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The patient’s Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA) was interviewed on Sept. 4, where he stated that when they flipped the patient to the prone (facedown) position, he “could not obtain a blood pressure from her arterial line or any of her 4 limbs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He then said he gave her medication to raise her blood pressure, which was successful. The CRNA reportedly voiced concern about the “significant presser support” that the patient needed, and about continuing the surgery. At that point, the incident report says they decided to abort the case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When asked what the benefit was to keeping the patient under anesthesia while the dirty surgical instruments were cleaned, the CRNA responded there was “no real benefit and keeping her asleep was not preferred.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CRNA allegedly also said he was “unsure if it was safe to close her as the incision had already been made.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the incident report, the patient was not able to have the surgery that day. It was rescheduled for a week later, and she stayed in the hospital for 11 days.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It was unclear if the prolonged anesthesia time while waiting on the surgical instruments was beneficial to patient,” says the incident report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;The second patient&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The incident report says another patient was also affected by the unclean surgical tools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the investigation into the allegations, the hospital reportedly provided a list of all instances of Immediate Use Steam Sterilization (IUSS) over the past year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Immediate_Use_Steam_Sterilization_022011.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;, IUSS is a “steam sterilization cycle where unwrapped medical instruments are subjected to an abbreviated steam exposure time and then used promptly after cycle completion without being stored.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One entry from June stated “the rep brought 1 tray (instrument tray) and there wasn’t enough time between cases to process (instruments) per standard protocol.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On June 16, a 68-year-old man reportedly underwent shoulder surgery and was reportedly “moved into the OR while the surgical instruments intended for his procedure had not yet completed sterile processing.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the “narrative states this was done to “appease” the physician, who was described as being on a “war path.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sterile processing manager was interviewed on Sept. 3, and said the dirty instrument was put through IUSS “based on the physician’s insistence, who did not want to disrupt his surgical schedule.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Vice President of Quality was also interviewed about this incident, and confirmed that the Chief Medical Officer had spoken to the physician about the misuse of IUSS, “emphasizing that it is intended for emergencies – not for convenience.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When asked for documentation of re-education or corrective action, Portneuf Medical Center provided none, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The hospital failed to appropriately document re-education or retraining for the physician ad permitted the use of IUSS for convenience,” the report says. “This failure to enforce infection control standards and staff accountability placed future patients at risk for surgical site infections.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Dirty tools being left dry&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Sept. 2, investigators reportedly observed dirty instruments being cleaned in the decontamination room, and the sterile processing technician was observed “creating the incorrect concentration of enzymatic cleaner to water.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On this same day, investigators said, a cart full of used surgical instruments waiting to be cleaned were “visibly soiled with dry blood.” According to the incident report, “they were observed with the sterile processing technician, who agreed they were not kept moist.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The hospital failed to ensure surgical instruments were kept moist between use in the OR and decontamination,” the incident report says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Portneuf-Medical.jpg" alt="Portneuf Medical" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-634842" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Portneuf-Medical.jpg 900w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Portneuf-Medical-600x400.jpg 600w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Portneuf-Medical-300x200.jpg 300w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Portneuf-Medical-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Portneuf-Medical-860x573.jpg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Portneuf-Medical-750x500.jpg 750w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Portneuf Medical Center | Courtesy photo&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3&gt;‘A white substance’&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Sept 7, the director of quality was interviewed and “confirmed there were no documented benefits to keeping patient under anesthesia while the surgical instruments were reprocessed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The incident report for the patient continues, saying it was also “unclear why (the) patient’s physician documented she “tolerated the procedure well” and “there were no complications” when the procedure had to be aborted prior to completion due to extreme hypotension” before concluding that “the hospital failed to ensure patients received care in a safe setting.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report also states that the “facility failed to maintain a clean and sanitary environment to avoid sources and transmission of infection.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Sept. 2, during a tour of the sterile processing area, it was reportedly “noted the commercial cart washer, located inside an area referred to as “prep and pack” was observed with a white substance accumulated on the front of the doors running from the top of the doors to the bottom in several different columns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A sterile processing staff member was asked about the white substance and reportedly stated it was “difficult to clean” and and the vendor was the one who maintained the cart washer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investigators tried to obtain a cleaning log or schedule but were told it was “not available.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It was unclear when or how the cart washer was cleaned,” the report states. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The director of compliance confirmed that the cart washer should be regularly cleaned and that a cleaning schedule would be developed going forward. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Due to there being instances of bioburden on supposedly clean and sterile surgical instruments, the allegation was substantiated,” the findings report from the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare states. “However, due to the extensive action plan, no deficiencies relation to the allegation were cited.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Essentially, because he hospital had already remedied the situation, there were no remaining issues that needed to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings state that upon noticing the dirty instruments not being properly cleaned, and an increase in surgical site infections, “the Quality Management Department and infection control officer conducted an extensive investigation in to the incidents.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Through the internal investigation, which included record review, interview, and observation, they discovered the cause of the problem was a breakdown in the reprocessing responsibilities between the vendor surgical trays (instruments not owned by the hospital) and the SPD,” the findings state. “There was a lack of training to the Sterile Processing Department (SPD) on how to reprocess vendor trays, which contained instruments the staff were not familiar with and did not know how to clean properly.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings say the vendors had access to the sterile processing area where they were leaving trays, and SPD did not know which trays had been pre-cleaned. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of the investigation, the findings include remediation plants to correct the problem such as revoking the vendor’s access to the Sterile Processing Department and “implementing a ‘hard stop’ where if staff were not familiar with instruments, they would not reprocess them.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Hospital responds&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;EastIdahoNews.com reached out to Portneuf Medical Center for a comment on the allegations and findings, and we were sent the following statement:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The safety and well-being of our patients is always our highest priority. Earlier this year, we self-identified an isolated issue with reprocessing certain specialized surgical instruments provided by an outside vendor. We immediately launched a thorough review and engaged an independent third-party expert to evaluate and strengthen our protocols. We moved quickly to retrain staff and add safeguards to prevent this from happening again, including implementing additional requirements for vendors. Recent state and accreditation surveys have confirmed the issue was successfully addressed. We proactively reached out to the small number of individuals whose procedures were affected, and all concerns related to this matter have been fully resolved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>East Idaho News</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 21:14:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxNZXNleXEwNVV3V1pyV1NQOV93U1Y1WktfaUpITHdDWmFEU2l6U0I3eG56YUxBa0ZyQWFmb0NUUEU4QnVMZTJOMWFFUldBMXpEUUZqRHlubmRzeTdmcm5aaVlreVRUQ0Q5UjZJeTNkQnBlV0lSUzhYaXNzaVRveWhqd2taQUJLTldFZThJdm95dThPUEpMMHZ1X0hqZHVmT2RtTW5hWlhiejVCSFpTdkVURmJ0dGZ3SHREbHJUNmpQbw</guid></item><item><title>新冠肺炎和流感可能会使您的心脏病发作风险增加三倍-纽约时报</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/well/viral-infections-covid-flu-heart-attacks.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 21:10:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNakt1bUlrc2U3aWJGSGJ5SnktdDBWRUoyVGtBa3RjRVZjQVJCMjhKYTJYR2NJLUVMNnIxb2tXSzRVWGRNcUdUUTFrN1FNR1RDZldsZDZYcFF4V2J2eERkaVZQWkEyMU1wVGFBT3U4dmxlenR6eVJPYjFiZUttbnViNVRqdmRrUUJnLWhKWWRn</guid></item><item><title>医生恳求您打破这种常见的日常习惯，让您第二天感到筋疲力尽- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/leighweingus/big-meal-energy-levels</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;“Regular exercise can help improve energy levels by increasing blood flow and oxygen to the brain and muscles,” said Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielle-kelvas-md-488936186/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7965452" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Danielle Kelvas&lt;/a&gt;, a physician based in Chattanooga, Tennessee. “Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each day, such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for diet, “a diet that is rich in whole, unprocessed foods can help provide sustained energy throughout the day,” Kelvas said. “Focus on eating a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid consuming too much sugar and processed foods, as these can cause energy crashes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, chronic stress is a big reason for diminished energy levels, as fatigue is a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/emotional-exhaustion-during-times-of-unrest" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7965452" data-affiliate="true"&gt;known side effect of stress and emotional exhaustion&lt;/a&gt;. “Practice stress-management techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga to help reduce stress levels and improve energy,” Kelvas suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When To Talk To Your Doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

A case-control study of KP.2-adapted COVID-19 vaccines showed a VE of 68%. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"While these [COVID-19] effectiveness estimates are not the 90% or higher seen early in the pandemic against ancestral SARS-CoV-2, they represent meaningful protection against hospitalization and severe disease," said lead author Jake Scott, MD, clinical associate professor at Stanford University School of Medicine's infectious disease and geographic medicine division.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"These magnitudes are comparable to long-standing influenza vaccine performance," he added. "Even moderate effectiveness can avert large numbers of [hospital] admissions when circulation is high."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;RSV prevention was especially strong, with pooled estimates of 68% for maternal vaccination protecting infants, 83% for the monoclonal antibody preventive nirsevimab in infants, and 79% for RSV vaccination against hospitalization in older adults. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The pooled VE of the flu vaccine against hospitalization was 48% in adults and 67% in children across networks and countries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Low risk of myocarditis, Guillain-Barre syndrome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Similar to previous evaluation findings, COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) occurred at rates of 1.3 to 3.1 per 100,000 doses in young males, with lower risks seen with longer dosing intervals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Self-controlled analyses of the latest XBB.1.5-era formulations did not detect a significant myocarditis signal," Scott said. "Absolute risk are low."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Likewise, the risk of RSV vaccine-related Guillain-Barre syndrome (a peripheral nerve disorder) was low, with 18.2 excess cases per million doses in older adults. For maternal RSV vaccination, no link to preterm birth was seen when administered at 32 to 36 weeks' gestation. "This pattern warrants continued monitoring but does not change the overall benefit-risk balance, given the burden of severe RSV disease," Scott said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scott said the findings support coadministration of a COVID-19 and flu vaccine or RSV and flu vaccine, which can increase access and uptake. "Across studies of COVID plus influenza and RSV plus influenza vaccination, immunogenicity and safety were similar whether vaccines were given together or separately," he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Respiratory-virus vaccines 'cornerstone' of prevention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The VIP aims to inform—not make—policy, Dugdale said: "Our hope is that the various professional societies and public health organizations that are actively working on crafting guidance for the public about the use and safety of these vaccines can lean on the data that we've summarized that have emerged over the last year to 2 years on these three infections and their associated immunizations to be able to form the guidance that they're messaging to the public."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

While rabies is extremely rare in humans in California, exposure through bat bites is a serious concern," said Riverside County Public Health Officer Dr. Jennifer Chevinsky. "Bites from a bat can be painless and may not leave marks, so it’s important to seek immediate care if you awaken to a bat in your home."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bats are the most common carriers of rabies in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent or reduce risk of a rabies infection, residents should do the following: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never pick up or touch a bat. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vaccinate pets against rabies. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report possible exposures to animal control or Public Health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Safety proof homes by sealing gaps and openings that could allow bats inside. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid contact with bats and other wild animals (skunks, racoons, foxes and coyotes). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have interacted with a bat, wash the area immediately with soap and water and seek medical care right away, the county said. Medical professionals would assess for post-exposure vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 100,000 Americans receive rabies vaccinations each year after potential exposures, according to the Riverside County Department of Animal Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If a pet contracts rabies, it can take a few days or several months for signs to appear," said Dr. Amy Raines, Riverside County Department of Animal Services Chief Veterinarian. "Never feed or touch wild animals, and make sure pets are protected when outdoors. The best prevention for pets is rabies vaccination, which helps protect pets and the people who love them."  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of rabies in dogs and cats can include the following: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased aggression, irritability, or lethargy/unresponsiveness &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mild fever  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty walking or lack of coordination &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drooling or foaming at the mouth due to difficulty swallowing &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paralysis in the throat or jaw, making it difficult to eat or drink &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Riverside County, all dogs are required to be vaccinated against rabies, which should start at 4 months of age, with regular boosters throughout their life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions about rabies or local resources?

Health officials then spent Tuesday trying to contact the person to confirm they were sick, according to the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The infected person has been unwilling to share even their address, Rupp added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;If confirmed, the Salt Lake County case would add to the &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/"&gt;59 confirmed measles cases in Utah this year&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, with two of those cases confirmed within the last three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Dorothy Adams, the Salt Lake County Health Department’s executive director, emphasized that information a patient shares in an illness interview is confidential, collected “only to investigate the source of illness and attempt to prevent further spread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The department stressed in its news release that people can ask health investigators to prove they are who they say they are, by asking for an email from their official “.gov” address. People contacted by phone can hang up, call the health department back and ask to be transferred to the investigator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;People who have not been immunized against the virus and are exposed have a 90% chance of becoming infected, the county health department said. However, the agency said, people who receive two doses of the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine are protected from the virus 97% of the time — and if a vaccinated person does get infected, the symptoms are typically milder than they would be for an unvaccinated person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;One in every five unvaccinated people who are infected end up needing to be hospitalized, the county health department said. The department is asking health care providers to keep measles in mind as a possibility when diagnosing patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Typical symptoms for measles, the county health department said, include fever, cough, a runny nose or red, watery eyes within one or two weeks of being infected. Two or three days after those symptoms occur, people will develop small white spots in their mouth. A day or two after that, they will see a rash on their hairline or face that spreads to the rest of their body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;If someone suspects they have the measles, the agency said, they should call their health provider before going to see them — so the provider can make plans to isolate them, so other patients aren’t at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Salt Lake Tribune</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 20:15:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTFBMUGt6WHZ5bjlzbXN3MEFzdjRrVFN6dmdSemxpbmpNRHhWTlpuVWdxSTIwWDF3aFpaVWVBZW80VXVwMlJBdExrMG42SUVocHR1MG8wdXBxVHk3ZTZHRzFLNjRDTERjTm5BeEFVWlJZY3MzYl9zSWkzenB3</guid></item><item><title>为什么牙齿不算骨头？ - Live Science</title><link>https://www.livescience.com/health/anatomy/why-dont-teeth-count-as-bones</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto paywall-locker"&gt;
&lt;p id="0337cb92-33ac-4264-9e1f-235d2cf2fb86"&gt;At first glance, teeth look a lot like bones: Both are hard, white and rich in calcium. So why aren't teeth considered part of the skeletal system? Even though teeth and bones share a few basic similarities, they're actually quite different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The major resemblance between &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/24655-teeth" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/24655-teeth" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;teeth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/25176-bones" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/25176-bones" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is what they're made of: hard tissue composed of minerals, such as calcium, phosphorus, fluoride and magnesium. On a molecular level, these minerals form a solid crystal structure, which is what makes both teeth and bones so much harder than everything else in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="0337cb92-33ac-4264-9e1f-235d2cf2fb86-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;"They're mineralized tissue," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dentistry.ucla.edu/people/edmond-r-hewlett-dds" target="_blank" data-url="https://dentistry.ucla.edu/people/edmond-r-hewlett-dds" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Edmond Hewlett&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor emeritus at the UCLA School of Dentistry. "But there, frankly, the similarity ends."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-484835e3-4f1c-4487-8994-dee9d3897aa3" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="functions-of-teeth-and-bones-3"&gt;Functions of teeth and bones&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="fb81d1ba-7267-466f-94f1-31f579fa6117"&gt;One reason teeth aren't considered part of the skeletal system is that teeth serve an entirely different function than bones do, Hewlett said. The primary job of teeth is to break down food as it enters the digestive tract, though they're also important for producing speech. Due to their main job, your pearly whites are considered part of the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bones have different jobs. They provide structure and support to the body, creating attachment points for our muscular system. They also protect vital organs, housing key body parts such as the heart and lungs. And bones serve as production factories for both red and white blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body and play a key role in the immune system, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some small overlap in the functions of teeth and bones, though. The bones in the jaw do help to support the teeth and are important for chewing, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They work together but are separate," Hewlett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-w9GQxPBsshz485owMN9SwD" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-w9GQxPBsshz485owMN9SwD slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a id="elk-aed74109-a789-416d-8119-13308ba4e951" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="structure-of-teeth-and-bones-3"&gt;Structure of teeth and bones&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="fd5b7475-01ec-4244-bde7-7dbec497b28e"&gt;Because bones and teeth do different jobs, they're also built differently. The outer structure of teeth is called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/24798-tooth-enamel" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/24798-tooth-enamel" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;enamel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a thin layer of mineralized tissue. Enamel is the hardest substance in the body — a property it gets from jam-packed crystals made from a compound of calcium and phosphate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underneath the enamel lies dentin, a type of mineralized tissue that's slightly softer than enamel but still hard. Dentin makes up the majority of a tooth's structure, and it contains tiny tubes that hold blood vessels and nerve endings. The core of the tooth is made of a jelly-like substance called pulp, which houses more blood vessels that provide nutrients to the tooth and to the nerves that control feeling in the tooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/anatomy-of-the-bone" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/anatomy-of-the-bone" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;structure of bones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, looks completely different to that of teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bones are covered in a very thin, tough outer layer called the periosteum, which houses both blood vessels and nerves essential for growth and healing in the tissue.

By targeting the gene &lt;em&gt;Arc&lt;/em&gt;—which helps neurons adjust their connections—scientists used CRISPR-based tools to either boost or silence its activity in engram cells within the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silencing &lt;em&gt;Arc&lt;/em&gt; blocked memory formation, while activating it strengthened recall, even days later, and these effects were reversible. The discovery offers groundbreaking insight into how gene regulation within memory cells can control learning and forgetting, opening possibilities for future therapies in PTSD and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Gene Target:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers used CRISPR tools to control the &lt;em&gt;Arc&lt;/em&gt; gene in memory-storing engram cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reversible Editing:&lt;/strong&gt; Turning &lt;em&gt;Arc&lt;/em&gt; off weakened or erased memory, while turning it on enhanced recall—and both effects could be undone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Promise:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings point toward new strategies for treating PTSD, addiction, and age-related memory loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;EPFL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our experiences leave traces in the brain, stored in small groups of cells called “engrams”. Engrams are thought to hold the information of a memory and are reactivated when we remember, which makes them very interesting to research on memory and age- or trauma-related memory loss.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, scientists know that the biology of learning is accompanied by epigenetic changes, which refers to the ways the cell regulates genes by adding chemical “post-it notes” on DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113632"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/memory-epigenetic-switch-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/memory-epigenetic-switch-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/memory-epigenetic-switch-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/memory-epigenetic-switch-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/memory-epigenetic-switch-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/memory-epigenetic-switch-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/memory-epigenetic-switch-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/memory-epigenetic-switch-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a neuron and DNA." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/memory-epigenetic-switch-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/memory-epigenetic-switch-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/memory-epigenetic-switch-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/memory-epigenetic-switch-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/memory-epigenetic-switch-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/memory-epigenetic-switch-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/memory-epigenetic-switch-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study showed that epigenetically silencing Arc in engram cells made the mice not learn, while boosting it made their memory stronger. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the question of whether the epigenetic state of a single gene in turn can cause a memory to change has thus far remained unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team led by Professor Johannes Gräff at EPFL’s Laboratory of Neuroepigenetics combined CRISPR-based gene control with a technique that tags engram cells in mice. They focused on &lt;em&gt;Arc&lt;/em&gt;, a gene that helps neurons adjust their connections to other neurons. By targeting the control region of &lt;em&gt;Arc&lt;/em&gt;, the team asked whether flipping its epigenetic “switch” could directly change memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An “epigenetic switch”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers developed specialized, CRISPR-based tools that could either dial down or boost &lt;em&gt;Arc&lt;/em&gt; activity in memory neurons. Some, like the KRAB-MeCP2 tool, were designed to switch off gene activity by adding repressive marks that make the DNA less accessible, while others opened the DNA and turned the gene on. These tools were essentially an “epigenetic switch” for the &lt;em&gt;Arc&lt;/em&gt; gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then used harmless viruses to deliver these tools directly into the hippocampus of mice, a brain region central for storing and retrieving memory. The mice were then trained to link a specific place with a mild foot shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By changing the epigenetic state of &lt;em&gt;Arc&lt;/em&gt; in the neurons, the scientists could see whether the animals remembered the shock or not. They also added a “safety switch” that could undo the editing and reset the memory state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed that epigenetically silencing &lt;em&gt;Arc&lt;/em&gt; in engram cells made the mice not learn, while boosting it made their memory stronger. These changes could be reversed in the same animal, showing that this epigenetic “switch” can dial memory expression up or down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even memories that were already several days old, which are usually hard to change, could be modified. On the molecular level, the editing caused changes in gene activity and DNA packaging that matched the behavioral effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controlling memory expression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is the first direct demonstration that changing the epigenetic state in memory cells is necessary and sufficient to control memory expression. It points to new ways of exploring how memories are stored and altered, which could eventually also be relevant in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, similar approaches could help researchers better understand conditions where memory processing goes awry, such as traumatic memories in PTSD, drug-related memories in addiction, or the memory problems that appear in neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761767183694"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What did scientists manipulate to control memory?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; They altered the epigenetic state of the &lt;em&gt;Arc&lt;/em&gt; gene in hippocampal engram cells, switching memory expression up or down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761767185681"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How does this affect memory?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Silencing &lt;em&gt;Arc&lt;/em&gt; prevented learning and recall, while boosting it strengthened existing memories, even after they had stabilized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761767185615"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Why is this discovery significant?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s the first evidence that directly changing a single gene’s epigenetic state in memory cells can control memory formation and retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this epigenetics and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b3dd9dc3d2c3d2d4d6dcc1d4dadcc6f3d6c3d5df9dd0db" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nik Papageorgiou&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://epfl.ch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EPFL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Nik Papageorgiou – EPFL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41588-025-02368-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cell-type and locus-specific epigenetic editing of memory expression&lt;/a&gt;” by Johannes Gräff et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Genetics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cell-type and locus-specific epigenetic editing of memory expression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epigenetic mechanisms have long been proposed to act as molecular mnemonics, but whether the epigenetic makeup of a single genomic site can guide learnt behaviors remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we combined CRISPR-based epigenetic editing tools with c-Fos-driven engram technologies to address this question in memory-bearing neuronal ensembles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the promoter of &lt;em&gt;Arc&lt;/em&gt;, which encodes a master regulator of synaptic plasticity, we found that its locus-specific and temporally controlled epigenetic editing is necessary and sufficient to regulate memory expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such effects occurred irrespective of the memory phase—during the initially labile period after learning and for fully consolidated memories—and were reversible within subject, testifying to their inherent plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings provide a proof-of-principle that site-specific epigenetic dynamics are causally implicated in memory expression.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 19:51:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE1ZTHVOWEx3b2tSOXpKZFFwMmc5VDNaNE1NamJpWksyUE1tdGVjNERlY2JvQWVhbjFXM0dMM05mc0VSVEsxQ3Vyd1FUTUwtdVFtVXVmSUE0SkwtZFpCRVNhdjRvLWhnSHpSaWF4WA</guid></item><item><title>红葡萄酒或白葡萄酒：科学判断心脏健康状况- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/red-or-white-wine-science-gives-its-heart-health-verdict/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large international analysis finds that people who drink wine have a lower risk of coronary heart disease. The most important number is 24 percent lower risk for adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work comes from a team in Spain that pooled long running population studies from several countries and regions. The finding centers on wine, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-alcohol-in-moderation-does-not-prolong-life/"&gt;not alcohol in general&lt;/a&gt;, and it applies to adults who already choose to drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-wine-and-heart-health"&gt;Studying wine and heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A meta-analysis study pooled data from long term cohorts and case control studies to examine wine and heart outcomes. The authors compared adults who drank wine with adults who did not drink wine in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key estimate was a relative risk, a ratio that compares event rates between groups, of 0.76 for coronary heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That value means the wine group had a 24 percent lower rate of disease than the non-wine group during multi-year follow up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alicia Saz-Lara led the research effort at the Health and Social Research Center of the University of Castilla-La Mancha in Spain (&lt;a href="https://www.uclm.es/en/misiones/lauclm/institucional/uclmsaludable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCLM&lt;/a&gt;), where population health is a central focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies followed people for many years across Europe, the United States, and Australia. The scale was large, with more than a million adults represented in total across diverse settings and lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-matters-most"&gt;What matters most?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wine carries &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-polyphenols-promote-heart-health-youthful-skin-and-a-healthy-waistline/"&gt;polyphenols&lt;/a&gt;, plant compounds with antioxidant and signaling effects, mostly from grape skins and seeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red wines usually have more of these compounds than white wines due to longer skin contact during fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a controlled &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circresaha.112.275636"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;, dealcoholized red wine lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure in men at high cardiovascular risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect aligned with increases in nitric oxide, a molecule that relaxes blood vessels and supports vessel flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main analysis here did not separate red and white wine by type with enough detail to rank one above the other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people who drink, amount and pattern matter more than color, sweetness, or origin over months and years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some components attract attention, including &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/healing-chronic-wounds-with-gold-and-red-wine/"&gt;resveratrol&lt;/a&gt;, a plant chemical linked to anti-inflammatory actions. Its levels vary widely by grape variety, climate, and winemaking choices that producers make annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-study-cannot-tell-us"&gt;What this study cannot tell us&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This evidence is observational, which means it tracks how people live without assigning behaviors or doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That design can leave room for confounders, hidden factors that influence both drinking and disease risk, such as income or diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A genetics based &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g4164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mendelian randomization&lt;/a&gt;, an approach that uses inherited variants as natural experiments, found that people with gene variants linked to lower alcohol intake had lower cardiovascular risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That suggests the safest choice for heart health may be drinking less rather than more in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also detected publication bias, a tendency for studies with positive results to be published more often than null findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern can overstate benefits and understate harms, especially for lifestyle research involving complex behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self reported drinking can be imprecise across time. People forget details, and that can lead to misclassification, recording habits in the wrong category, which can blur real dose response patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-defining-moderate-drinking"&gt;Defining “moderate drinking”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; say adults who choose to drink should limit intake and that drinking less is better for health than drinking more. They explain the tradeoffs plainly for people making day to day health decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also define a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/having-just-one-alcoholic-drink-every-day-linked-to-damaged-brain-vessels/"&gt;standard drink&lt;/a&gt;, 14 grams of pure alcohol, which is about 5 ounces of table wine at 12 percent alcohol by volume. Using standard drink sizes helps people count accurately and avoid accidental overconsumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many adults, moderation means up to 1 drink in a day for women and up to 2 for men. These are limits on days when alcohol is consumed, not targets to meet every day throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you don’t drink, don’t start,” said the American Heart Association in its consumer guidance, offering clear advice. Medical groups like the AHA, add an important caution for anyone weighing the risks and benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wine-advice-for-heart-health"&gt;Wine advice for heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you already drink wine, keep the serving small and the pattern steady with meals. Avoid binge drinking, which raises blood pressure and can trigger &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/alcohol-has-a-hidden-impact-on-heart-health/"&gt;heart rhythm problems&lt;/a&gt; that sometimes require urgent care visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wine and other alcoholic beverages add calories that can nudge weight and blood sugar upward over time, which isn’t great for your heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can also interact with medicines used for hypertension, diabetes, and mood disorders, so discuss your situation with a clinician during regular visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People looking for heart protection can focus on habits with strong causal evidence and broad benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular physical activity, blood pressure control, not smoking, and a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts, and fish have clear links to longer, healthier life across large studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-we-learned-about-wine-and-hearts"&gt;What we learned about wine and hearts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, swapping alcohol for a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/are-zero-alcohol-drinks-a-type-of-gateway-drug-for-teens/"&gt;nonalcoholic alternative&lt;/a&gt; removes risk while keeping a similar taste experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dealcoholized wines and grape based beverages are widely available and avoid ethanol exposure, and the cautious read is simple for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wine may fit into a healthy pattern for some adults, but it is not a prescription for heart protection or a shortcut to longevity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choices about alcohol are personal and should be made with full awareness of risks and context after considering your health status and goals carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/12/2785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 19:50:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxPYkFHZ2M4N182aWhpb2lrbFh4NGpnVzl6V2dGdjVnb2hIVnppd0txR1Vmc0tKTFU0ektReUhObG55Mm9PbHlqRUhDR0NSMkZ4alIzWmxiaXk4Q3E4UGVoX0p4bnQ5eF9GcFpLV2RuazZiTmlqSDg1a1hSaTdrY2QwUWRKV0d2WHpMQ05zSg</guid></item><item><title>年轻人应该服用肌酸吗？ -对话</title><link>https://theconversation.com/should-young-people-take-creatine-267365</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/creatine-10045"&gt;Creatine&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most widely used sports supplements across the world. It’s taken by many in the hopes of boosting strength, enhancing athletic performance and promoting muscle growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it isn’t only adults who are using this supplement. A growing number of teenagers and young adults report &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a68812063/should-teenagers-take-creatine/"&gt;taking creatine&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of reaping the supplement’s benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surveys show that as many as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6611041/"&gt;72% of male athletes&lt;/a&gt; aged 17-18 report using creatine. Use is typically &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1550-2783-5-2"&gt;more common among athletes&lt;/a&gt;, especially young men. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While creatine is generally considered to be safe for young people to use, it’s no shortcut to getting fit. It’s better for young people looking to get strong or improve their athletic performance to focus on the fundamentals: exercising, eating properly and prioritising sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Creatine is a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2021.104568"&gt;natural compound&lt;/a&gt; stored within muscle. Although a small amount is produced in the kidneys and liver, most (around 95%) is obtained from eating meat and seafood. Creatine plays an important role in providing energy during high-intensity activities, such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z"&gt;sprinting and lifting weights&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although several forms of creatine are commercially available, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu17172748"&gt;creatine monohydrate&lt;/a&gt; is the most stable and extensively studied form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies show that creatine supplementation enhances performance in high-intensity exercises requiring strength and power, such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu17172748"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; and sprinting. Creatine supplementation may also lead to more &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15092116"&gt;muscle growth&lt;/a&gt; when combined with resistance training, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13061915"&gt;faster recovery&lt;/a&gt; from exercise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging research also suggests that creatine’s benefits extend beyond the gym. Studies indicate that creatine may improve aspects of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2024.1424972"&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; – specifically memory and attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creatine also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2015.12.034"&gt;shows promise&lt;/a&gt; for older adults in preventing muscle loss and protecting against neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Creatine’s safety&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical diet that includes meat and seafood provides around &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2021.104568"&gt;1–2 grams of creatine&lt;/a&gt; per day, which keeps the muscles around 60–80% full of creatine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a daily creatine supplement eventually fills the muscles with creatine. There are two common ways to do this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quickest and most commonly studied method involves a one week loading phase. This entails taking 0.3 grams of creatine per kilogram of body weight four times a day. For example, a 75kg person would take a total of 24g of creatine per day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z/"&gt;alternative approach&lt;/a&gt;, which increases muscle creatine levels more gradually, is to take 3g of creatine per day for around 28 days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both approaches will fill muscle creatine stores. The first (loading) approach tops up creatine stores faster, which means you’ll see benefits to exercise performance faster. However, the second approach is less likely to cause temporary &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15502783.2025.2488937"&gt;gastrointestinal discomfort&lt;/a&gt; (such as bloating and diarrhoea) which are more common when using the loading approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Creatine plays an important role in providing energy during high-intensity activities.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/amino-acid-food-supplement-creatine-powder-2571334573"&gt;Erhan Inga/ Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what approach you use, taking 3-5g of creatine daily is necessary to maintain muscle creatine levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15502783.2025.2488937"&gt;Numerous studies show&lt;/a&gt; that short and long-term creatine supplementation (up to 30g a day for five years) is safe and has no ill effects on health when taken at the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15502783.2025.2488937"&gt;recommended dosages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common side-effect of creatine is weight gain as the supplement &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00157.2007"&gt;increases water retention&lt;/a&gt; in muscles. This extra water remains only as long as you’re taking creatine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Creatine and young people&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although creatine is shown to be safe and effective for adults, only a few studies have investigated the effects among children and adolescents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The available studies show that creatine &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2018.00115"&gt;appears to be safe&lt;/a&gt; for young people to use and can provide &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13020664"&gt;performance benefits&lt;/a&gt;, particularly for athletes. Most studies have only looked at the safety of a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-017-0162-2"&gt;creatine dosage&lt;/a&gt; between 0.1g and 0.3g per kg of body mass per day. As such, it’s important that any young people who choose to use creatine do not exceed this dosage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although creatine appears to be safe for children and adolescents to take, it is possible that, without proper nutrition education and supervision of dosing, they could be at risk of misusing creatine – potentially leading to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z"&gt;adverse effects&lt;/a&gt; such as stomach cramps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study that evaluated young athletes’ understanding of how sports supplements &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-019-0294-7"&gt;should be used&lt;/a&gt; reported that only 11% of the athletes answered questions correctly about creatine use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of age, it’s important to recognise that supplements such as creatine are not a shortcut to improving fitness, building muscle or losing body fat. Supplements provide much &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2025.1663860"&gt;smaller performance gains&lt;/a&gt; compared to what can be achieved through good training and nutrition alone. While sports supplements support training and recovery, significant progress comes from consistent exercise, a balanced diet and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2017.00564"&gt;adequate sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a well-designed training programme and healthy eating plan, young people will experience rapid improvements in strength, power and endurance without the need for supplements. Focusing too soon on taking supplements could &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/her/18.1.98"&gt;distract young people&lt;/a&gt; from building good training habits and healthy eating patterns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why most sport nutritionists recommend using a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2021-0335"&gt;food-first approach&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on maximising diet quality before recommending supplements such as creatine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The 10 snakes faced a tough predicament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collected from the Colombian Amazon, they had been without food for several days in captivity and then were presented with extremely unappetizing prey: three-striped poison dart frogs, &lt;em&gt;Ameerega trivittata&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The skin of those frogs contains deadly toxins – such as histrionicotoxins, pumiliotoxins, and decahydroquinolines – that interfere with essential cell proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six of the royal ground snakes (&lt;em&gt;Erythrolamprus reginae&lt;/em&gt;) preferred to go hungry. The other four intrepidly slithered in for the kill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before swallowing their meals, they dragged the frogs across the ground – akin to the way some birds rub toxins off their prey, noted biologist &lt;a href="https://dlab.berkeley.edu/people/valeria-ram%C3%ADrez-casta%C3%B1eda"&gt;Valeria Ramírez Castañeda&lt;/a&gt; of the University of California, Berkeley, and her colleagues, who conducted the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/slow-motion-video-shows-snake-bites-live-youve-never-seen-them-before"&gt;Slow-Motion Video Shows Snake Bites Like You've Never Seen Them Before&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of the four snakes survived the meal – suggesting that their bodies were &lt;a href="https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/view/9403/"&gt;capable of handling the toxins that remained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living beings have been wielding deadly molecules to kill each other for hundreds of millions of years. First came microbes that used the chemicals to weed out competitors or attack host cells they were invading; then animals, to kill prey or ward off predators, and plants, to defend against herbivores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, many animals have evolved ways to survive these toxins. They sometimes even store them to use against opponents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are beginning to unravel these creative antitoxin defenses and hope as a result to identify better treatments for poisonings in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More fundamentally, they're learning about a force that has quietly helped to shape biological communities, says evolutionary biologist &lt;a href="https://ib.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/tarvinr"&gt;Rebecca Tarvin&lt;/a&gt; of UC Berkeley, who helped supervise the snake experiment and wrote about such strategies in the 2023 &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-102320-102117"&gt;Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just milligrams of a single compound, and that can change all of the interactions in an ecosystem," Tarvin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Biological warfare&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Species become toxic in a variety of ways. Some of them make the toxins themselves: Bufonid toads, for instance, produce molecules called cardiac glycosides that stop a protein called the sodium-potassium pump from shunting ions in and out of cells. Such shunting is critical to maintaining cell volume, contracting muscles, and transmitting nerve impulses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other animals house toxin-producing bacteria in their bodies – that's the case for puffer fish, whose tetrodotoxin-containing flesh can prove lethal to consume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And many others get their toxins through food – examples are &lt;a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2023/mysteries-poisonous-amphibians"&gt;poison frogs&lt;/a&gt;, which devour toxin-containing insects and mites; those frogs include the species that was fed to the ground snakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As some animals evolved to become toxic, they also rewired their bodies to avoid poisoning themselves. The same thing happened to creatures they eat, or that eat them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best studied of these adaptations involves &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1511706112"&gt;changes to the proteins that are normally disabled by the toxins&lt;/a&gt;, so that they're now resistant. For example, insects that grow and feed on glycoside-rich milkweed plants have &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/eea.12340"&gt;evolved sodium-potassium pumps&lt;/a&gt; that the glycoside cannot bind to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;But changing a vital molecule can create complications for a creature, says molecular biologist &lt;a href="https://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/forschung/molekulare-evolutionsbiologie/mitarbeiter/m-dobler/dobler-susanne.html"&gt;Susanne Dobler&lt;/a&gt; of Hamburg University in Germany. In her studies with the large milkweed bug, which feeds on milkweed seeds, she's found that the more glycoside-resistant the pump becomes, the less efficient it is. And that's a problem in nerve cells, where the pump is especially critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bug seems to have evolved a way around the problem. In a 2023 study, Dobler and colleagues studied toxin resistance across &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.17041"&gt;three versions of the pump&lt;/a&gt; made by the creature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They learned that the most functional one, in the brain, is also the most toxin-sensitive one. The milkweed bug must have evolved other ways to safeguard the brain from glycosides, Dobler says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179353" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179353" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/milkweed_bug_642.jpg" alt="milkweed bug" class="wp-image-179353 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/milkweed_bug_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/milkweed_bug_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179353" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The large milkweed bug feeds and lives on plants that contain deadly cardiac glycosides. (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_milkweed_bug#/media/File:Large_milkweed_bug_(23188).jpg"&gt;Rhododendrites/Wikimedia Commons/CC-BY-SA 4.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dobler suspects that proteins called ABCB transporters are involved: These sit in cell membranes and shunt waste and other unwanted products out of cells. She has found that certain hawk moths &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2012.3089"&gt;use ABCB transporter proteins&lt;/a&gt; situated around their nerve tissues to shuttle cardiac glycosides out of cells. Maybe the milkweed bug is doing something similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dobler is also testing a hypothesis that many insects have ABCB transporters in the membranes of their guts, stopping toxic substances from getting into the body to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could explain how the bright red onion beetle, which feeds on glycoside-rich lily of the valley, is seemingly unfazed by the toxins and merely excretes them. The resulting feces &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10886-023-01465-8"&gt;have the benefit of repelling predatory ants&lt;/a&gt;, Dobler reported in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the royal ground snakes, the liver seems to be key. From cell culture experiments, Tarvin's team has evidence that something in snake liver extract protects against toxins of three-striped poison dart frogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team hypothesizes that the snakes have enzymes that convert the deadly substances into nontoxic forms, much as human bodies do with alcohol and nicotine. Snake liver may also contain proteins that stick to toxins and render them unable to bind to their targets – mopping them up like sponges.&lt;br&gt;

Ground squirrel blood contains proteins that block some of these toxins – like the proteins rattlers use themselves for protection should venom escape their specialized venom glands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The composition of venom &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2015.2841"&gt;differs across snake populations&lt;/a&gt;, and evolutionary biologist &lt;a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/eeb/people/affiliates/venomatt.html"&gt;Matthew Holding&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Michigan has evidence that the ground squirrels' antivenom mix is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34322920/"&gt;tailored to match local snakes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such defenses aren't bulletproof. Rattlesnakes are constantly evolving new venom to overcome the squirrels' defenses, Holding says, and even a rattler will die if injected with enough of its own venom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why animals, even resistant ones, try, as a first defensive step, to avoid toxins. Hence the dragging behavior of ground snakes, and the practice of some turtles to &lt;a href="https://www.periodicos.capes.gov.br/index.php/acervo/buscador.html?task=detalhes&amp;amp;id=W2324013247"&gt;consume only the belly skin and innards of toxic newts, not the deadly back skin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even insects like &lt;a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2019/monarch-butterflies-milkyweed-toxin"&gt;monarch caterpillars&lt;/a&gt; that are resistant to cardiac glycosides will nick the veins of milkweed plants to drain out the toxic fluid before tucking into the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Co-opting toxins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many animals also find ways to safely store toxic chemicals they consume and use them for their own purposes. The iridescent dogbane beetle, for example, gets cardiac glycosides from its host plants and then – &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2020.1311"&gt;probably via ABCB transporters&lt;/a&gt; – shuttles them onto its back for self-defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you somehow annoy these beetles, you can see little droplets appear on their elytra, their dorsal surface," Dobler says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through this kind of poison coopting, some insects become dependent on their host plants for survival. The relationship between the &lt;a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2018/monarchs-stupendous-migration-dissected"&gt;monarch butterfly&lt;/a&gt; and the milkweed plant is a prime example – and a prime example, too, of the long reach that such intertwined connections may have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2021 study, evolutionary biologist and geneticist &lt;a href="https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/noah-whiteman"&gt;Noah Whiteman&lt;/a&gt; of UC Berkeley and his colleague identified four animals that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34813747/"&gt;have evolved to tolerate cardiac glycosides&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to feed on monarchs. One is the black-headed grosbeak, a bird that feasts on monarchs in Mexico's mountaintop fir forests where the butterflies fly south to overwinter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of it, Whiteman says: A toxin that was assembled in a milkweed plant on an Ontario prairie has helped to shape the biology of a bird so that it may safely dine in a forest thousands of miles away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's just amazing," he says – "the journey traveled by this small molecule, and the influence that it has on evolution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This &lt;a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2025/animals-deal-with-toxins"&gt;article originally appeared&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/"&gt;Knowable Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit publication dedicated to making scientific knowledge accessible to all. &lt;a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/newsletter-signup"&gt;Sign up for Knowable Magazine's newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
