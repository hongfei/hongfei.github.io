The strain emerged last summer, too late for it to be included in the 2025-2026 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-db51aa" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is unexpected good news,” said Scott Hensley, professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania. “Although it’s not a complete match with what’s circulating, this vaccine appears to have the capacity to produce antibodies that will likely provide protection,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6a5bb7" class="body-graf"&gt;The Penn Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response takes an early look every year at how well the seasonal flu shot prompts an antibody response in the immune system. That is, how likely the shot is to offer measurable protection for most people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1857c9" class="body-graf"&gt;This year's findings were &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.01.05.26343449v1" target="_blank"&gt;released Tuesday night&lt;/a&gt; on the preprint server medRxiv, a site that publishes research before it’s gone through an extensive and rigorous peer-review process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f28e2a" class="body-graf"&gt;The&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;current flu shot protects against three flu strains: two A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and one B strain. Last June, however, after vaccine production had begun, H3N2 changed slightly. This raised concerns that the shots would be a poor match. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-82454a" class="body-graf"&gt;In October and November, the researchers analyzed blood samples taken from 76 people, ages 24 to 81. One blood draw occurred just before they got the flu shot. A second sample was taken about a month later, giving the vaccine ample time to mount a defense against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-251e04" class="body-graf"&gt;Before getting the shot, 39% of the study participants had antibodies against H3N2, likely because they’d already been exposed to the virus. That percentage nearly doubled after the vaccine, to 71%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7df6e0" class="body-graf"&gt;The effect was even more striking when researchers looked specifically at how the shot worked against the shifted H3N2 strain, subclade K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ffa22a" class="body-graf"&gt;Before the shot, just 11% had antibodies against subclade K. That percentage nearly quadrupled after the shot, to 39%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0c8bc5" class="body-graf"&gt;The results held regardless of the study participants’ ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2445c0" class="body-graf"&gt;Doctor visits for flu-like symptoms have hit the highest levels for this time of year in nearly three decades. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html" target="_blank"&gt;latest data&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 1 in 10 outpatient doctors’ visits were for flu symptoms as of Dec. 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-745c88" class="body-graf"&gt;Although people who are vaccinated sometimes still get infected with flu, their symptoms tend to be much milder compared to people who aren’t vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bf216a" class="body-graf"&gt;“This confirms the vaccine still can offer better protection against H3N2 than if you were unvaccinated,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. “The mismatch may not be as impactful as everyone feared.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cbfb91" class="body-graf"&gt;Bill Hanage, a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said, “It’s more evidence that the current vaccine might not be perfect, but it’s still more than good enough to provide protection, especially when it comes to stopping serious illness.” Neither Hanage nor Rasmussen were involved with the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-23932e" class="body-graf"&gt;Flu strains are “master shapeshifters,” Hensley said. That’s partly why it’s so difficult to get the vaccine to match the exact strains each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7f981b" class="body-graf"&gt;The findings may be of particular importance given the record high number of pediatric flu deaths reported last season, Hanage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-df46ff" class="body-graf"&gt;On Monday, the CDC reported an additional death of a child last season, bringing the total to 289, eclipsing even the number of pediatric deaths from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7709fc" class="body-graf"&gt;Although the Department of Health this week announced it would no longer recommend annual flu shots for children, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/2025-2026.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC website&lt;/a&gt; states that “everyone 6 months and older, with rare exceptions, should get a flu vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-014d0e" class="body-graf"&gt;As of Dec. 27, the percentage of kids who’ve gotten their flu shot this year was 42.5%. That’s the lowest recorded by the end of December since at least 2019, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/children-vaccination-coverage.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC records&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-378548" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Vaccines won’t do any good if people don’t get them. It’s not too late,” Rasmussen said. “Everyone reading should take this news as a reminder to get a flu shot if you haven’t already.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 17:43:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPN2VNY1dHVVJtdVItUXgxWk41a0psazhEUjg3UmYwN1BZbTR4alMtdjk5OU1jOWVvS0Jta3J5SzZKZFdDQ3lkUURQWHAwQ2NzVlllbnBTVkxRU2NhcnpnSkdCbDhmUm1taHN2WU9FZUdzdlZqVDNZSW15b0U3aGFWUnVRczBOTlk0dGlIU3lpZmlBSnZNUXhudldra1hrQ3pJeVVrb9IBVkFVX3lxTE5IeDZvNlVuSTVscXYzSzBsZ2F1MUJDSUdaWXkyVDVkVHFZdlZjWTBVWHI2SXRoSmx3M3ZUallSUFU5aF9vMmQzN1NBQlR3bnUwWktPTHJB</guid></item><item><title>我是否患有“超级流感” ？以下是您需要了解的信息- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/do-i-have-the-super-flu-heres-what-you-need-to-know-2000706754</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This winter is playing host to an especially bad flu season in the United States—one that might leave you with plenty of worries and questions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most pressing concern, especially for those of us starting to feel under the weather, might be: how do you know when you’re sick with the flu, or even the so-called “super” flu?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cold vs flu&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many germs out there that can cause respiratory illness. That said, most of these tend to be viruses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What we call the common cold is actually an assortment of many viruses—over 200 in total—that can all cause a respiratory infection. The flu, meanwhile, is only caused by the influenza virus, though there are many different types of influenza circulating around the world at any given time (including influenza viruses that usually sicken other animals, like birds).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Though colds and flus do share some similarities, there are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/coldflu.html"&gt;real differences&lt;/a&gt; between them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colds are generally upper respiratory infections, meaning they’re isolated to your nose, throat, and sinuses. They usually cause symptoms like a runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, cough, and sneezing. Miserable as a cold can feel, these symptoms tend to gradually develop, are relatively mild in intensity, and clear up within a week.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Typically, flus also cause upper respiratory infections. But as anyone who’s had it can tell you, the flu often hits harder and more abruptly than a cold. So your throat might feel especially raw if you have a flu. The flu also commonly causes systemic symptoms like fever, body aches, and fatigue. And a flu will stick around longer on average, sometimes up to two weeks. Flu is also more likely to spread deeper into the lower respiratory tract, where it can trigger more severe and even life-threatening complications like pneumonia and bronchitis.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There are nuances to all this. Some germs, like the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), can cause a cold in most people but are more likely to cause &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/chest-lungs/Pages/RSV-When-Its-More-Than-Just-a-Cold.aspx"&gt;severe illness&lt;/a&gt; in vulnerable groups like very young children than others, for instance. And even generally mild cold viruses can &lt;a href="https://www.mhealthfairview.org/blog/when-can-a-cold-become-serious"&gt;occasionally&lt;/a&gt; cause lower respiratory infections.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As a general rule, though, if your respiratory illness isn’t knocking you completely off your feet, you’re probably not having the flu.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What about the super flu?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This flu season is being driven by a particular variant of H3N2 flu, known as subclade K.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;H3N2 flus tend to cause a &lt;a href="https://www.acsh.org/news/2018/01/02/some-bad-flu-news-h3n2-major-player-year-12350"&gt;bit more misery&lt;/a&gt; than other seasonal flu viruses. But K is all the more worrying because it emerged unexpectedly last year and is noticeably different on a genetic level from the strains that scientists predicted would be circulating right now. As a result, the seasonal flu vaccine is mismatched to K, reducing its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The good news is that K isn’t appearing to cause more severe illness on average than other H3N2 viruses. But its arrival does seem to have fueled unusual waves of flu around the world. In some countries like Australia, it &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12701333/"&gt;prolonged&lt;/a&gt; the flu season; in others like the UK, it helped start the season &lt;a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.46.2500854#html_fulltext"&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt;. And in the U.S., it’s contributed to record levels of flu this winter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; Monday shows that doctors’ visits for flu-like illness last week were the &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/doctor-visits-for-flu-hit-highest-level-in-almost-30-years/"&gt;highest ever recorded&lt;/a&gt; in the country since modern tracking began almost 30 years ago. The CDC also estimates that the flu has sickened 11 million people, hospitalized 120,000, and killed 5,000 so far this season. And it’s likely that flu activity will remain high for several more weeks at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Many flu diagnostic tests, either the kind you get at your doctor’s office or take at home, will identify the broad type of influenza you have (A or B). Some might even identify the strain, such as H3N2. Scientists can also conduct further testing to diagnose a specific variant, but these results are used by local and federal health officials to track flu trends and aren’t widely available to the public.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given that and the fact that subclade K isn’t worse than the average flu, you’ll probably never know for sure if K is to blame for your flu infection. That said, the chances &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; pretty good it is.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, nearly all tested samples reported last week by public health labs came back positive for H3N2 (91%). And of all the H3N2 samples further tested by the CDC since last September, about 90% were identified as subclade K.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mismatched as it is to subclade K, the flu vaccine is still providing some level of protection against seasonal flu, data from the UK has &lt;a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.46.2500854#html_fulltext:~:text=Despite%20the%20emergence,cohorts%20%5B26%5D."&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt;. So it’s still worthwhile to get your shot. Other precautions like regularly washing your hands and wearing masks can lower your risk of catching the flu as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Best of luck out there.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

Effective forms of &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/crispr-flu-antivirals/"&gt;treating or preventing colds&lt;/a&gt; have proven hard to come by, with the majority of over-the-counter medicines &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ocean/aap/2018/00000039/00000003/art00005" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ocean/aap/2018/00000039/00000003/art00005"}' href="https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ocean/aap/2018/00000039/00000003/art00005" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;yielding modest results&lt;/a&gt;; it’s hard to devise a drug that tackles the vast array of viral pathogens that cause them. The need for better respiratory protection during the winter months is clear. It might be found in a practice that dates back thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The concept of saline nasal irrigation, or bathing the nasal passages with a saltwater solution, is &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2009/1115/p1117.html" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2009/1115/p1117.html"}' href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2009/1115/p1117.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;thought to have been&lt;/a&gt; introduced as part of Ayurveda, an alternative medicine system that originated in the Indian subcontinent more than 5,000 years ago. Now, modern science is beginning to demonstrate that this ancient practice really does serve as a surprisingly effective shield against many of the seasonal bugs behind the common cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(24)00140-1/fulltext"&gt;a major new study&lt;/a&gt; of nearly 14,000 people funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research in the UK found that using a simple saline-based nasal spray between three and six times a day at the first sign of an infection reduced illness duration by around 20 percent.

During the early stages of the Covid pandemic, many health care professionals dismissed the suggestion that saline nasal irrigation might be able to prevent infections. The technique was &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10312243/"&gt;initially listed&lt;/a&gt; among other debunked therapies on the World Health Organization’s Covid myth buster page, before being later removed as a steady trickle of research began to prove that regular use of saline sprays or irrigation really could limit the effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01455613221123737"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; found that people who practiced saline nasal irrigation for two weeks after testing positive for Covid were more than eight times less likely to be hospitalized, leading to a resurgence of interest among doctors regarding its ability to dampen the effects of other seasonal infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Clinicians and researchers have started paying increasing attention to saline nasal irrigation because it helps, and it is natural, easy to understand care,” says David Rábago, a physician and professor at Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine. “So far the results of many small studies and a few big ones are that saline nasal irrigation is safe and effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;As well as blocking viral replication within nasal cells, it appears that saline can increase the activity of a group of white blood cells called neutrophils—which help to fight off pathogens—while also enhancing the ability of mucus to encircle and trap viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“When perfectly hydrated, the mucus cells make a barrier and envelop a virus, so that you can either swallow it where the [stomach] acid degrades it, or cough it up,” says Amy Baxter, a pediatrician and assistant clinical professor in medicine at Augusta University. “It’s kind of like how soap works; it surrounds the dirt and makes it easier for it to come off because it fully envelopes these little particles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:18:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9PMmhjazdKTlRYVHRpMkp2bjlkVFhWRElwU1NOWGdXNTZ0Y25uRDJ6Zk9lWXNxZ1IyUVhQdWRPN0pLOHRHbHlQSEpSTWRkZ2lldWZtRXF4NlpQWGhjNU9sMEE5ZzNaZ0hjc2ZqdzNCNkpta3c</guid></item><item><title>肯尼迪改革儿童疫苗背后的大计划-Politico</title><link>https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/07/the-big-plan-behind-kennedys-overhaul-of-childhood-vaccines-00713852</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Politico</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:02:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxNbXlMZU04czhidURaZjR1THBOSXhScWcxTV9QOXd0TmtXeWUxOXlHMllwQ0p3VkIzTVJmQWlBZXFCZEItRHJvUm5aLTlwX09oalVlZTRqVURyRUdYRDVyS1NuaVBrQUlWY3laYzREVEhCVFlrNWJINzlMU1JOZFlHUWZaS29uaVlvVnFHRU1BbnpLbHZNR25qMXJlbjVPRHNVa1JSR21lUjJHcnd4U1E</guid></item><item><title>早期补充：如何在寒冷时避免感冒-哥谭市主义者</title><link>https://gothamist.com/news/early-addition-how-to-avoid-a-cold-when-its-cold</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-donation-CTA"&gt;&lt;p class="h6"&gt;We rely on your support to make local news available to all&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="type-textlink2 no-underline"&gt; Make your contribution now and help Gothamist thrive in 2026. &lt;a to="https://pledge.wnyc.org/support/gothamist/?utm_medium=partnersite&amp;amp;utm_source=gothamist&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article-top" target="_blank" raw="false" rawhover="none" class="author-name flexible-link external author-name" href="https://pledge.wnyc.org/support/gothamist/?utm_medium=partnersite&amp;amp;utm_source=gothamist&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article-top" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; Donate today &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 15:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxOT3Utek9xeUZDdFB6SHZtdFQ2anlsdlF6dldjdGU1cFMxY0hHeHlpQi00TGN1OGVpNVpUYXhzb0VfM1lPOUNHQTQwQjFlSDhjUXV0TFlNVkJpU21XaldDVE5weE1kOFNWcWpvXzNMVS1nNkVDSmNTLW5wOUlsTndsYQ</guid></item><item><title>疫苗开发的黄金时代-工作正在进行中</title><link>https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-golden-age-of-vaccine-development/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1796, when Edward Jenner developed the first vaccine, against the smallpox virus, no one knew what viruses were, let alone connected them to diseases. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/A_History_of_Immunology/2xNYjigte14C?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;pg=PA18&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=depletion"&gt;believed&lt;/a&gt; Jenner’s vaccine worked because it depleted the body of the specific nutrients the disease needed to thrive. In reality, his concept worked because of the good fortune that cowpox infections &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952791509000922"&gt;provided cross protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup class="article-reference" id="ref-1"&gt;&lt;button&gt;1&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; against smallpox. It would take almost a century to work out how to develop vaccines against other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://worksinprogress.co/print" class="magazine-cta-inline button-magazine-hover-group"&gt;&lt;img src="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WIP-Cover-Layered-02-1702x1995.png" class="magazine-cta-inline__image"&gt;&lt;div class="magazine-cta-inline__main"&gt;&lt;p class="magazine-cta-inline__title"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Get the print magazine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="magazine-cta-inline__divider"&gt;&lt;div class="magazine-cta-inline__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subscribe for $100 to receive six beautiful issues per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="magazine-cta-inline__button"&gt;Subscribe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stocks of Jenner’s vaccine would &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-1339-5_2"&gt;die out&lt;/a&gt; repeatedly, and needed to be rederived from scratch many times. Keeping a vaccine alive in the nineteenth century was grueling, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X2030668X"&gt;requiring arm to arm chains of transmission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup class="article-reference" id="ref-2"&gt;&lt;button&gt;2&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; just to preserve the material.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The process improved slowly. In the 1840s, doctors invented a method to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X2030668X"&gt;grow the smallpox vaccine virus more safely and reliably on the skin of calves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup class="article-reference" id="ref-3"&gt;&lt;button&gt;3&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The 1890s saw a method to keep it from spoiling quickly by &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X2030668X"&gt;mixing it with glycerin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4939-2383-0_1"&gt;in the 1940s&lt;/a&gt;, scientists learned how to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X2030668X"&gt;freeze-dry&lt;/a&gt; it to survive heat and long journeys. In the 1960s, the bifurcated needle, with a forked tip that could hold a tiny drop of vaccine, made it possible to use &lt;a href="https://www.zero-pox.info/bigredbook/BigRed_Ch11.pdf"&gt;only a quarter&lt;/a&gt; of the usual dose and helped scale up vaccination. Technological innovations like these made it possible to eradicate smallpox worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jenner’s discovery in the eighteenth century transformed the world. But it also reflected the primitive knowledge and technology of the time. It would take another 90 years for scientists to formulate germ theory. Another half century would pass before Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll invented the electron microscope, allowing scientists to see the virus that caused smallpox for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two hundred years ago, vaccines were serendipitous; today, they are designed. We can now visualize the structure of pathogens at an atomic level. We can purify and design ingredients, boost our immune response with adjuvants, deliver vaccines in safer packages, and manufacture them in billions of doses. We can track pathogens’ evolution in real time and adapt vaccines to new strains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It has never been easier to develop new vaccines. We are living through a golden age of vaccine development. The future holds even greater breakthroughs, but only if we continue to invest in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pasteur and the culture of vaccinology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The smallpox vaccine was serendipitous. It just happened to be the case that a related virus, cowpox, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952791509000922"&gt;could protect against smallpox&lt;/a&gt; and that cowpox was mild enough to be used safely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ninety years after Jenner, Louis Pasteur worked out how to replicate his success for other diseases. Pasteur was already famous for his &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/1097-0061%2820000615%2916%3A8%3C755%3A%3AAID-YEA587%3E3.0.CO%3B2-4"&gt;fermentation&lt;/a&gt; techniques and developing the process now called &lt;a href="https://digital.sciencehistory.org/works/5tiuqnz"&gt;pasteurization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the 1870s, he began to study infections in farm animals, starting with chicken cholera.&lt;sup class="article-reference" id="ref-4"&gt;&lt;button&gt;4&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He grew the bacteria in the lab and kept them alive via ‘serial passage’, transferring them to fresh broth every few days, and injecting them into chickens to study the disease. Fresh cultures were &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2264103/pdf/brmedj05026-0035.pdf"&gt;lethal&lt;/a&gt;: nearly all the chickens died within days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the summer of 1879, while Pasteur was away, &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23328363"&gt;his assistant Émile Roux continued the work&lt;/a&gt;. Roux tried reculturing flasks that had stood for weeks, but the broth had soured, and the bacteria grew poorly. He then injected it into chickens and noted that some survived. Perhaps the bacteria had become too weak to cause disease? But surprisingly, when he injected the same chickens with a fresh, deadly strain, some survived; it had somehow protected them. When Pasteur returned, they continued experimenting, gradually learning that acidity and prolonged exposure to air could weaken the microbe and protect the chickens. With this, they &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2264103/pdf/brmedj05026-0035.pdf"&gt;developed&lt;/a&gt; the world’s second vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then they developed another, against animal anthrax, this time &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23332044?seq=6"&gt;inactivating the bacteria with chemicals&lt;/a&gt;, before turning to one of the deadliest diseases: rabies. Almost everyone who developed symptoms from a rabid animal’s bite died within weeks, but its microbial cause was unclear. The rabies virus, like other viruses, was too small to be seen under microscopes of the time. But Pasteur and Roux reliably found that brain tissue from a rabid animal could cause rabies in another animal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After hundreds of experiments, they finally developed a vaccine. Roux &lt;a href="https://www.columbia.edu/itc/history/rothman/COL476C4947.pdf"&gt;extracted&lt;/a&gt; brain tissue from a rabid dog and injected it into the brains of rabbits after drilling a small hole into their skulls. He then passaged the material from rabbit to rabbit this way, eventually going through 90 rabbits in a row. Finally, he dried the tissues in closed flasks to weaken the pathogen and injected the material into dogs, gradually exposing them to higher and higher doses, helping them build up protection.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the animal experiments seemed successful, Pasteur and Roux &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-1339-5_6"&gt;moved to treat people&lt;/a&gt; who had been bitten by rabid animals, helping their bodies build up antibodies before the disease could fully take hold. In 1885, they treated two young boys bitten by rabid dogs and saw their first indications that the procedure worked. One of the deadliest diseases had become preventable. Rabies would eventually be &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/around-world/index.html"&gt;eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in many countries with vaccines built on their idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their methods could be used to develop vaccines systematically. One way was to force a pathogen into a different environment until it lost its virulence (‘&lt;a href="https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/glossary/live-attenuated"&gt;attenuation&lt;/a&gt;’); another was to use heat or chemicals to inactivate the pathogen (‘&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7189890/"&gt;inactivation&lt;/a&gt;’). Both prevented pathogens from causing disease in humans while preserving their structure, so the immune system could recognize a similar pathogen in the event of future exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But protecting large populations was still a distant prospect. Pasteur developed vaccines by culturing microbes in whole animals, which was inefficient and &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-74854-2_2"&gt;carried contamination risks&lt;/a&gt;. It was essential to find a way to cultivate cells – not entire tissues or animals – in a lab.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Robert Koch, a bacteriologist and Pasteur’s rival, would make a major advance. While Pasteur fermented microbes in liquid broth, Koch wanted to cultivate bacteria on solid media to see them under the microscope. His solution was to &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1128/9781555818272.ch11"&gt;solidify nutrient broth in a dish with gelatin&lt;/a&gt; and cover it with a bell jar. The gelatin was later replaced by agar (a jelly-like material derived from seaweed) and the bell jar was &lt;a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/210666#page/313/mode/1up"&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; with an additional lidded dish in an invention by his assistant Julius Petri, creating what is now known as the ‘Petri dish’. Paired with Pasteur’s methods, tools like these helped support a wave of research and the development of new bacterial vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But scientists still couldn’t cultivate animal cells. They &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-74854-2_1"&gt;clumped together&lt;/a&gt; on a plate, ran out of nutrients, and quickly died. And as viruses are &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-1108-7_9"&gt;obligate parasites&lt;/a&gt;, requiring living cells to replicate, they couldnʼt be cultivated this way at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next step forward came from neuroscientist &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.1090010503"&gt;Ross Harrison in 1907&lt;/a&gt;, who developed the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3516892/"&gt;hanging drop method&lt;/a&gt;. He took a piece of spinal cord from a frog embryo and put it in a drop of its plasma, placed it on a thin glass coverslip, inverted it over a concave slide, and sealed it with wax – creating a drop that hung suspended and stayed moist and rounded while the plasma provided nutrients and structure. The nerve fibers stayed alive, &lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/589f6511db29d6b160f930bc/t/5cba8f7255b7eb00016c8928/1555730294568/Harrison%2C+1910.pdf"&gt;growing for weeks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the 1920s, scientists were isolating cells from tissue, watching them migrate across glass surfaces and, once they had used up the nutrients on a plate, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1082475/"&gt;cutting the growing regions&lt;/a&gt; and transferring them onto a new plate, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3516892/"&gt;creating longer lineages of cells&lt;/a&gt;. Such methods helped develop &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/enders-robbins-weller-lecture.pdf"&gt;vaccines against diseases like polio&lt;/a&gt; as scientists figured out &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1676381"&gt;how to propagate poliovirus&lt;/a&gt; in cells outside the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additional &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-74854-2_1"&gt;technologies&lt;/a&gt; made the process safer: antibiotics reduced bacterial contamination, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoclave"&gt;autoclaves&lt;/a&gt; sterilized instruments with high-pressure steam. Later, cryopreservation helped freeze cells for long term storage, and animal broths were replaced with simpler preparations like &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1751011?seq=3"&gt;Harry Eagle’s medium&lt;/a&gt;, which contained only glucose, amino acids, salts, and vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers also developed machinery to grow cells. For cells that typically grew suspended in liquid, there were &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioreactor"&gt;stirred-tank bioreactors&lt;/a&gt;, which bubble in oxygen and stir the solution to distribute nutrients. For those that still required a surface, there were &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcarrier"&gt;microcarriers&lt;/a&gt;, with tiny beads suspended in liquid, and the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.91.2354.148"&gt;roller bottle system&lt;/a&gt;, where glass bottles rotate slowly to increase cells’ surface area while keeping them evenly bathed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccinology had become a systematic science, based ultimately on the foundations laid by Pasteur. By the mid-twentieth century, scientists were producing vaccines against typhoid fever, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, influenza, polio, yellow fever, and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;The microscope revolution&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What was remarkable about Pasteur’s approach was that he developed some vaccines without ever observing the pathogens, through empirical testing alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t strictly necessary to see pathogens to develop vaccines for them, but observation made others possible. Take tuberculosis, whose symptoms are easy to confuse with other diseases. The bacteria that cause it were eventually identified through microscopy. Without such careful examination, it would have been difficult to cultivate the right bacteria and remove other contaminating microbes from a vaccine preparation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/companionencyclo0001unse_i6n9"&gt;microscopes had been undergoing a revolution&lt;/a&gt; of their own. Over two hundred years, their resolution would improve more than ten thousandfold, allowing scientists to examine not only cells, but bacteria, then viruses, their protein structure, and, eventually, the individual atoms that comprised them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 1800, the French anatomist Xavier Bichat had &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/traitdesmembra1816bich/page/n5/mode/2up"&gt;classified the body into&lt;/a&gt; groups of similar cells, like muscle or connective tissue, using only a hand lens. Bichat &lt;a href="https://numerabilis.u-paris.fr/partenaires/chn/docpdf/generality.pdf"&gt;distrusted&lt;/a&gt; nineteenth century compound microscopes, probably for good reason. Many apparent discoveries of the time were actually caused by &lt;a href="https://microscope-antiques.com/hxachromatic.html"&gt;optical problems&lt;/a&gt; like spherical aberration, where the edges of a curved lens bent light differently than the center and made images blurry, or chromatic aberration, where different wavelengths were bent differently and created colored fringes around objects. What looked like a cellular feature might simply be a distorted lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various innovations were needed to make microscopes more precise. One step came in 1830 from the wine merchant JJ Lister, who studied lens making as a hobby.&lt;sup class="article-reference" id="ref-5"&gt;&lt;button&gt;5&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; By varying the distance between lenses, &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rstl.1830.0015"&gt;he worked out&lt;/a&gt; how to develop achromatic and aplanatic lenses, which reduced color and spherical aberrations, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Improvements continued, along with new techniques to view more biological material for longer and with greater detail. Scientists developed &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/principlesofbiol01bake"&gt;better fixatives&lt;/a&gt; to stabilize cells and prevent them from decaying, &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/principlesofbiol01bake"&gt;staining dyes&lt;/a&gt; that bind to molecules to reveal structures like the cell nucleus, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtome"&gt;sectioning equipment&lt;/a&gt;, which cut tissue into thin slices to allow light through.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the nineteenth century progressed, scientists began to see cells’ organelles and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11180163/"&gt;observe cell division&lt;/a&gt;. They increasingly recognized cells as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncb0599_E13"&gt;the units that all living organisms are made of&lt;/a&gt;. And with improvements in culture methods, they observed microorganisms – bacteria, fungi, and parasites – infecting cells and causing disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most famous was the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt;, discovered &lt;a href="https://germanhistory-intersections.org/en/knowledge-and-education/ghis:document-25"&gt;by Robert Koch in 1882&lt;/a&gt;, at a time when tuberculosis was killing &lt;a href="https://edoc.rki.de/handle/176904/5172"&gt;thousands&lt;/a&gt; each year in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829299000295"&gt;growing cities&lt;/a&gt; like Berlin. Before Koch, researchers had managed to &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/community.24801815"&gt;reproduce&lt;/a&gt; tuberculosis in rabbits by injecting them with phlegm from infected patients, but struggled to identify its microbial cause. Although they didn’t know it, the bacteria’s waxy cell walls, rich in mycolic acids, repelled water-based dyes, making the bacteria difficult to stain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Visualizing them would take ingenuity. Taking lung tissue from an autopsy, Koch applied standard dyes and then added &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1128/9781555818272.ch14"&gt;ammonia&lt;/a&gt;, making the solution more alkaline. It made it possible for the dyes to attach to the bacteria, and as the dyes latched on, they revealed, at last, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14600233/"&gt;the pathogen responsible&lt;/a&gt; for one of humanity’s greatest killers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His discovery was part of a surge of research in microbiology in the late nineteenth century, now known as the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971210023143"&gt;golden age of microbiology&lt;/a&gt;. One by one, long standing mysteries of diseases – tuberculosis, cholera, typhoid, anthrax, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, meningococcal and pneumococcal disease – were being resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No viruses had yet been observed: they were still invisible under the microscope, being much smaller than bacteria. Unfortunately, by the end of the nineteenth century, improvements in microscopy were reaching a hard limit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The physicist and businessman Ernst Abbe had &lt;a href="https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/221236/1/Peckham_2024_J._Phys.__Conf._Ser._2877_012091.pdf"&gt;formulated an equation&lt;/a&gt; that would explain why. He found that a microscope’s optical resolution depended on the wavelength of light and the numerical aperture of the lens (a measure of its ability to gather light). Light microscopes couldn’t focus at high magnification because, no matter how clear the lenses were, they couldn’t distinguish details closer than about half the wavelength of visible light, roughly two hundred nanometers. When two points were closer together, light waves directed at them would interfere, blurring them into a single spot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It would take until the 1930s for physicists Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll to &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/ruska-lecture.pdf"&gt;invent&lt;/a&gt; the electron microscope, replacing light with electrons, which have a smaller wavelength, and extend this limit. Their invention required &lt;a href="https://api.pageplace.de/preview/DT0400.9781483284651_A23884248/preview-9781483284651_A23884248.pdf"&gt;various advances&lt;/a&gt;: discovering the electron, inventing magnetic lenses, and improving vacuum technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Electron microscopy combined them all. Electrons can’t be bent by glass the way light can, so electron microscopes instead use magnetic lenses: coils of wire carrying current that bend and focus the electron beam. To keep the electrons from scattering off, the instrument operates in a vacuum. The pieces work in &lt;a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/blog/atomic-resolution/seeing-with-electrons-the-anatomy-of-an-electron-microscope/"&gt;stages&lt;/a&gt;: a source produces the electron beam; a condenser aperture shapes it; magnetic lenses focus it progressively onto a specimen; and more lenses project and magnify the image onto a detector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first electron microscopes were fragile prototypes. Improving the vacuum seal, brightening the beam, sharpening the lenses, and using better cameras led to an enormous payoff: magnification thousands of times greater than light microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electron microscopy gave microbiologists their &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-virology-100520-014520"&gt;first direct look at viruses&lt;/a&gt;, finally revealing their geometry. But the electron beam could &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/advanced-chemistryprize2017.pdf"&gt;collapse&lt;/a&gt; biological material like proteins and membranes, leaving mere outlines and shadows. It would take until the 1980s for scientists to see the precise internal structure of viruses, with the &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/advanced-chemistryprize2017.pdf"&gt;invention of cryo-electron microscopy&lt;/a&gt;. Here, a thin film of the sample would be plunged into a very cold liquid so fast that water solidified without forming ice crystals. This glass-like water, called vitreous ice, locked molecules in place in their native structure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With time, scientists developed &lt;a href="https://communities.springernature.com/posts/smaller-than-the-space-between-atoms-the-technology-behind-the-highest-resolution-microscope-image"&gt;better detectors&lt;/a&gt; and computational methods to combine overlaps from thousands of images to reconstruct the 3D structure of microbes down to their individual &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-virology-101416-041921"&gt;atoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. In the last decade, visualizing the atomic structure of its proteins helped finally &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11898631/"&gt;develop safe and effective vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, decades after &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4305198/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4783420/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;efforts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4305199/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt;. The critical site was a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4459498"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; on its surface, the fusion protein, which helps the virus enter cells. The protein changes shape after it enters cells, by which point it’s too late: even if our immune system could recognize it, it wouldn’t matter. But its pre-fusion shape, &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; it enters, is a powerful target. After scientists could see its structure with crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, they used &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4461862/"&gt;genetic engineering&lt;/a&gt; to mutate the protein and lock it in its pre-fusion shape for a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rsv-microscopes-1024x625.png" alt="" class="wp-image-13099" srcset="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rsv-microscopes-1024x625.png 1024w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rsv-microscopes-300x183.png 300w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rsv-microscopes-768x468.png 768w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rsv-microscopes-1536x937.png 1536w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rsv-microscopes-2048x1249.png 2048w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rsv-microscopes-402x245.png 402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rsv-microscopes-462x282.png 462w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rsv-microscopes-662x404.png 662w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rsv-microscopes-722x440.png 722w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rsv-microscopes-982x599.png 982w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rsv-microscopes-1032x630.png 1032w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rsv-microscopes-1402x855.png 1402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rsv-microscopes-1702x1038.png 1702w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rsv-microscopes-2002x1221.png 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Precision vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The RSV vaccine was also part of a major shift in vaccine technology: it was not the whole virus but an individual protein. Until the mid-twentieth century, the vast majority of vaccines had been made from whole pathogens. Making precise vaccines, containing only a few key ingredients, would improve their safety and widen their breadth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This approach gradually replaced the Pasteurian method of culturing and weakening a microbe. The first step came in 1890, only a few years after Pasteur’s breakthrough, when the doctors &lt;a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/kjm1952/40/1/40_1_35/_pdf"&gt;Emil von Behring and Kitasato Shibasaburo&lt;/a&gt; discovered ‘&lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1901/behring/article/"&gt;serum therapy&lt;/a&gt;’. By passively transferring the serum of an infected person or animal to someone else, they could prevent or treat the latterʼs infection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their serum therapy tamed diphtheria, whose victims, &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4587476?seq=2"&gt;typically young children&lt;/a&gt;, could die of suffocation within days. The bacteria release a toxin that kills throat cells, causing our body to respond by laying a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/181/Supplement_1/S116/837949"&gt;tough, clot-like membrane&lt;/a&gt; that can inadvertently seal the airway and choke us. Unfortunately, serum therapy gave only &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/1181518"&gt;fleeting&lt;/a&gt; protection: whatever was in the serum didn’t teach the immune system to recognize and remember the pathogen later on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over three decades later, researchers &lt;a href="https://www.pasteur.fr/en/research-journal/news/diphtheria-hundred-years-ago-first-toxoid-vaccine"&gt;developed&lt;/a&gt; an active, longer-lasting vaccine against diphtheria by &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/261378"&gt;inactivating&lt;/a&gt; the bacteriaʼs toxins using &lt;a href="https://www.academie-sciences.fr/pdf/eloges/ramon_notice.pdf"&gt;formalin&lt;/a&gt;, while maintaining their ability to stimulate an immune response. Diphtheria cases fell dramatically. It was the first example of what we now call a ‘subunit vaccine’, containing only a particular part – in this case the inactivated toxin – of the bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though serum therapy was being replaced by vaccines, it had also given scientists a key insight: serum carried protective factors that could defend someone against pathogens they had encountered before. Those protective factors included &lt;a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/how-to-make-an-antibody/"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt;, which attach to particular parts of the pathogen, called ‘antigens’.&lt;/p&gt;






        

    



&lt;p&gt;Researchers developed a growing set of tools to detect and quantify antibodies. What they found was remarkable: antibodies weren’t just vaguely anti-foreign, they were highly specific. Tiny differences in the molecular structure of an antigen could lead to entirely different immune responses, as the doctor &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1930/landsteiner/biographical/"&gt;Karl Landsteiner&lt;/a&gt; discovered when he &lt;a href="https://digitalcommons.rockefeller.edu/ru-authors/132/"&gt;worked out&lt;/a&gt; the chemical basis of blood groups. But how could the body possibly &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4331447?seq=2"&gt;generate so much diversity and specificity&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One theory, the ‘instructional’ model, was &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja01867a018"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; by Linus Pauling. He suggested that the microbe acted as a template, molding the shape of the nascent antibody to fit it. This seemed to explain the high specificity of the interactions at first. But with more data, &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/48752648?seq=1"&gt;the model broke down&lt;/a&gt;. Just a single unit of an antigen could generate millions or even billions of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8966904/"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; that were exact copies of one another, not what you’d expect if they all required contact. And some were present even before exposure to an antigen, like the natural antibodies people have against other blood groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gradually, the field shifted toward another model, &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.41.11.849"&gt;proposed by Niels Jerne&lt;/a&gt;, which suggested that antigens weren’t reshaping antibodies: &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev.iy.04.040186.000245"&gt;they were being recognized by a pre-existing antibody repertoire&lt;/a&gt;. This was refined into ‘&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/clonalselectiont00burn/page/58/mode/2up"&gt;clonal selection theory&lt;/a&gt;’ by Macfarlane Burnet in 1957: each white blood cell expresses a unique antibody, and when it finds a matching antigen, clones of that white blood cell multiply and release thousands of antibodies per second. The massive diversity of white blood cells, researchers later found out, isn’t encoded from birth –  the DNA of developing white blood cells is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5089068/"&gt;actively cut, shuffled, and stitched back together&lt;/a&gt; during our lifetimes into &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7153836/"&gt;tens of millions&lt;/a&gt; of unique antibody-producing cells, generated continuously after birth, waiting for the right antigen to come along.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-1024x899.png" alt="" class="wp-image-13105" srcset="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-1024x899.png 1024w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-300x264.png 300w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-768x675.png 768w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-1536x1349.png 1536w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-2048x1799.png 2048w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-402x353.png 402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-462x406.png 462w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-662x582.png 662w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-722x634.png 722w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-982x863.png 982w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-1032x907.png 1032w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-1402x1232.png 1402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-1702x1495.png 1702w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-2002x1759.png 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This extreme specificity meant the immune system didn’t need the entire pathogen to trigger a response, but only a part of it, the right antigen, to recognize it in the future. It laid the groundwork for an entirely different approach to developing vaccines or improving existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One example was the vaccine against &lt;a href="https://vaccineknowledge.ox.ac.uk/pertussis-whooping-cough#Key-disease-facts"&gt;pertussis&lt;/a&gt;, or whooping cough, a disease that leaves infants and young children violently gasping for breath. Pertussis &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/hv.29576"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt; were developed back in 1914, and their rollout massively reduced the spread of the disease. But they also contained the whole bacterial cell and could cause rare side effects. The &lt;em&gt;Bordetella pertussis&lt;/em&gt; bacterium has &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK220494/"&gt;thousands of antigens&lt;/a&gt;, and injecting vaccines containing the whole bacterium meant injecting unnecessary material. Rising concern about the safety of the vaccine led to lawsuits in the United States and, in Japan, the government suspended it. As vaccination rates dropped, &lt;a href="https://idsc.niid.go.jp/iasr/18/207/tpc207.html"&gt;pertussis cases and deaths rose&lt;/a&gt;, spurring an international research effort to develop a better vaccine: one that contained only the antigens necessary for protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yuji and Hiroko Sato, a husband and wife team working at the National Institute of Health in Japan, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10600185/"&gt;found two such antigens&lt;/a&gt;: pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin. They purified and detoxified them with formalin. The resulting vaccine became part of the diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine, which was &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d42859-020-00013-8"&gt;introduced in Japan in 1981&lt;/a&gt; and later adopted globally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More and more vaccines have been developed with this approach, as scientists have sifted through pathogens to find only key antigens that are needed for a subunit vaccine. As they’ve replaced older vaccines, the&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK220494/"&gt; number of antigens&lt;/a&gt; that children receive in childhood vaccines has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7173515/"&gt;fallen sharply&lt;/a&gt;. Children receive more vaccines today, but fewer and more targeted antigens than they did back in 1900, when only the smallpox vaccine was widely available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccines-antigens-routine-schedule_v2-841x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-13107" srcset="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccines-antigens-routine-schedule_v2-841x1024.png 841w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccines-antigens-routine-schedule_v2-246x300.png 246w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccines-antigens-routine-schedule_v2-768x935.png 768w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccines-antigens-routine-schedule_v2-1261x1536.png 1261w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccines-antigens-routine-schedule_v2-1681x2048.png 1681w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccines-antigens-routine-schedule_v2-402x490.png 402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccines-antigens-routine-schedule_v2-462x563.png 462w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccines-antigens-routine-schedule_v2-662x806.png 662w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccines-antigens-routine-schedule_v2-722x879.png 722w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccines-antigens-routine-schedule_v2-982x1196.png 982w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccines-antigens-routine-schedule_v2-1032x1257.png 1032w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccines-antigens-routine-schedule_v2-1402x1708.png 1402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccines-antigens-routine-schedule_v2-1702x2073.png 1702w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccines-antigens-routine-schedule_v2-2002x2438.png 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 841px) 100vw, 841px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Subunit vaccines have many &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118870914"&gt;advantages&lt;/a&gt;. Without the entire pathogen, there are fewer contaminants, fewer unnecessary antigens, and fewer side effects. They can also easily contain antigens from multiple pathogens, protecting people from all of them at once. But stripping vaccines down to a few components can also come at a cost: the acellular pertussis vaccine, for example, was safer but also less effective, with immune protection &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5710106/"&gt;waning&lt;/a&gt; after a few years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the twentieth century, immunologists discovered new ways to restore the potency that subunit vaccines had lost. They found ‘&lt;a href="https://press.asimov.com/articles/adjuvants"&gt;adjuvants&lt;/a&gt;’, such as aluminium salts and oil-based emulsions, that could dramatically strengthen the immune response. They also learned that the way a vaccine’s antigens are presented, the structure, formulation, and delivery, could shape immunity. Step by step, scientists learned to recreate the strength of whole-pathogen vaccines with the safety of their purified descendants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The genomic revolution&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new era began when scientists stopped merely cultivating viruses and began decoding them. Over the last 50 years, genome sequencing has grown faster and cheaper, and genetic engineering has become ever more precise: the blueprints of pathogens have become both readable and editable, making it possible to rapidly redesign vaccines to match an evolving world of microbes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, it took &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-genom-111919-082433"&gt;weeks or months&lt;/a&gt; to laboriously decode the sequence of a single gene. Even in the 1980s, after automated sequencers were introduced, it took days per gene. But by the 2010s, &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-genom-111919-082433"&gt;propelled by the Human Genome Project&lt;/a&gt;, scientists could read entire genomes in the same amount of time with new sequencers, at a tiny fraction of the cost. Since then, some sequencing devices have been made so compact they can be &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21495-usb-stick-can-sequence-dna-in-seconds/"&gt;plugged into a computer like a USB stick&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-842x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-13190" srcset="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-842x1024.png 842w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-247x300.png 247w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-768x935.png 768w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-1262x1536.png 1262w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-1683x2048.png 1683w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-402x489.png 402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-462x562.png 462w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-662x806.png 662w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-722x879.png 722w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-982x1195.png 982w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-1032x1256.png 1032w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-1402x1706.png 1402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-1702x2071.png 1702w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-2002x2436.png 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 842px) 100vw, 842px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists can now compare thousands of strains to one another and analyze how changes in a virus’s genetic code weaken it. They found, for example, that only &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC521805/"&gt;a handful of mutations&lt;/a&gt; were needed to attenuate the poliovirus into a vaccine that doesn’t invade nerve cells or cause paralysis. By experimenting and tweaking it further, scientists developed a &lt;a href="https://europepmc.org/article/pmc/pmc7566161"&gt;new, more stable oral polio vaccine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sequencing can also help identify better genes to use as vaccine targets. Genes that are conserved across multiple strains of a virus can help make a vaccine that protects against them all; genes encoding proteins on a virus’s surface make for better immune recognition. This approach of finding antigens through genetics, known as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3633180/"&gt;reverse vaccinology&lt;/a&gt;, produced the first effective meningitis B vaccine in 2013. Finally, sequencing has enabled scientists to track evolving viruses like influenza and Covid-19 in real time in order to update their vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside these advances, scientists learned to transfer and edit genes between organisms, turning &lt;a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/animals-as-chemical-factories/"&gt;cells into tools of manufacture&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1970s, biologists Paul Berg, Stanley Cohen, and Herbert Boyer developed methods to &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.69.10.2904"&gt;combine DNA&lt;/a&gt; from different organisms. This method, called &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Recombinant-DNA-Technology"&gt;recombinant DNA technology&lt;/a&gt;, involved cutting DNA with restriction enzymes and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC427208/"&gt;pasting it into vectors&lt;/a&gt;, transforming bacteria, yeast, or insect cells into miniature factories that can produce proteins like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC382885/"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt; in bulk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This solved another problem that subunit vaccines had. In the past, developing them required purifying proteins from viruses grown in eggs or tissues, which was laborious, gave low yields and could contain contaminants. Recombinant DNA technology replaced this process. It helped Maurice Hilleman, who made &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vaccinated-Defeat-Worlds-Deadliest-Diseases/dp/006122796X"&gt;over 40 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; in his lifetime, develop the first recombinant &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-1339-5_25"&gt;hepatitis B vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. It contained only one key surface protein from the virus and was far easier to manufacture than previous versions of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also helped develop the first human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, which contains copies of a protein from the outer shell of the virus. When expressed in yeast or insect cells, these proteins &lt;a href="https://laskerfoundation.org/winners/hpv-vaccines-for-cancer-prevention/"&gt;spontaneously assemble&lt;/a&gt; into hollow ‘virus-like particles’ that resemble the real virus but contain nothing inside. The immune system responds as though they are genuine viral invaders, giving it the ability to respond swiftly if it encounters the real virus later on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recombinant DNA technology can also combine targets from multiple microbes. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa621"&gt;HPV vaccine Gardasil-9&lt;/a&gt;, for example, protects against nine virus strains by including a key antigen from the surface of each one. In doing so, it &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hpv-vaccination-world-can-eliminate-cervical-cancer"&gt;protects people&lt;/a&gt; from a wide range of HPV infections that can cause cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, penis, anus, head and neck.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-1024x992.png" alt="" class="wp-image-13115" srcset="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-1024x992.png 1024w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-300x291.png 300w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-768x744.png 768w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-1536x1488.png 1536w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-2048x1984.png 2048w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-402x389.png 402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-462x448.png 462w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-662x641.png 662w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-722x699.png 722w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-982x951.png 982w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-1032x1000.png 1032w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-1402x1358.png 1402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-1702x1649.png 1702w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-2002x1940.png 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not all proteins self-assemble and many arenʼt easy to manufacture this way. Viruses typically use our own cells’ machinery to make their proteins, which assemble in specific ways for the virus to multiply. But viral proteins can end up processed &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06121-4"&gt;incorrectly&lt;/a&gt; when grown in recombinant bacteria or yeast, since they have different machinery. To make recombinant vaccine proteins, scientists often spend years experimenting and optimizing the protein’s shape and structure to develop a vaccine, with each protein requiring its own long optimization process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A better idea is to bypass microbial factories entirely and make cells in our own&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;body produce the proteins for a vaccine. In the 1990s, scientists tried making &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1545867/"&gt;DNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for this purpose, with circular plasmid DNA to deliver the instructions into muscle so it could make vaccine proteins. The idea was promising in animals but inefficient in humans: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4955855"&gt;DNA struggles to enter cells&lt;/a&gt; and an even smaller fraction would reach the nucleus for this idea to work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4624045/"&gt;more direct route&lt;/a&gt; is to use mRNA, which can be translated straight away by our protein-making machinery outside the cellʼs nucleus. mRNA is also transient, producing a protein we can recognize before disappearing itself. But it also triggers strong immune reactions, is chemically fragile before it enters cells, easily destroyed by enzymes. Step by step, these obstacles were overcome: first, in 2005, when the scientists &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2023/press-release/"&gt;Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman&lt;/a&gt; developed a method to tweak it and make it less visible to the immune system, and then in 2014, when Weissman and other researchers developed &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525001617301119"&gt;‘lipid nanoparticle’ systems&lt;/a&gt; to carry, protect, and deliver the mRNA safely into cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result was a rapid, adaptable platform that could be redesigned almost as quickly as new threats emerged: because it &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-021-00283-5#Sec1"&gt;bypasses microbial factories&lt;/a&gt; entirely, each new vaccine can be formulated and updated &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2622-0"&gt;within weeks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 230 years since Jenner’s discovery, vaccine technology has changed inconceivably, and many diseases that plagued humanity are mostly forgotten. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It has become far easier and faster to develop new vaccines. Microbes that were once invisible to us can now be observed at an atomic level. Vaccines were once cultured in animals, then tissues, then cells, and now their individual proteins can be built in microbial factories. They can be engineered to be safer and more precise than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biology has had golden ages in the past, as scientists rapidly discovered new microbes, antibiotics, and drugs: microbiology’s &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/erasinepidemiolo0000suss"&gt;golden age&lt;/a&gt; developed in the late nineteenth century, while &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/golden-age-antibiotics"&gt;antibiotic development&lt;/a&gt; had a golden age in the mid-twentieth century. Meanwhile, vaccine development has actually sped up; in the last five years alone, scientists have developed the first effective vaccines against four additional diseases. If we invest in them, the future holds many more. The golden age of vaccine development lies ahead of us.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A new year might mean new viral threats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old viruses are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/bird-flu-could-be-on-the-cusp-of-transmitting-between-humans-but-there-are-ways-to-slow-down-viral-evolution-250232"&gt;constantly evolving&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/58-of-human-infectious-diseases-can-be-worsened-by-climate-change-we-scoured-77-000-studies-to-map-the-pathways-188256"&gt;warming and increasingly populated planet&lt;/a&gt; puts humans in contact with more and different viruses. And increased mobility means that viruses can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20201479"&gt;rapidly travel across the globe&lt;/a&gt; along with their human hosts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an &lt;a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7003-018X"&gt;infectious diseases physician and researcher&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll be keeping an eye on a few viruses in 2026 that could be poised to cause infections in unexpected places or in unexpected numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Influenza A – on the cusp of a pandemic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Influenza A is a perennial threat. The virus infects a wide range of animals and has the ability to mutate rapidly. The most recent influenza pandemic – caused by the H1N1 subtype of influenza in 2009 – killed &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(12)70121-4"&gt;over 280,000 people worldwide in its first year&lt;/a&gt;, and the virus continues to circulate today. This virus was often called &lt;a href="https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/h1n1-flu-pandemic-2009"&gt;swine flu&lt;/a&gt; because it originated in pigs in Mexico before circulating around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently, scientists have been monitoring the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2025.06.007"&gt;highly-pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 subtype&lt;/a&gt;, or bird flu. This virus was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02209-24"&gt;first found in humans in southern China&lt;/a&gt; in 1997; wild birds helped spread the virus around the world. In 2024, the virus was found for the first time in &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/avian-flu-has-infected-dairy-cows-in-more-than-a-dozen-states-a-microbiologist-explains-how-the-virus-is-spreading-235526"&gt;dairy cattle in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently became &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07849-4"&gt;established in herds in several states&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/709001/original/file-20251216-56-rk9diu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Avian flu has spread across dairy herds in the U.S.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/BirdFluLab/9546df6d5c9749298983811f43bba3a3/photo"&gt;USDA Agricultural Research Service via AP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/humans-infecting-animals-infecting-humans-from-covid-19-to-bird-flu-preventing-pandemics-requires-protecting-all-species-212679"&gt;crossover of the virus&lt;/a&gt; from birds to mammals created major concern that it could become adapted to humans. Studies suggest there have already been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7344a3"&gt;many cow-to-human transmissions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2026, scientists will continue to look for any evidence that H5N1 has changed enough to be &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/bird-flu-could-be-on-the-cusp-of-transmitting-between-humans-but-there-are-ways-to-slow-down-viral-evolution-250232"&gt;transmitted from human to human&lt;/a&gt; – a necessary step for the start of a new influenza pandemic. The influenza vaccines currently on the market probably don’t offer protection from H5N1, but scientists are &lt;a href="https://asm.org/articles/2025/march/avian-influenza-h5n1-vaccines-what-status"&gt;working to create vaccines&lt;/a&gt; that would be effective against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mpox – worldwide and liable to worsen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mpox virus, formerly called monkeypox virus, was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.277.5324.312"&gt;first discovered in the 1950s&lt;/a&gt;. For many decades, it was seen rarely, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. Contrary to its original name, the virus mostly infects rodents and occasionally &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.spid.2004.09.001"&gt;crossed over into humans&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mpox is closely related to smallpox, and infection results in a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-mpox-a-microbiologist-explains-whats-known-about-this-smallpox-cousin-236857"&gt;fever and painful rash&lt;/a&gt; that can last for weeks. There are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-025-10896-5"&gt;several varieties of mpox&lt;/a&gt;, including a generally more severe clade I and a milder clade II. A vaccine for mpox is available, but there are no effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Mpox has spread around the world.&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-023-01675-2"&gt;global outbreak of clade II mpox&lt;/a&gt; spread to more than 100 countries that had never seen the virus before. This outbreak was driven by human-to-human transmission of the virus through close contact, often via sex. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the number of mpox cases has significantly declined since the 2022 outbreak, &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/mpox-worldwide-overview"&gt;clade II mpox has become established&lt;/a&gt; around the world.  Several countries in central Africa have also reported an &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON587"&gt;increase in clade I mpox cases&lt;/a&gt; since 2024. Since August 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/10/17/california-mpox-strain-cases/86748970007/"&gt;four clade I mpox cases have occurred in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, including in people who did not travel to Africa. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unclear how mpox outbreaks in the U.S. and abroad will continue to evolve in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Oropouche virus – insect-borne and poised to spread&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oropouche virus was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.1961.10.574"&gt;first identified in the 1950s&lt;/a&gt; on the island of Trinidad off the coast of South America. The virus is carried by mosquitoes and small &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.32473/EDIS-IN626-2025"&gt;biting midges, also known as no-see-ums&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people with the virus experience &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/oropouche-virus-disease"&gt;fever, headache and muscle aches&lt;/a&gt;. The illness usually lasts just a few days, but some patients have weakness that can persist for weeks. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41541-022-00456-2"&gt;illness can also recur&lt;/a&gt; after someone has initially recovered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/708999/original/file-20251216-56-y06wxk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Biting midges – which carry Oropouche virus – are hard to see, as their alias ‘no-seem-ums’ implies.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CSIRO_ScienceImage_11052_Biting_midge_on_human_skin.jpg"&gt;CSIRO via Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many unanswered questions about the Oropouche virus and the disease it causes, and there are no specific treatments or vaccines. For decades, infections in people were thought to occur only in the Amazon region. However, beginning in the early 2000s, cases began to show up in a larger area of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11908-025-00862-2"&gt;South America, Central America and the Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;. Cases in the United States are usually among travelers returning from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2026, Oropouche outbreaks will likely continue to affect travelers in the Americas. The biting midge that carries Oropouche virus is found throughout North and South America, including the southeastern United States. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41541-022-00456-2"&gt;range of the virus&lt;/a&gt; could continue to expand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Even more viral threats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of other viruses pose a risk in 2026. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya"&gt;global outbreaks of chikungunya virus&lt;/a&gt; may affect travelers, some of whom may want to consider getting vaccinated for this disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/canada-loses-its-official-measles-free-status-and-the-us-will-follow-soon-as-vaccination-rates-fall-269090"&gt;Measles cases continue to rise&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. and globally against the backdrop of &lt;a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2025/06/03/united-states-measles-vaccination-rate-declines/"&gt;decreasing vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/hiv-knows-no-borders-and-the-trump-administrations-new-strategy-leave-americans-vulnerable-an-hiv-prevention-expert-explains-264871"&gt;HIV is poised for a resurgence&lt;/a&gt;, despite the availability of effective treatments, due to &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/cutting-hiv-aid-means-undercutting-us-foreign-and-economic-interests-nigeria-shows-the-human-costs-253705"&gt;disruptions in international aid&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Despite the availability of effective treatments, diseases like HIV and measles are seeing resurgences.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/KenyaHIVCareatRisk/9c0d755d2ff04779980860f0e2183f97/photo"&gt;Brian Inganga/AP Photo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as-yet-undiscovered viruses can always emerge in the future as &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/future-pandemics-will-have-the-same-human-causes-as-ancient-outbreaks-lessons-from-anthropology-can-help-prevent-them-224622"&gt;humans disrupt ecosystems and travel&lt;/a&gt; around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the world, people, animals and the wider environment are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/humans-infecting-animals-infecting-humans-from-covid-19-to-bird-flu-preventing-pandemics-requires-protecting-all-species-212679"&gt;dependent on each other&lt;/a&gt;. Vigilance for known and emerging viral threats and the development of new vaccines and treatments can help keep everyone safe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

The cat went in for testing on Jan. 2 and was confirmed to have it on Jan. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terri McCollister, the rabies program manager with DPH, recommends people keep their distance from stray and feral cats since they can carry diseases like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/henderson-county-officials-bat-encounters-urge-safety-measures-hendersonville-department-public-health-summer-camps-wildlife-commission-tested-rabies-avoid-contact" target="_blank"&gt;HENDERSON COUNTY OFFICIALS WARN OF RISING INDOOR BAT ENCOUNTERS, URGE SAFETY MEASURES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you see an animal in need, watch it from a distance and contact someone trained in handling animals, such as your local animal control officer, wildlife control operator, or wildlife rehabilitator," McCollister said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or someone you know came into contact with this cat, the DPH asks you to call the Greenwood office at 864-942-3600.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case involving the cat follows another &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/rabid-cow-confirmed-anderson-county-19-livestock-exposed" target="_blank"&gt;case announced on Jan. 5&lt;/a&gt;, where a beef cow in Anderson County tested positive for rabies and exposed 19 other cows to the deadly virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cow was found near Gentry Road and Highway 81 in Starr, South Carolina, and went in for testing on Dec. 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/south-carolina-measles-outbreak-surpasses-200-cases-department-public-health-update-quarantine-schools-exposure-locations" target="_blank"&gt;SOUTH CAROLINA MEASLES OUTBREAK SURPASSES 200 CASES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No people are known to have been exposed in this case. However, anyone who believes they, their family members, or their pets came into contact with this cow or another animal that may have rabies, should call DPH's Anderson office at 864-372-3270.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cow was the first animal in the state to&lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/animal-borne-diseases/rabies" target="_blank"&gt; test positive for rabies in 2026&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DPH says it's important to keep pets and livestock up to date on their rabies vaccinations as it's the easiest and most effective way to protect against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on rabies in South Carolina, click &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/animal-borne-diseases/rabies" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WLOS</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 13:11:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxNVTl5eWk3T3J2NjU0X05RQ1RNakE0eHZKdG1zcWJXYld0LUM3NjBrNjN3R0k5RHZDSkZCTjRUc3VjVFFEd2g0RXlHV3VmN281UnZNcnQxVVUyWG5MYnJ3aldQS1pMYUxDbV9ndXlLNkt2R0VEVGh5S0xQUkxndlctTTJxTF9tNGctXzdCNER2cS0xX2JmOUtydGNDQWpqSm5sZDNGcHkzS1VCZTlFSVRUeEtTM0g3aHNzX3VPR29iLWl5UGxDRmxMZm5xNElpSXAyNWMtMi1oZXBVUE4yakZvaEV3</guid></item><item><title>当丢失的狗上车时，黄金猎犬提供最阴暗的眼球-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/golden-retriever-gives-shadiest-eye-131000363.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;My dogs both have a jealous streak.

The gorgeous Golden actually rolled his eyes to emphasize his displeasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The look on his face spoke volumes.

But it’s still the same thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Just Treatment worked with campaign group &lt;a href="https://twn.my/twnintro.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Third World Network&lt;/a&gt; to approach Beximco three years ago about creating a generic ETI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“[There have been] a number of calls where I’ve come off it in tears thinking, ‘this is actually going to happen’ and what that would mean to the community,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Almost 80,000 people are thought to be living with undiagnosed cystic fibrosis, and 82% of those are in low- and middle-income countries. Pledger hopes that an affordable treatment will help find them. “When there’s nothing available, what is the point in diagnosing them?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As individuals, Pledger says, it is easy to feel powerless. But when families come together “it’s an incredible power, especially mums. It’s our drive to look after our children […] you give them the right tools, the legal tools, to fight – and we’ve seen again and again, it’s just the most incredible force.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Now the fight is to get the drug to patients – either by self-funding through the buyers’ club or by lobbying governments to take up the affordable option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Bangladesh, as a “least developed country”, is excluded from some international intellectual property laws, paving the way for Beximco to produce and export a generic version.

She explained that green bell peppers are high in chlorophyll, a pigment that gives them their green color. “As the peppers mature on the vine, the chlorophyll breaks down, and more carotenoids [a type of antioxidant] are produced, accounting for the change in color and nutrient profile,” she said. Hultin added that, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/banana-ripeness-and-health-g_l_6931b101e4b08d8fed00c74f" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="unlike bananas," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6941aaf3e4b06cf6877f4c25" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="6931b101e4b08d8fed00c74f" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;unlike bananas,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; bell peppers are non-climacteric fruits and don’t ripen after they’ve been picked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8434037/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a 2021 review published in the journal " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6941aaf3e4b06cf6877f4c25" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8434037/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;a 2021 review published in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Molecules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; explains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, all bell peppers contain carbohydrates, fiber, antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin A, potassium, calcium and phosphorus.

All three dietitians emphasized that the nutritional differences between different colored bell peppers aren’t huge, so you shouldn’t get too hung up on it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Each bell pepper offers a unique antioxidant profile, so it’s best to ‘eat the colors of the rainbow’ when it comes to bell peppers so that you can reap the nutritional benefits of each kind,” Lydon said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, yellow bell peppers are particularly high in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6827103/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="lutein and zeaxanthin" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6941aaf3e4b06cf6877f4c25" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6827103/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;&lt;span&gt;lutein and zeaxanthin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, two nutrients that support eye health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As for green bell peppers, Hultin said they are lower in calories. “Green bell peppers have slightly fewer calories than their red, orange and yellow counterparts since they are less ripe and their natural sugars haven’t accumulated yet. However, this difference is negligible,” she said. A red bell pepper contains about &lt;a href="https://www.eatthismuch.com/calories/red-bell-pepper-2440" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="37 calories" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6941aaf3e4b06cf6877f4c25" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.eatthismuch.com/calories/red-bell-pepper-2440" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;37 calories&lt;/a&gt; per pepper, while a &lt;a href="https://nutriscan.app/calories-nutrition/green-bell-pepper" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="green pepper contains 24" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6941aaf3e4b06cf6877f4c25" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://nutriscan.app/calories-nutrition/green-bell-pepper" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="15"&gt;green pepper contains 24&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It bears repeating that when it comes to the nutritional differences among bell pepper colors, all three dietitians say these differences are pretty minimal across the board, so it’s important not to get too hung up on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How you cook them matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to get the maximum benefits from your peppers, how you cook them matters. “Steaming and stir-frying are two good ways to cook bell peppers to help prevent the loss of water-soluble vitamins like vitamin C,” Michalczyk said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recommends avoiding boiling or cooking bell peppers at high heat to preserve their nutrient density as much as possible. “It’s good to keep in mind that overcooking can degrade nutrients found in vegetables and boiling can cause the water-soluble vitamins to leach into the water,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since vitamin A is fat-soluble, Hutlin recommends sautéing peppers in extra-virgin olive oil to help maximize nutrient absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is no shortage of bell pepper recipes you can find online to experiment with to learn your favorite ways to eat bell peppers. Lydon said that, personally, she loves stuffed bell peppers because they’re easily customizable based on taste preferences and the ingredients you have on hand. “Make it a well-balanced, satisfying meal by adding a source of lean protein like ground turkey, chicken or fish, a starch high in fiber like brown rice or quinoa and a dietary fat like cheese or avocado,” she shared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hultin says that bell peppers can be easily mixed into soups, stews, omelettes or frittatas for breakfast, roasted as a side or enjoyed raw and sliced to pair with hummus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, all colors of bell peppers make a great addition to the diet, so I wouldn’t stress too much about getting one color vs. the other,” Michalczyk emphasized. “Go for a variety to reap the benefits from the health compounds that are unique to each color. In the winter, during cold and flu season, I think it’s great to know that red bell pepper has more vitamin C than an orange and incorporate those into different meals and snacks to support your immune system.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s also important to remember that bell peppers are just one of many nutrient-rich foods, including ones &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-to-eat-to-boost-your-immune-system-this-fall-goog_l_651446c7e4b080568d95dac8" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="that support your immune system.

Typically, what we see is the flu season really start to go up in early January, if we’re lucky. It peaks during the first or second, sometimes the third week in January, and then begins to go down. It’s not clear it’s going straight up right now.

The strain accounts for the prevalent flu strain this season. Health experts are particularly tracking the H3N2 subclade K variant, which is being reported in 90% of cases. The strain is a different variant from the strain in this year’s flu shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-27" data-gaid="inarticle-27"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KSAFDTFJJVCVFCHYLH7LSKQUHY"&gt;The so-called subclade K led to early outbreaks in the United Kingdom, Japan and Canada this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-28" data-gaid="inarticle-28"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FNPZEAXYH5EWHOGSAWQDV462LU"&gt;“There’s no evidence that this new subclade causes more severe disease or results in hospitalizations or death with more frequency,” Goldman said. “However, when you have more flu, you have more people who end up being hospitalized or end up dying simply because if you have a greater number, even if the percentage who end up with severe disease remains the same, if you have more cases, you have more severe disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-29" data-gaid="inarticle-29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LEHT535HAVBPLNSWI2MH5Q3MIU"&gt;Because the subclade K is getting around pre-existing immunity from the vaccine or other infections, more people are getting the flu, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-30" data-gaid="inarticle-30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PGDJYC6RBFABBIJJBLBMEVQHDI"&gt;Approximately 90% of flu-related deaths and flu-related hospitalizations are seen in people 65 and older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-31" data-gaid="inarticle-31"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4VWW6GZ3HNHXXO524RTGWL2TXQ"&gt;While the &lt;a href="https://www.pennlive.com/topic/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.pennlive.com/topic/donald-trump/"&gt;Trump administration &lt;/a&gt;no longer recommends flu shots or &lt;a href="https://www.pennlive.com/health/2026/01/us-cuts-recommended-childhood-vaccines-what-parents-need-to-know.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.pennlive.com/health/2026/01/us-cuts-recommended-childhood-vaccines-what-parents-need-to-know.html"&gt;other types of vaccines for all children, &lt;/a&gt;many health experts are standing by the long-held protocol in this country in favor of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-32" data-gaid="inarticle-32"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MA7WWQYAC5GTLLMJK7ICAX24X4"&gt;“It’s not too late to get the flu vaccine,” Goldman said. “We would recommend the flu shot for everyone. We strongly recommend it for people above the age of 65 and those with pre-existing conditions. And given that the flu season this year is more severe, we’re strongly recommending that if you have not gotten the flu shot yet, you should get it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-33" data-gaid="inarticle-33"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KDRDAQAAUBFPXOKQ47FUNLTYY4"&gt;Early data show this year’s flu vaccine is effective at reducing influenza-related emergency department visits and hospital admissions, officials from the state Department of Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-34" data-gaid="inarticle-34"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5NVCT2JHUJFP5ATDYFOY5ZBPU4"&gt;“Public health experts consistently state that the vaccine still provides strong protection against severe illness,” department officials said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-35" data-gaid="inarticle-35"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KYSEEMZJAVDXTAHC7R5ELNC43Q"&gt;How can you tell if what you have is the flu or Covid? There really is only one sure way to determine. That’s because both the flu and Covid can induce coughs, shortness of breath, fatigue, runny noses, head and body pains, sore throats and gastrointestinal issues, according to the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-36" data-gaid="inarticle-36"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:APR7KJCPQNHC5HHGKSVSLBQKUU" data-fusion-component="APR7KJCPQNHC5HHGKSVSLBQKUU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rawhtml"&gt;

Covid often comes on gradually; while with the flu, people frequently describe feeling like they’ve suddenly been “hit by a dump truck,” Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, told The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-38" data-gaid="inarticle-38"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="P2DDKRSAFBCCZKWZMRSSZTSMYA"&gt;The only sure way to discern one from the other is to test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-39" data-gaid="inarticle-39"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6CI3YWM7RFH2VKIXZ2Y3AKLWCI"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advice from the doctor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-40" data-gaid="inarticle-40"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VSPG4QZBXNHNBD6LF36OBZHNN4"&gt;If you are feeling under the weather, stay home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-41" data-gaid="inarticle-41"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RICRHEEF4NFGXAAX24MBJK52JA"&gt;“We all know people who are sneezing, coughing. They look like they have the flu. Stay away from those people,” Goldman said. “Don’t invite them to dinner. If you yourself are sick, then we do recommend that you stay home from work, you stay home from school, and, you know, if you have elderly parents, for example, you don’t go visit them. If you’re young and healthy, getting the flu may not be a big deal for you. On the other hand, if you give it to your elderly parents or elderly grandparents, it may be a big deal for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-42" data-gaid="inarticle-42"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3NSIVDDSFJELBF4EJ6OTWOHUGE"&gt;Is going to the ER the right decision?

A recent graduate of Kennesaw State University, Reece, then 22, had moved back home to Canton, Ga., in December 2024, and was juggling part-time work, social obligations and the stress of transitioning into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Part of living at home meant sleeping in her childhood twin-size bed, and the mild ache in her collarbone and shoulder seemed easily explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It was the kind of annoying pain you get when you sleep wrong,” Allie tells PEOPLE exclusively. “It wasn’t sharp or constant, and it usually went away by the next day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Over the next several months, the shoulder pain came and went — sometimes after golfing, other times after long walks — but it never lingered long enough to raise concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allie Reece&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allie Reece in April 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then, in April 2025, her worry spiked. Two weeks after a day on the golf course, she woke with a sharp, stabbing pain in her shoulder blade, unlike anything she had felt before. Alarmed, she went to the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Initially, doctors suspected a blood clot. But a CT scan revealed something far more serious: a mass in her chest, roughly the size of an orange. Physicians suspected lymphoma, though confirmation would take time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I'll never forget that first moment — it was disbelief,” Reece says. “You hear the word ‘mass,’ and your mind immediately goes to the worst-case scenario. Even knowing it could be treatable, the fear is overwhelming.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allie Reece&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allie Reece in the hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The following day, Reece met with an oncologist, a meeting she recalls as emotionally overwhelming. “I was a wreck,” she says. “Anytime someone would talk to me, I would just start crying. I’m not normally a crier, but for about two weeks, I was completely unstable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Her oncologist explained that the first step would be a fine needle biopsy, which extracts a small sample from the mass for testing. When the results came back benign, Reece’s anxiety only deepened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I ended up having three surgeries because everything kept coming back benign,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Determined to find answers, Reece sought a specialist at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta. She underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy — a delicate surgery around her heart and lungs — to biopsy three lymph nodes. Yet once again, the results came back benign, prolonging the uncertainty and fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It wasn’t until a PET scan was finally approved that clarity arrived. The images revealed both the mass and an affected lymph node, confirming the presence of cancer cells. Relief mingled with dread — at least now they knew the problem, but the road ahead remained daunting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The next step was a robotic thymectomy,” Reece recalls. “They went in through small incisions under my armpits and along my chest. They deflated my lung to reach the mass, which was wrapped around my heart and lungs. The plan was just a biopsy, but they were able to remove the entire mass.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allie Reece&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allie Reece during chemotherapy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After a week and a half of agonizing waiting, in August 2025, her oncologist delivered the long-awaited confirmation: &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hodgkins-lymphoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352646" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hodgkin’s lymphoma.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Hodgkin’s lymphoma.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They were very reassuring about the survival rate,” she says. “It’s very common in people our age. She told me, ‘You’re going to be fine. It’s going to be tough for a while, but you should live.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even with that reassurance, fear lingered. “Until you hear the final pathology results, it’s terrifying,” she says. “You feel like you’re walking on a tightrope every day.” But having a clear path to treatment offered a fragile sense of hope after months of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Right away, Reece, now 23, began an eight-round regimen called ABVD, a standard treatment for Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The side effects were immediate: fatigue, nausea and hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Determined to normalize the experience for others, Reece turned to &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@big_.al" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TikTok;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, sharing candid moments from chemotherapy appointments and the emotional journey of &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@big_.al/video/7580969266447387959" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:shaving her head;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;shaving her head&lt;/a&gt; — a story that reached over five million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I’m 23, dating and suddenly I had to face the fact that I was going to be bald. I wasn’t happy about it at all,” she says. To prepare, she experimented with wigs, ordering several and posting about them online to help other girls facing the same challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When the time came, she cut her long hair into a lob, thinking shorter hair would be easier to lose — a decision she calls one of her best ideas. As her hair thinned, she collected it in a bag she named Lola, a ritual that gave her a sense of control over something that felt completely uncontrollable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I wanted to show that it’s scary, but it’s doable,” she says. “You don’t have to be crying or miserable. If I can do it, anyone can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Reece also chose to freeze her eggs through IVF, a process she found intimidating because there weren’t many relatable resources online. “I wanted to make content that could help other girls going through the same thing — it’s scary, but doable. If I can do it, anyone can,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Her openness resonated. Messages poured in from people expressing gratitude, sharing their own experiences, or simply saying, “Thank you for sharing — it helps me feel less alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allie Reece&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allie Reece in the hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Throughout her treatment, she says her family and friends became her backbone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Her mother accompanied her to appointments, managing logistics and providing emotional support. Her brother shaved his head alongside her, while friends organized care packages, drove her to sessions and offered constant encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I couldn’t have done it without them,” Reece says. “They reminded me every day that I wasn’t in it alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, not every day was brave. Reece says some nights, after chemotherapy, she'd lay awake scared and exhausted, overwhelmed by uncertainty. Yet amid the fear, she found moments of resilience and gratitude, especially through her community of over 100,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There were days I thought, ‘I can’t do this,’ and other days I’d think, ‘I’ve got this,’” she says. “Cancer forces you to slow down and reflect on what matters most.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allie Reece&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allie Reece with her family&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After completing chemotherapy in December 2025, Reece marked the milestone by ringing the bell at the infusion center — a symbolic end to treatment. Surrounded by family, doctors and nurses, she reflected on the journey: the fear, the pain, the uncertainty and the unexpected joy of perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“That moment was surreal,” she says. “It was a mix of happiness, relief and gratitude. You don’t get to that point without the people around you, cheering you on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now cancer-free, Reece focuses on wellness, fitness and sharing her story to inspire others. She continues to post updates on social media, offering a glimpse into life after chemotherapy — including challenges, triumphs and the small, everyday moments that feel monumental after what she’s endured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If my story can make someone feel seen, heard or understood, then it’s worth sharing,” she says. “Cancer changes you, but it doesn’t define you. It’s about what you do after, how you live and who you lift up along the way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Even when symptoms seem minor, don’t ignore them,” she says. “It’s better to check and be safe. Early detection can make all the difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/23-year-old-diagnosed-with-cancer-after-annoying-shoulder-pain-exclusive-11878456" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News Canada</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPc0QzVHFha0RpYjhDaHNXTi1GS19zRGpVWVBLeF9HeEJ3LXozYVFjS3VzdG03bjg3RFZlNUdrbTIzdlNwRl93RlRYTmZtR2wyeTYxMk40SUxSWFNHV3hfWlVDNHI4bHVkbTFfZjBaMFQ1enotbmtSTUl1VkFGc0R0TW5vbUp6Vmhl</guid></item><item><title>25个人正在分享关于人体的最令人毛骨悚然的事实，我很后悔阅读每一个事实- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/arsheenkaur44/creepy-human-body-facts</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz__description

  &lt;p&gt;"2. Humans typically have one spleen located in the upper left abdomen, but it’s relatively common (around 10–20% of people) to have extra, smaller spleens, known as accessory spleens or splenunculi. These occur due to developmental variations or the body’s ability to regenerate spleen tissue after injury, a process called splenosis. There are cases of people having six. Unless surgery happens near them, they rarely cause issues, and most people never know they’re there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.

And that’s because Jake has a very different itinerary in mind. This very chill &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; from @jakethetxgolden basically treats every visitor like a temporary staff member for his personal Scritch Department. A popular video shows exactly what happens when you make the mistake of sitting on the couch while Jake is in the room: you effectively lose your hand rights for the foreseeable future. He doesn’t just ask for attention; he demands it with the kind of confidence only a “Texas Golden” could pull off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retriever sits in front of guests for them to pet him in video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The video starts with a man trying to carry on a normal conversation at a house party. But he has a big, blonde obstacle parked right in front of him on the floor. Jake is sitting there for a specific service. Every single time the man’s hand stops moving, the Golden Retriever performs this funny head backflip. It is essentially a manual override for human arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As soon as the person tries to focus back on the actual conversation, Jake’s head tilts all the way back until he is looking at them from a goofy, upside-down angle. The on-screen text basically lays down the law: if Jake chooses you, you are stuck petting him until he says otherwise. “Ahem, did I say stop?” is clearly the only thing going through his mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This Golden Retriever breed is famous for having absolutely no concept of personal space, and Jake is the poster boy for that. He manages to pull off that same head flip three times in a row, which eventually has everyone in stitches. To make things even better, the clip is set to Lenny Kravitz’s “It Ain’t Over ‘Til It’s Over,” which is just chef’s kiss levels of perfect for a dog who refuses to let the scritches end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One commenter even joked that the poor guest had accidentally signed up for a “petting sweatshop,” while another called it a “petting tax” instead of a cheese tax. You can tell Jake isn’t going to let anyone off the hook as long as there is a spare hand in the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a

consequences".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But James's MP, Chris Evans, will lead a Commons debate on the topic on Wednesday, as she hopes the changes could be implemented across

Three deaths from the flu have been reported since Christmas Eve. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BOISE, Idaho — As the nation experiences its worst flu season in three decades, Idaho stands out among the hardest-hit states, with Ada County hospitals treating more than four times as many flu patients as last year and at least three deaths reported since Christmas Eve.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're definitely concerned," Dr. Jaime Butler-Dawson, epidemiologist for &lt;a href="https://cdh.idaho.gov/"&gt;Central District Health&lt;/a&gt;, told KTVB Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports&lt;/a&gt; nearly 11 million flu cases nationwide this flu season, marking the highest levels in three decades. The latest &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/overview/fluview-interactive.html"&gt;CDC report&lt;/a&gt; places Idaho among states seeing some of the highest rates of flu activity.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The holidays, people are traveling a lot, and so you get exposed when you're traveling to all types of things," Butler-Dawson said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surge is connected to a new strain of the influenza virus called "Subclade K," which some health officials have nicknamed the "super flu."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The disease is more severe," Butler-Dawson said. "Our flu vaccine isn't a perfect match this year. The vaccine that was made wasn't accounting for this Subclade K variant."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Hailey Hampton, a Meridian resident, this flu season has been unlike any other.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This year does feel different. It came on pretty strongly," Hampton said. "Kind of just felt like I got hit by a truck basically."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hampton came down with what she believes was the flu around Christmas Eve, experiencing "bad head congestion, sinus headache" and feeling "just really lethargic and lots of pressure in my upper respiratory."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hampton is the only person in her family of four who got a flu shot this season. Just days after she got sick, her husband, Nick, fell ill as well.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That cough, instead of being progressive, it just kind of went lower and lower and lower," Hampton said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His symptoms were more severe. After going to the doctor for an X-ray, he was diagnosed with pneumonia. Hampton's husband is still recovering, while she recovered much quicker. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butler-Dawson said it's likely Hampton's symptoms were less severe than her husband's because she received a flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's still going to reduce severe illnesses and hospitalizations," Butler-Dawson said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hampton's two daughters, Vivi and Coco, managed to avoid getting sick despite not receiving flu shots. But said many of their classmates are returning to school from winter break with symptoms including "coughing and stuffy noses."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butler-Dawson said hospitals in Ada County are seeing significantly more people seeking treatment for the flu compared to last year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Last year, on average, you know, we're seeing in Ada County at the hospitals, the daily data counts are averaging around 10. And right now we're at like 45," Butler-Dawson said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Christmas Eve, at least three people in Ada County have died from flu related complications, according to Butler-Dawson.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is concerning and scary," she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials attribute Idaho's elevated flu rates to multiple factors.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have the new variant, which probably a lot of people here aren't exposed to. I would say on average, our vaccination rates are lower than other states," Butler-Dawson said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the vaccine not being a perfect match for the subclade K variant, health officials urge residents to get vaccinated because it can help alleviate flu symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Try to protect your family and your community. Cover your cough and your sneezes, just basic hygiene, washing your hands, just so we reduce the spread of the flu," Butler-Dawson said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flu season typically runs through March. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

Vaccines for children will now be split into three categories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC now recommends dividing vaccinations for children into three categories: universally recommended vaccines that all children should receive, vaccines for children that are high risk and vaccines that should be discussed as a shared decision with a child's provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For example, the CDC now recommends the rotavirus and flu vaccines only be given to a child if a doctor recommends them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The remaining universally recommended vaccines include those for measles, mumps, rubella, polio, pertussis, tetanus, diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), pneumococcal disease, human papillomavirus (HPV), and varicella (chickenpox).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;4. Medical groups are speaking out against changes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Medical groups like the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2025/aap-opposes-federal-health-officials-unprecedented-move-to-remove-universal-childhood-immunization-recommendations/" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;u class=" "&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are calling the updates to the kids vaccine schedule "dangerous and unnecessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Molly O'Shea, a pediatrician and AAP spokesperson, told ABC News the vaccination schedule updates may also have secondary impacts, including how often children and families see their pediatrician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Whether or not a parent's going to opt in or opt out of vaccines, children still need their wellness visit," O'Shea said. "Absent vaccines, kids are really going to miss out on important other screening aspects of the wellness visits if their parents are opting out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In a separate statement, the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2026/idsa-statement-on-childhood-vaccine-schedule/" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;u class=" "&gt;Infectious Diseases Society of America&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; spoke out against the changes to the childhood vaccination schedule, saying they will "put families and communities at risk and will make America sicker."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Making these changes amid ongoing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases shows a disregard for the real confusion families already face," IDSA President Dr. Ronald G. Nahass said in part. "Disease prevalence differs country to country, and there has been demonstrated and ongoing need in the U.S. for the vaccines included in the childhood vaccine schedule. Most other high-income countries have universal health care and parental leave, both of which can support prevention and early care and contribute to lower disease prevalence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In a statement, the American Lung Association said it is "deeply concerned about the changes made to the childhood immunization schedule." The organization specifically criticized the decision to no longer recommend the flu shot for all kids without any science to support the change amid record-breaking spikes in flu illnesses this season, and the most pediatric flu deaths ever recorded last season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The Lung Association continues to urge that everyone over six months get vaccinated for influenza and COVID-19," the organization stated. "Vaccination remains one of the most effective tools to protect children from serious illness, hospitalization and death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;5. What parents with questions can do&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Medical professionals recommend parents and caregivers talk to their child's pediatrician, who will continue to make expert recommendations. Parents should still bring their children to the doctor for wellness visits, regardless of their immunization preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The changes by the CDC are recommendations and have never been mandatory. Parents can still seek previously recommended vaccines for children, in consultation with their kids' pediatrician. &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2026/2026-cdc-acts-on-presidential-memorandum-to-update-childhood-immunization-schedule.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;HHS officials&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/fact-sheet-cdc-childhood-immunization-recommendations.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;the CDC&lt;/a&gt; also said the changes will not affect health insurance coverage of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;"Your pediatrician really is your trusted source of information and we have nothing to gain in the way things are going here," O'Shea said. "Vaccines are certainly not a way in which we make any money.

								&lt;p&gt;New London, NH – Allyn B Maffee, 76, passed away peacefully on December 31 at the Jack Byrne Center in Lebanon with his daughter at his side after a brief illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born August 25,1949 in Nashua, New Hampshire, he was the son of the late John “Nick” Maffee and Olive Maffee of Milford, NH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allyn grew up in Milford, NH working with his father at Maffee’s Garage where he fell in love with working on cars. He graduated from Milford High School then attended Hesser College earning a degree in Business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After decades in business and sales, Allyn reached a turning point at 50 years of age. Driven by his lifelong passion for cars, he opened Allyn’s North Elm Service in Manchester. His commitment to quality quickly earned him a stellar reputation, attracting even Manchester’s police and fire personnel who trusted him with their personal vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He and his wife Pamela shared a life rich with exploration and joy–journeys to their beloved retreat in Nova Scotia with their golden retrievers, meandering through the iconic covered bridges of New Hampshire and Vermont, annual pilgrimages to Pittsburg, NH to indulge his love for fly-fishing, and ultimately finding their forever home in New London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren remember him as a gentle father and grandfather with a tremendous sense of humor, a great story-teller with an infectious laugh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allyn is predeceased by his parents John and Olive Maffee of Milford, son Brian Maffee of Milford, and his wife Pamela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surviving family members include his daughter, Kimberly McGrath-Chase, and her husband Alan of Dunstable, Massachusetts, and grandchildren, Harrison McGrath of Milan Italy, Grace McGrath of Dunstable, Tristan Chase of Manchester and Owen Chase. Allyn also leaves behind a beautiful 5-year-old golden retriever, Josie, who will be loved and cared for by Allyn’s daughter Kimberly and her family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A funeral will be held in May at Rochester Cemetery, Rochester, NH, with a celebration of life to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All are welcome to join the family to celebrate Allyn’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lieu of flowers, please send donations to Jack Byrne Center of Lebanon or Pope Memorial SPCA of Concord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stay informed about arrangements and to honor Allyn’s memory, please visit the online guestbook at http://www.chadwickfuneralservice.com&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The fungal compound verticillin A, discovered &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D3NP00068K"&gt;more than 50 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, has long been regarded for its potential cancer-fighting capabilities. S&lt;span&gt;cientists have now managed to artificially synthesize the compound for the first time, meaning they can study it in more detail and potentially &lt;/span&gt;develop &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-breakthrough-treatment-safely-kills-cancer-cells-with-light"&gt;new cancer treatments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to produce verticillin A on demand in the lab is a major step forward. In nature, it's found only in small amounts in a microscopic fungus and is very difficult to extract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before now, the complex chemical structure and inherent instability of verticillin A made it tricky to synthesize, but researchers from MIT and Harvard Medical School have overcome both problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/blocking-one-protein-slows-cancer-growth-in-mice-scientists-discover"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blocking One Protein Slows Cancer Growth in Mice, Scientists Discover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key was finding a way to rework the approach MIT chemist Mohammad Movassaghi had used before to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1170777"&gt;synthesize similar compounds&lt;/a&gt;, which differed from verticillin A by just a few atoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_187782" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-187782" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/CompoundMolecule.jpg" alt="Verticillin A" class="wp-image-187782 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/CompoundMolecule.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/CompoundMolecule-600x456.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-187782" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The end goal, verticillin A, with its two identical halves.

Sounds simple to make, but verticillin A's 3D structure must be &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereochemistry"&gt;precisely arranged&lt;/a&gt; for the compound to form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build verticillin A, the researchers used a few tricks, switching up the order in which they added molecules and protecting fragile bonds from being broken during synthesis. Their 16-step process, which 'unmasked' some of verticillin A's functional groups after its two halves had been brought together, gave the researchers the precise 3D structure they needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we learned was the timing of the events is absolutely critical," &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-chemists-synthesize-fungal-compound-holds-promise-treating-brain-cancer-1203"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Movassaghi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had to significantly change the order of the bond-forming events."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested their new synthetic compound and several variations of it on lab-grown cells of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_midline_glioma"&gt;diffuse midline glioma&lt;/a&gt; (DMG), an aggressive brain  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="187779" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; affecting children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molecules related to verticillin A had &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1158/1538-7445.PEDCA17-A47"&gt;previously shown&lt;/a&gt; promise in killing DMG cells, and this was again observed in the new tests on lab-grown cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A closer analysis also revealed that the new synthetic compound was hitting its intended protein targets inside the cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that verticillin A has been synthesized for the first time, the work to understand how it &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-destroy-99-of-cancer-cells-in-lab-using-vibrating-molecules"&gt;interacts with cancer&lt;/a&gt; and how it could be adapted into treatments can be taken to a whole new level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Natural compounds have been valuable resources for drug discovery, and we will fully evaluate the therapeutic potential of these molecules by integrating our expertise in chemistry, chemical biology, cancer biology, and patient care," &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-chemists-synthesize-fungal-compound-holds-promise-treating-brain-cancer-1203"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; chemical biologist Jun Qi, from Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c16112"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;New federal recommendations have expanded testing options for HPV, which can cause cervical cancer, and bring them right to your front door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women can still choose to get a pelvic exam at the doctor’s office, or they can now use a self-collection kit. HPV testing is the preferred cervical cancer screening method for women ages 30 to 65.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“HPV is the cause of cervical cancer, and anywhere from 95 to 99% of cervical cancer,” said Dr. Ebony Hoskins, section director of gynecologic oncology at MedStar Washington Hospital Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the Health Resources and Services Administration released the new cervical cancer screening guidelines. In an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2843501?guestAccessKey=f786e491-32e8-4673-a928-9af3924fefc7&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=010526" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;article published in JAMA&lt;/a&gt;, the administration said self-collection “is an important and innovative breakthrough in the fight against cervical cancer and has the potential to increase screening rates and save lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.getteal.com/teal-wand" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Teal Wand&lt;/a&gt; is an FDA-approved device for at-home cervical cancer screening. It works like a tampon, allowing women to collect their own sample and then turn it over to a laboratory for testing, with support from a virtual medical provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The test is accurate. And with that test, patients who used it found it more satisfactory to have the test administered at home,” Hoskins said. “I felt more reassured that they have providers to help guide the patient on how to do it, what the results mean if they need any follow-up care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She recommended regular gynecological visits and talking to your physician, but said certain patients may benefit from an at-home test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are some people who have anxiety about doing pelvic exams,” she said. “They have transportation issues that prohibit coming into the office.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Teal Wand costs $250, but insurance plans must cover the self‑collection kit starting Jan. 1, 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 4,000 women die each year from cervical cancer in the U.S. and about 13,000 new cases are diagnosed. About 20% of cervical cancer occurs in women after the age of 65, an age when most women are no longer screened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is very important to get tested and screened because cervical cancer is preventable,” Dr. Hoskins said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a &lt;a href="https://cervivor.org/what-we-do/cervical-cancer-summit-powered-by-cervivor-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cervical Cancer Summit in D.C&lt;/a&gt;. at the end of January for patients, survivors, caregivers and advocates.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://escapecollective.com/so-you-want-to-lose-weight-this-year/"&gt;previous installment&lt;/a&gt; of this series, I discussed the potential problems with the common new year’s resolution of trying to lose weight. As a (very brief recap), this is an often-planned but rarely accomplished goal. Weight loss, for a range of biological, psychological, and social reasons, is statistically speaking incredibly difficult to achieve and maintain over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process of weight loss also comes with potential consequences for physical and mental health and performance for cyclists, especially if you’re going into a big calorie deficit to try and get there quickly. And finally, weight loss is a desired outcome, not a strategy, process or behaviour – without a plan (i.e. accompanying process goals), it’s no more than wishful thinking.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s not to say reducing body fat can never be achieved, nor is it always harmful. It can be done for many cyclists, and with a bit of thought and planning, can be accomplished with no or minimal impact on your health or performance on the bike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's now take a look at some suggestions to make that new year’s resolution safer, more effective, and more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="don%E2%80%99t-make-body-size-shape-or-weight-your-only-or-most-important-goal"&gt;Don’t make body size, shape or weight your only (or most important) goal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might sound repetitive from the previous piece, but it’s worth reiterating. You can do all the right things, nail all your processes, and still not achieve your desired weight-loss outcomes (more on why below). So don’t make it your only goal, or even the main one. Think about the other things you’d like to achieve that are not predicated on hitting a certain number on the scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s feeling stronger on the bike. Maybe it’s having more energy off it. Maybe it’s lowering your blood pressure, or your cholesterol. All of these things can be achieved with or without weight change, and they’re statistically more likely to be successful too. So add them to your new year’s resolution, and maximise your chances of feeling successful.&lt;/p&gt;

There can be a small cognitive boost &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30560422/"&gt;immediately after a workout&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6404470/"&gt;effects are sustained&lt;/a&gt; if people &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7357295/"&gt;exercise consistently&lt;/a&gt;. And while staying active can’t guarantee you won’t develop dementia, over the long term, it is associated with a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2841638"&gt;lower risk&lt;/a&gt; of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Researchers think that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40157803/"&gt;moving your muscles benefits your brain&lt;/a&gt; in part because of special signaling molecules called exerkines. During and after a workout, your muscles, fat and other organs release these molecules into the bloodstream, some of which make their way up to the brain. There, those exerkines go to work, helping to facilitate the growth of new connections between neurons, the repair of brain cells and, possibly, the birth of new neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Exercise also appears to improve blood flow in the brain. That ramps up the delivery of good things to brain cells, like oxygen, glucose and those amazing exerkines. And it helps remove more bad things, namely toxic proteins, like amyloid, that can build up and damage brain cells, increasing the risk for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;All of the changes brought on by exercise are “essentially allowing your brain to age more slowly than if you’re physically inactive,” said Kirk Erickson, the chair of neuroscience at the AdventHealth Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;The benefits are particularly pronounced in the hippocampus, a region critical for learning and memory. In older adults, the hippocampus shrinks 1 to 2 percent a year, and it is one of the main areas affected by Alzheimer’s. Researchers think physical activity helps to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3041121/"&gt;offset some of that loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;The best exercise you can do for your brain is the one you’ll do consistently, so find something that you enjoy and that fits easily into your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Walking is one option; two neurologists I spoke to said they got their exercise in by walking at least part of the way to their offices. Recent research suggests that just &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/well/mind/dementia-steps-study.html"&gt;a few thousand steps a day&lt;/a&gt; can reduce the risk of dementia. It’s important to get your heart rate up, though, so “walk as though you’re trying to get somewhere on time,” said Dr. Linda Selwa, a clinical professor of neurology at the University of Michigan Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Or you could try swimming, cycling, Pilates, weight lifting, yoga, pickleball, dancing, gardening — any type of physical exertion can be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;If the thought of working out feels like a drag, try pairing it with something else you enjoy doing, like listening to an audiobook. This is a trick that Katherine Milkman, a professor who studies habits at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, calls “temptation bundling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;For Day 3, we’re asking you to spend at least 20 minutes exercising for your brain. Go for a walk with your accountability partner if they’re nearby. (If not, call them and do a walk-and-talk.) Or let us find you a new workout to try, using the tool below. As usual, we can all meet in the comments to catch up and check in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

These molecules speed up &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-holy-grail-protein-repairs-dna-and-could-lead-to-a-cancer-vaccine"&gt;DNA repair&lt;/a&gt; and dial down genes related to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="187654" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This results in a shift in blood chemistry, triggered by exercise, that potentially slows the growth and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-a-new-unexpected-way-that-cancer-cells-spread"&gt;spread of cancer&lt;/a&gt;.

The child, whose name has not been released, was exposed out of state and is not believed to have caught it locally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The patient was seen by the Madison Health ER for symptoms of measles and was not hospitalized,” health officials say. “Madison Health has reached out to those who were potentially exposed, all of whom were educated by infection control specialists.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The family reportedly self-isolated during the infectious period to avoiding spreading it. The household is still being monitored, but officials say they are no longer contagious. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although measles is considered a childhood disease, it can be contracted at any age. The virus can easily spread through the air and can survive up to two hours. Symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes and a downward-moving rash starting at the head. Infection can spread four days before and after the rash appears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Measles is very contagious. Up to 90% of people exposed to it may contract measles if not protected&lt;br&gt; against it,” EIPH nurse Rachel Mugleston says in the release. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those who have been vaccinated, previously had measles or who were born before 1957 are considered immune to the measles virus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About one in five unvaccinated people in the U.S. who have measles is hospitalized. Eastern Idaho Public Health officials say the best way to protect yourself and others is by getting vaccinated. It’s 97% effective after two doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you believe you may have been exposed to anyone with measles, contact your health care provider, and monitor yourself for symptoms for 21 days after exposure. It is extremely important to call before arriving in person due to the contagious nature of the measles virus,” health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>East Idaho News</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 23:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxOMW1Jamp3bHF4dzNjWkpnYWVDSG5fdE1ETGpxbDZodkRlT0F4eEhkRXFlV1NZUk50bzVxdkU1OEMyekFQWVhnOWcyeVN5NERXVy0yZVlDcWNsUUw1eDAydmRCcVFSTERsVkFWb0QwbjQxdFFkeWpPbmxjb3c5N3hQYjI4bDAxak01OXA3WUp2bGQ3UGVJSEJVZUw4Nm1xdV9n</guid></item><item><title>马萨诸塞州官员宣布检测到禽流感- WJAR</title><link>https://turnto10.com/news/local/massachusetts-officials-announce-detection-avian-influenza-dukes-county-agricultural-resources-january-6-2026</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h2 class="StoryPage_headline__AP3j8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts officials announce detection of Avian Influenza &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="ByLineContainer_storyBylineContainer__0JNT7" id="js-Story-Byline-0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="ByLine_storyByLineText__cze7l"&gt;by ALEXIS ROSSI, NBC 10 NEWS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="ByLineContainer_storyDatelineText__yS9e8"&gt;Tue, January 6, 2026 at 6:32 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="UserWayButton_userWayButton__h8S9a ByLineContainer_userWayButton___vCFL"&gt;&lt;img alt="UserWay icon for accessibility widget" src="/resources/defaults/news_3.0/icons/accessibility/userway-transparent.svg"&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WJAR</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 23:35:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2AFBVV95cUxNZ0ZaM25hZGdBMWlhemw0c3BUWnp0VTBiY1RnNUx1NFBGVmNqSTNGU2kwVmZ1QklYOXBCYWlkRUs3Vk02cTQwa3lod3ZzSm56T0dGcmhxbHBhR0dSUS03RlpqaVVoaDN1RnE3VXdPVkpyNy0zQ2hMc3UtcUFSLUJGZE82b04xWXFWUG5HZ0ozaVhubTgzS0hoZ3h2WHBlQnZKcGFUUzdKUzVZRGVlTi02YTFQSVAxOTBKYmZrUHVFZlNkUE5mQVZVZ3hIaV9xNF9FQm9XblRuUUY</guid></item><item><title>随着官员敦促接种疫苗，费城、宾夕法尼亚州、新泽西州和特拉华州的流感病例激增-费城6abc</title><link>https://6abc.com/post/flu-cases-surge-philadelphia-pennsylvania-new-jersey-delaware-officials-urge-vaccinations/18362899/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;&lt;span class="oyrPY qlwaB AGxeB  "&gt;HAVERTOWN, Pa.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1qf2cu001w336pyoinz70f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After the Trump administration announced sweeping changes to the US childhood vaccine schedule this week, parents and pediatricians are trying to make sense of what’s driving the change and how it will affect families.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1s7tia000l3b6s3qb9a89b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s what’s known so far:
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1qbd3a0003336pzvbkkzsr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Department of Health and Human Services is changing the childhood vaccine schedule — a set of recommendations from the federal government about what immunizations children should get and when &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; to scale back the number of vaccines broadly recommended for children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1s9095000n3b6sra7jgf52@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These are recommendations, not mandates, but the schedule is typically used to guide which vaccines states require for day care or public school, as well as which vaccines are covered by insurance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1s9hja000p3b6s61rugnyc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new schedule recommends that healthy children get 11 vaccines — fewer than were previously recommended broadly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk2w54qr00003b6t1kat69eu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, polio, chickenpox, HPV and others continue to be broadly recommended. But there are narrower recommendations for vaccination against meningococcal disease, hepatitis B and hepatitis A to children who are at higher risk for infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk2wd9tq00043b6tu9oykuai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They recommend that choices on vaccinations against flu, Covid-19 and rotavirus be based on “shared clinical decision-making,” which means people who want one must consult with a health care provider first.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1qbd3a000e336pcyfjhjx5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS says insurers will still have to cover all vaccines recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as of December 31, 2025, without cost-sharing. Parents may incur additional costs if they have to speak to a health care provider first.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk305m52000d3b6thro4muv9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vaccine schedule is a set of recommendations from federal officials. It doesn’t make kids get certain shots, nor does it forbid them from getting others. So parents should technically be able to get their children vaccinated according to the previous schedule.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk354ll40004336q3pard6fu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say it’s especially important now to have a good conversation with the child’s pediatrician about what shots they suggest.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk35x1ot00013b6te3kf9v3x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Parents should trust their pediatrician, trust the professional societies like the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians. But for now, unfortunately, we have to ignore everything about vaccines that is coming from our federal government,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the American Association of Pediatrics’ Committee on Infectious Diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk34xr4n0002336q3ofefe78@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The AAP says it will continue to publish its own &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Recommended-Immunization-Schedules.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Recommended Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule&lt;/a&gt;, which is much broader than the government’s shortened list. It includes a yearly flu shot and updated Covid-19 vaccinations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk30cdu700143b6t41ep319m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            O’Leary, who’s also a pediatrician in Colorado, thinks things shouldn’t change too much here. Most pediatricians will continue to follow the broader AAP schedule, he says, but adding so many vaccines to the “shared decision-making” category has created some confusion among clinicians.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk35id430008336qhh2qaknp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some medical practices may take additional steps such as having parents sign documents that say they acknowledge the shots are now in a different category. It may also be a little harder to find some of those vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk35f6mj0006336qs1srqglj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In previous years, when a handful of shots fell into the “shared decision-making” category, medical offices didn’t always keep those in stock, O’Leary said. “But this move by the government is unprecedented, so it’s hard to predict what will happen.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk35pxl5000a336qkjyq8ool@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When there are tiers of recommendations, “it suggests that some vaccines are more important than others,” he said. “So I wouldn’t be surprised if this decreases access to some vaccines.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1qbd3a000g336pagn2kdat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new schedule wasn’t driven by any new evidence on the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. In December, President Donald Trump ordered HHS to review the schedule along with those of other developed nations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1qbd3a000h336pp8w0xs56@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS says that reducing the number of vaccines for children gives parents more “flexibility and choice, with less coercion.” HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has been an outspoken vaccine skeptic for years, also said the change to the schedule “protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1qbd3a000k336po7onnuqc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS leaders said they spoke with officials in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;several other wealthy countries, including Germany, Denmark and Japan, in addition to experts at the CDC, and found that the US recommends several more vaccines than some other nations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1ygjp1001n3b6s1p765o6a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg, acting director of the US Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, gave a presentation to the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee about the Danish vaccine schedule last month. Hoeg, a dual citizen of the US and Denmark, noted that with fewer vaccines, there’s less exposure to aluminum, which is used as an ingredient to create a stronger immune response so doctors can give kids fewer doses. Despite broad evidence that using such adjuvants are safe, Kennedy has argued that aluminum in vaccines is linked to allergies and other health problems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk2wk7el00073b6tdp2rhpyf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, Danish vaccine experts said Denmark is a poor blueprint for US vaccine policy because it has a different health care system, including more accessible prenatal and childhood care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk30q747001e3b6t9o7eqdzs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Trump said on Truth Social on Monday that the new schedule is rooted in science “widely agreed upon by Scientists and Experts all over the World,” but many doctors and public health officials immediately spoke out against the change.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1qbd3a000n336p7fjfvdv1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The American Academy of Pediatrics opposes the changes to the childhood vaccine schedule, with President Dr. Andrew Racine calling them “dangerous and unnecessary.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1qbd3a000o336pbtaa0yhj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The longstanding, evidence-based approach that has guided the U.S. immunization review and recommendation process remains the best way to keep children healthy and protect against health complications and hospitalizations,” Racine said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1qbd3a000p336plnyyjeb8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Today’s decision, which was based on a brief review of other countries’ practices, upends this deliberate scientific process,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1supfc0000336piu8dpg2p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, trustee of the American Medical Association said that organization is “deeply concerned” about the changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1ylaci001p3b6swlilx0zv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The scientific evidence remains unchanged, and the AMA supports continued access to childhood immunizations recommended by national medical specialty societies,” she said in a statement. “Changes of this magnitude require careful review, expert and public input, and clear scientific justification. That level of rigor and transparency was not part of this decision. When longstanding recommendations are altered without a robust, evidence-based process, it undermines public trust and puts children at unnecessary risk of preventable disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1uik0g0006336pq4ij32p0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Infectious Diseases Society of America called the changes “reckless” and characterized the decision as an “assault on the national vaccine infrastructure that has saved millions of lives.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1undhf0009336p8axfty49@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Upending long-standing vaccine recommendations without transparent public review and engagement with external experts will undermine confidence in vaccines with the likely outcome of decreasing vaccination rates and increasing disease,” President Dr. Ronald Nahass said in a statement. “Making these changes amid ongoing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases shows a disregard for the real confusion families already face.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk1upe2u000c336pssuu5rkl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is irresponsible to haphazardly change vaccine recommendations without a solid scientific basis and transparent process. The commitment the U.S. has made to protecting children from vaccine-preventable illness and death must remain a top priority,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk3091te000j3b6tszy4vfcf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Mandy Cohen, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the “shift in vaccine recommendations from HHS adds confusion and unnecessary obstacles for families who want their kids protected from serious illness. I am saddened to see our country take a step backwards in its efforts to protect the health of children and families.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk30bh3z000p3b6t6rln0nl9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In years past, changes to the vaccine schedule would happen after the CDC’s committee of independent advisers weighed whether to update the schedule based on the latest scientific evidence and CDC leadership finalized recommendations and schedules.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk30c3ux00113b6ti0e67y2a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Under Kennedy, there have already been changes to recommendations for some vaccines, including Covid-19, hepatitis B and the combination measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk30br8q000v3b6t62bsz503@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last year, Kennedy fired all the members of CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and replaced them with his own picks, many of whom share his vaccine skepticism. He also fired the CDC director, who typically signs off on that agency’s vaccine recommendations. The new committee has said it will continue reassess even long-established vaccine data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk30by79000y3b6truxcq2x8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Future HHS leaders could always make a decision to change the vaccine schedule back, according to Dorit Reiss, a professor of law and the James Edgar Hervey Chair in Litigation at UC Law San Francisco, who studies laws around vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk30j95e00163b6tmwhxj1gk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Reiss said in an email to CNN that the new changes have “set a precedent that, unless it’s challenged in courts, can be reversed by the next administration.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drinking wine every day can affect sleep, energy, weight, and long-term health, with risks increasing as intake goes beyond one small glass.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While wine contains antioxidants, you’d need to drink more than is healthy to see real benefits—similar perks can come from fruits, vegetables, coffee, or tea instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enjoying wine occasionally, rather than daily, is the safer approach, especially when paired with meals and balanced with alcohol-free days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether celebrating, unwinding after a long day, or enjoying happy hour with friends, many Americans look forward to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/shopping-storing/beverages/healthiest-wines" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;a glass of wine&lt;/a&gt; on a weekly—and sometimes even daily—basis. And with endless &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/shopping-storing/beverages/healthiest-wines" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;wine varieties &lt;/a&gt;and regions across the globe, learning about wine can even be a hobby for some.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “A glass of wine can be relaxing and enjoyable, and should be a personal choice,” assures Jordan Langhough, registered dietitian and owner of Jordan Langhough Nutrition &amp;amp; Fitness. However, while sipping wine is a fun way to connect and decompress, there are plenty of reasons why it shouldn’t be consumed in excess. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But what does “excess” mean exactly? Does drinking wine every day qualify? And what happens to the body with daily consumption? To find out, we spoke with a handful of registered dietitians to answer these questions—and explore what amount of wine is a safer bet for regular consumption.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no question that drinking wine is a fun activity, but when we drink it everyday there can be some less-than-glamorous side effects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you are a daily wine drinker, you are considered to be &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/what-it-means-to-drink-in-moderation-8768937" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;a moderate drinker&lt;/a&gt;. This has historically been considered relatively low risk for adverse health conditions. However, increasing the amount of wine per day beyond one glass can start to negatively impact your health,” explains Langhough.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And there are actually several body systems affected by alcohol. “It can negatively impact the liver, brain, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-drinks-for-gut-health-11875062" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut&lt;/a&gt;, heart, and nervous system.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, higher or regular alcohol intake is linked to increased cancer risk, particularly breast cancer and cancers of the gastrointestinal tract,&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;” explains Val Warner, MS, RD, CSSD, CPT, dietitian and founder of Wellness by Val.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But that’s not all. “Alcohol impairs judgement, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/simple-strategies-to-boost-your-memory-11823365" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and coordination. Long-term use contributes to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/age-brain-declines-study-11706222" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;, depression&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and risk for alcohol dependence,” says registered dietitian Juliana Vocca, MS, RD. Daily drinking can turn into a deeply ingrained habit, leaving some people at risk for overconsumption without even realizing it. “Over time, this habit will start to negatively affect &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/things-to-do-before-bed-11711950" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, energy levels, weight, digestion, and overall health,” says Warner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, with anywhere from 120 to 150 calories per glass, the empty calories from wine can add up quickly—potentially contributing to weight gain. “It can worsen insulin resistance and raise the risk of type 2 diabetes when consumed excessively&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;—while also weakening the &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-vegetable-for-immunity-8757152" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;, making the body more susceptible to infections,” adds Vocca.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even at low doses (i.e. less than one glass per day) alcohol can still have negative effects. In fact, in 2023 the World Health Organization (WHO) deemed no level of alcohol consumption to be safe for health.&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, wine may have a slight edge over other alcoholic beverages on the health front. “Wine, especially &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/red-wine-health-benefits" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;red wine&lt;/a&gt;, contains polyphenols and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-with-more-antioxidants-than-blueberries-11773725" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;—most notably resveratrol,” shares Langhough. These compounds may benefit heart health&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by improving blood vessel function, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/anti-inflammatory-lifestyle-habits-11769931" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;reducing inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, and boosting your HDL (high-density lipoprotein, or ‘good’) cholesterol levels.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, there’s a catch. “The downside is that you would have to drink a significant amount of red wine to actually benefit from the polyphenols and antioxidants—so much so that the amount of alcohol consumed would be detrimental to your health,” Langhough explains. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And while other research has linked moderate wine consumption to lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes when consumed with food&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, “an individual can achieve similar benefits through foods such as &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-fruits-and-vegetables-for-immune-support-11879162" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, and daily exercise such as walking,” Langhough adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-many-glasses-of-wine-is-too-much"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Many Glasses of Wine Is Too Much?  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there’s plenty to love about wine, the bottom line is that even small amounts can have drawbacks when it comes to health. That said, it’s all about balance—so how much is okay, and when does it cross the line?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “An occasional glass, especially when paired with a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle, may offer some slight antioxidant benefits from grape polyphenols and can play a role in social connection,” says Warner. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Langhough and Vocca agree with this one-glass rule. “A standard serving of wine is five ounces. In the United States, a moderate amount is considered one glass of wine for women and two glasses of wine for men per day.&lt;span data-cite="10" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Any glasses above the moderate definition would be considered too many, and would increase the risk of negative health consequences,” shares Langhough.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Occasional moderate use is far safer than making wine &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/daily-habits-that-will-make-you-happier-11862093" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;a daily habit&lt;/a&gt;,” adds Vocca. A very safe bet would be to aim for &lt;strong&gt;one to two glasses on a weekly—not daily—basis&lt;/strong&gt;. Up to four drinks per week would even be a big improvement from a glass or two per day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And how many is absolutely too many? “For women, four or more glasses per day, or eight or more per week is considered heavy drinking. Heavy drinking for men consists of five or more per day, or 15 or more per week,” says Warner. Once these thresholds are exceeded, the most concerning health effects of alcohol become far more likely.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, while drinking wine every day isn’t the best choice, you can still enjoy it in moderation. These RDs offer some tips and tricks for putting this intention into practice. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Having wine alongside &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-sources-of-protein-8775868" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, vegetables, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats helps stabilize blood sugar and slows the rate at which alcohol is absorbed,” suggests Warner. “Timing also matters: limiting alcohol earlier in the evening and having your last drink around six to seven pm gives your body time to metabolize it before sleep, depending on the amount consumed. This can support better sleep quality and reduce next-day fatigue or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/mind-mood/brain-fog" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;brain fog&lt;/a&gt;.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can also skip the wine altogether, and obtain the antioxidants it's known for from more nourishing places in the diet. “You can get the same—or better—antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits from &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health-benefits-of-grapes-7504033" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;grapes&lt;/a&gt;, blueberries, cranberries, coffee, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health-benefits-of-drinking-tea-every-day-11766446" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;tea&lt;/a&gt;, and other plant foods without the risks of alcohol. About a cup of grapes with the skin on can provide a similar amount of resveratrol (an antioxidant) as a glass of wine&lt;span data-cite="11" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,” says Vocca. Plus, these foods provide other beneficial nutrients—such as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/dietitians-favorite-high-fiber-foods-11819806" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, vitamins, and minerals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And if you’d like to enjoy a drink with friends without the alcohol, there are plenty of alternatives. “Grape juice and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-tea-to-drink-daily-8608683" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;herbal teas&lt;/a&gt; are great options, as they provide polyphenols and antioxidants without the health risks that come with alcohol,” adds Langhough. Any other (low added sugar) &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/mocktails-for-sober-october-8709680" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;mocktail&lt;/a&gt;, juice, or non-alcoholic spirit options work here, too.
