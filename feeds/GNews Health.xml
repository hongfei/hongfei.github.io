 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors have not been able to identify a single or even a handful of causes for precocious puberty, though experts have previously told MailOnline that some underlying factors include obesity, stress, and genetics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the study, the scientists assessed 1,407 Taiwanese teens, who undertook diet questionnaires and urine tests, and discovered 481 had undergone early puberty. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They found the artificial sweetener sucralose showed a stronger link with early puberty in boys, while aspartame, glycyrrhizin and regular added sugars showed a stronger link in girls. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts also found t&lt;/span&gt;he risk was most pronounced in those who already had a genetic predisposition towards an earlier puberty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was presented at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, and has yet to be published in full. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But common limitations of diet studies include the fact eating habits are often self-reported.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sucralose is made from normal sucrose table sugar but is chemically altered so the body doesn't process it as a carbohydrate, meaning that it contains no calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is the main ingredient in the Canderel sweetener. Glycyrrhizin, on the other hand, comes from liquorice roots and is a natural sweetener.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research from the same team found that some sweeteners can affect the release of puberty-related hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The risk was most pronounced in those who already had a genetic predisposition towards an earlier puberty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Particular products containing aspartame — which entered the market in the 1980s — include Diet Coke, Dr Pepper as well as Extra chewing gum and Muller Light yoghurts. Some toothpastes, dessert mixes, and sugar-free cough drops also contain it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said the chemicals were having this effect by influencing the function of cells in the brain or by altering the make-up of bacteria in the gut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Concerns about the impact artificial sweeteners, which are added a plethora of products to make them TAST sweet with fewer calories, could be having health, including its cardiovascular impact, have circulated for years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But critics highlight such studies are only observational, meaning they are unable to prove artificial sweeteners are the culprit and cannot rule out other external factors being to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fears have also been raised about links between artificial sweeteners and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These worries were heightened in 2023 after the World Health Organisation controversially classified the artificial sweetener aspartame, found in drinks like Diet Coke, as&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12299515/Outrage-unnecessary-fears-sparked-WHOs-aspartame-cancer-ruling.html"&gt; 'possibly carcinogenic to humans'&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the UN agency ruled it only posed a risk to those who consumed massive amounts and that an 11 stone (70kg) adult could safely drink about 14 cans a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A growing body of research also suggests that girls who go through puberty at earlier ages could be at risk for health issues later in life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2023 US study found that girls who started their period before the age of 13 were at a higher risk of developing type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-7ad589e0-623c-11f0-af39-83939e4799b9"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and suffering strokes in adulthood than their peers who began menstruating later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another, published in the Lancet, found that girls who started their periods at early ages were at an increased risk of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have put the surge in girls starting puberty younger down to the ongoing obesity crisis, with fat cells containing hormonal properties triggering puberty at a younger age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Marketed as quick fixes for fatigue and performance dips, energy drinks are especially popular among &lt;a href="https://www.childpsych.theclinics.com/article/S1056-4993(10)00031-3/abstract"&gt;young people&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/use-of-energy-drinks-in-sport-perceived-ergogenicity-and-side-effects-in-male-and-female-athletes/335349F12D8EBE19FA91B032546ADC87"&gt;athletes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7563047/"&gt;sports enthusiasts&lt;/a&gt;, and so-called "&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2966367/"&gt;weekend warriors&lt;/a&gt;" – people who pack their workouts into the weekend instead of exercising regularly. &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12152-020-09442-8"&gt;Gamers&lt;/a&gt; are now a major target too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as the market grows, so do concerns about what's actually in these drinks – and what these &lt;a href="https://nutrition.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk426/files/content/infosheets/fact-pro-energydrinks.pdf"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt; might be doing to our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many energy drinks contain some combination of three familiar stimulants: &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519490/"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, found naturally in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="168042" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt;, tea and cacao; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378874113005771"&gt;guarana&lt;/a&gt;, an Amazonian plant rich in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="168042" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/taurine"&gt;taurine&lt;/a&gt;, a naturally occurring amino acid found in scallops, mussels, turkey and chicken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-unexpected-link-between-diet-and-lung-cancer-risk?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Scientists Discover Unexpected Link Between Diet And Lung Cancer Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taurine, in particular, has drawn both hype and hope. It is credited with &lt;a href="https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-021-00438-0#Abs1"&gt;performance-enhancing properties&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10574552/#abstract1"&gt;potential health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. But new research is raising important questions about how it behaves in the body – and when it might do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2025, a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-07711-z"&gt;study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sparked headlines and unease in equal measure. It found that taurine may fuel the progression of &lt;a href="https://bloodcancer.org.uk/understanding-blood-cancer/leukaemia/"&gt;leukaemia&lt;/a&gt;, a group of blood cancers that begin in the bone marrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed that while healthy bone marrow cells naturally produce taurine, leukaemia cells cannot. But they can absorb taurine from their surroundings and use it as a fuel source to grow and multiply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research on mice and in human leukaemia cell samples demonstrated that taurine in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8194051/"&gt;tumour microenvironment&lt;/a&gt; – the area around a tumour that includes blood vessels, immune cells and structural support – accelerated the progression of leukaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, when researchers blocked taurine uptake by leukaemia cells (using genetic techniques),  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="168042" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; progression slowed significantly. The authors suggest taurine supplements could potentially worsen outcomes in people with leukaemia and propose that developing targeted ways to block taurine uptake by cancer cells might offer a new treatment strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Taurine: friend or foe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taurine is one of the most abundant free amino acids in the human body, found in especially high concentrations in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8400259/"&gt;heart, muscles and brain&lt;/a&gt;. In healthy people, it's &lt;a href="https://aspenjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1177/0148607190014002183"&gt;mainly obtained through diet&lt;/a&gt;, but the body can also synthesise taurine from the amino acids &lt;a href="https://jn.nutrition.org/article/S0022-3166(22)02429-4/pdf"&gt;methionine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275665776_L-Cysteine_metabolism_and_its_nutritional_implications"&gt;cysteine&lt;/a&gt;, provided it has enough &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB6-HealthProfessional/"&gt;vitamin B6&lt;/a&gt;, which is found in foods such as salmon, tuna, chicken, bananas and milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people consuming a typical &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10574552/"&gt;western diet take in 40mg–400mg of taurine&lt;/a&gt; a day from food alone. This figure refers only to taurine that is directly ingested, not including the additional amount the body can synthesise internally, which may vary depending on age, diet and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taurine is listed on the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Taurine#section=FDA-Generally-Recognized-as-Safe---GRAS-Notices"&gt;generally recognised as safe (GRAS) database&lt;/a&gt;, and according to the &lt;a href="https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2012.2815"&gt;European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)&lt;/a&gt;, it's safe to consume up to six grams per day. By comparison, a serving of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5215981/"&gt;Red Bull or Monster&lt;/a&gt; contains around one gram – comfortably below that threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite recent concerns about a possible link to blood cancer progression, taurine isn't inherently harmful. In fact, some people may benefit from supplementation, especially those receiving long-term &lt;a href="https://www.uhsussex.nhs.uk/resources/understanding-parenteral-nutrition/"&gt;parenteral nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, where nutrients are delivered directly into the bloodstream because the gut isn't working properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://www.biomolther.org/journal/view.html?uid=948&amp;amp;vmd=Full&amp;amp;"&gt;chronic liver, kidney or heart failure&lt;/a&gt; may also have trouble producing or holding on to enough taurine, making supplementation helpful in specific clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, some research suggests taurine may actually &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/cancerjournal/fulltext/2015/11020/effect_of_taurine_on_attenuating.35.aspx"&gt;help reduce the side effects of chemotherapy in leukaemia patients&lt;/a&gt; – even as emerging studies raise concerns that it could also fuel the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This contradiction underscores how much context matters: the effects of taurine depend not just on dosage and delivery, but also on the patient's underlying condition. What helps in one context, could harm in another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here's the catch: taking taurine as a supplement for particular health reasons is very different from consuming large quantities through energy drinks, which &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bdr2.1177"&gt;often combine&lt;/a&gt; taurine with high levels of caffeine and sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This combination can put strain on the heart, interfere with sleep and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10535526/"&gt;increase the risk of side effects&lt;/a&gt;, particularly for people with underlying health conditions or those taking other stimulants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest research raises important questions about whether taurine-heavy products could be harmful in some cases, especially for people with, or at risk of, blood cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So, should you worry?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/energy-drinks-evidence-brief/"&gt;According to the current evidence&lt;/a&gt;, if you're a healthy adult who occasionally sips an energy drink, there's little cause for alarm. But moderation is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consuming multiple high-taurine drinks daily or taking taurine supplements (without prior professional consultation), on top of a taurine-rich diet might not be wise, especially if future research confirms links between taurine and cancer progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until more is known, the safest approach would be to enjoy your energy boosts by consuming a nutritious diet &lt;a href="https://www.bda.uk.com/resource/energy-drinks-and-young-people.html"&gt;rather than consuming energy drinks&lt;/a&gt;. If you have any underlying health conditions – or a family history of cancer – it's always best to consult a healthcare professional before diving into taurine supplementation or consumption of energy drinks.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256957/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📊 &lt;strong&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/strong&gt; completed the largest whole-body imaging project, scanning 100,000 volunteers over 15 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🧠 The project provides an unprecedented dataset for advancing disease research, diagnostics, and treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💡 Researchers are leveraging the data to develop AI models for early disease detection and understanding organ aging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔬 Over 1,300 scientific papers have been published, showcasing the transformative impact of this &lt;strong&gt;comprehensive dataset&lt;/strong&gt; on medical science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Biobank has achieved a monumental breakthrough in medical imaging, completing the world’s largest whole-body imaging project. This endeavor, stretching over 15 years, saw the participation of 100,000 volunteers, who contributed immensely to advancing disease research and diagnostics. By scanning brains, hearts, abdomens, blood vessels, bones, and joints, UK Biobank has provided researchers with an unprecedented dataset. This accomplishment is not just about numbers; it represents a significant leap forward in understanding human health, influencing prevention methods, and enhancing treatment options worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Detailed Look Inside the Human Body&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen years ago, a cohort of 100,000 dedicated volunteers embarked on an ambitious journey with the UK Biobank, contributing to what would become the largest imaging project of its kind. Among them, Alison, a member of the Participant Advisory Group, emphasized the importance of this initiative, stating her motivation was to &lt;i&gt;“create a healthier future for all of us to enjoy.”&lt;/i&gt; These volunteers provided critical data, including lifestyle information and blood samples, which paved the way for groundbreaking research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project, backed by a substantial £60 million investment, involved extensive imaging sessions. Each volunteer underwent five-hour imaging appointments, where researchers collected 12,000 Magnetic Resonance (MR) images of vital organs such as the brain, heart, and abdomen. Additionally, ultrasounds of carotid arteries and comprehensive body scans were conducted, measuring bone density and body fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="3dJWyw35s9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/were-redefining-urban-mobility-envos-utility-personal-transporter-unleashed-as-the-future-of-compact-electric-vehicles/"&gt;“We’re Redefining Urban Mobility”: Envo’s Utility Personal Transporter Unleashed as the Future of Compact Electric Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imaging data has equipped scientists with the tools to explore diseases in unprecedented detail. According to Professor Louise Thomas, &lt;i&gt;“researchers can measure the size, shape, and composition of nearly every organ and tissue in the body in seconds, rather than hours per person.”&lt;/i&gt; This capability marks a significant advancement in the realm of medical research, offering insights previously unattainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Bright Future for Disease Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Biobank’s imaging data is already catalyzing significant discoveries in disease research. Scientists are leveraging this vast dataset to develop advanced AI models, such as one for a healthy heart, which aims to detect diseases early. Notably, researchers are beginning to grasp the concept that our organs might age biologically at a different rate than we do. This understanding is reshaping how we perceive age-related diseases and their onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kFAML4AF8u"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/were-about-to-break-the-ocean-speed-limit-revolutionary-kite-powered-sailboat-closes-in-on-historic-world-record/"&gt;“We’re About to Break the Ocean Speed Limit”: Revolutionary Kite-Powered Sailboat Closes In on Historic World Record&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the remarkable findings from this dataset is the intricate connection between the heart and brain. Such revelations are possible due to the immense scale of data being integrated into machine learning platforms, allowing for disease prediction years before symptoms manifest. Professor Paul Matthews highlighted the potential of this data, remarking on a study that used brain imaging from 20,000 participants to develop an AI tool capable of predicting the onset of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. &lt;i&gt;“The beauty of UK Biobank is the breadth of the data collected… the imaging scans add another layer of exquisite detail,”&lt;/i&gt; he noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unprecedented Scale and Impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Biobank’s imaging project is remarkable not just for its scale but also for its profound impact on the scientific community. Described as more than ten times larger than any prior studies, this project offers researchers the ability to discern disease patterns previously invisible. By providing a panoramic view of the human body, the data allows for a holistic understanding of how various aspects of our lives, from lifestyle choices to genetic predispositions, influence our health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="m7mJIol9S7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/i-built-it-to-break-the-rules-mit-students-pocket-sized-3d-printer-creates-complex-objects-in-just-seconds/"&gt;“I Built It to Break the Rules”: MIT Student’s Pocket-Sized 3D Printer Creates Complex Objects in Just Seconds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over 1,300 peer-reviewed scientific papers already published based on this data, the UK Biobank has set a new standard for medical research. The rapid analysis of heart scans in under a second is just one example of the technological advancements made possible by this dataset. The ability to see inside the human body &lt;i&gt;“in ways that were previously impossible”&lt;/i&gt; opens new avenues for research, enabling scientists to make connections that can lead to new diagnostics and therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Role of Volunteers and Continuous Advancements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central to the success of the UK Biobank’s imaging project is the role played by its volunteers. These individuals, driven by a desire to contribute to a healthier future, have collectively enabled a dataset of immense value to be compiled. Their commitment has not only enhanced our understanding of disease progression but also provided a foundation for future breakthroughs in medical science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the dataset continues to grow, so too does its potential to transform healthcare. The integration of lifestyle and health data with imaging results creates a comprehensive picture that can inform personalized medicine approaches. The ongoing contributions from these volunteers ensure that the UK Biobank remains a pivotal resource in the quest to unravel the complexities of human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Biobank’s imaging project signifies a monumental stride in medical research, offering insights that promise to revolutionize disease prevention and treatment. As we continue to explore the depths of this dataset, one must wonder: how will these insights shape the future of global healthcare, and what new frontiers will we uncover next?&lt;/p&gt;

The report noted that peanut butter is an “energy dense” food: Ounce for ounce, it has a lot more dietary fat and calories compared with eggs, Greek yogurt, lean meats, chicken breast, beans, fish and other high-protein foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RHASUYW6CJAMPKFTSOMWTRJTYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Peanut butter is certainly nutritious. It contains &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/14/high-fiber-meal-plan/" target="_blank"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, vitamins, minerals and heart-healthy unsaturated fats. But it contains at least twice as many grams of fat as protein. You should consider it a great source of fat, rather than a great source of protein, said Jose Antonio, an author of the report and a professor of health and human performance at Nova Southeastern University in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VME3BIY6YFC25IYWPNMQEPYGDM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If you read the nutrition label on any jar of peanut butter, you will see that it’s mostly fat,” said Antonio, who is also the chief executive of the International Society of Sports Nutrition. “The fat is good for you.

Otherwise, the authors warned, they may be setting themselves up for “unintentional weight gain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TC334XRZABHF3CC7P3T2KLA4HQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Peanut butter is a healthy food, but calories still matter,” Antonio said. “If you want to gain weight, eat a bunch of peanut butter.

It is also used off-label to treat other health issues, including low back pain. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Past studies have also found that using gabapentin may increase a person’s risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study reports that people who receive six or more prescriptions of gabapentin for lower back pain are at a higher risk of developing dementia and mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists found these risks were more than doubled in adults between the ages of 35 to 49 years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like all medications, gabapentin has some potential side effects, including dizziness, tiredness, water retention, and dry mouth.

They also categorized study participants into different age groups: 18–64, 18–34, 35–49, 50–64, and 65 or older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Currently, there is a discrepancy on whether taking gabapentin increases a patient’s risk for developing dementia,” &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vMyxOfQAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Nafis B. Eghrari&lt;/a&gt;, a 4th-year medical student at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, OH, and first author of this study, told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, there lacks a strong understanding of how gabapentin impacts cognitive function and whether it contributes to neurodegenerative processes. Previous studies have shown mixed findings on this topic. Thus, we decided to explore this gap in the field,” explained Eghrari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon analysis, researchers found that study participants who received six or more gabapentin prescriptions had a 29% higher risk of developing dementia, and an 85% greater chance of being diagnosed with MCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The significance of this finding is an association between gabapentin prescription and dementia on a nationwide level,” Eghrari explained. “Though this does not imply causation, this warrants further investigation on the drug’s long-term effects.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In terms of clinical significance, I recommend that physicians prescribing gabapentin for chronic pain perform cognitive exams on a regular basis when seeing patients,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d also advise patients who are taking this drug to alert their physician if they notice any cognitive deficits, including confusion, poor memory, or slowed thinking,” said the researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eghrari and his team also discovered that when looking at participants by age groups, the risks for dementia more than doubled and more than tripled for MCI in people who were 35 to 49 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find this relatively higher risk in the non-elderly population,” Eghrari said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results indicate that gabapentin may have a greater cognitive impact on non-elderly individuals, as elderly individuals are already at risk for neurodegeneration due to their older age. This finding warrants further investigation into the underlying mechanism of how gabapentin may impact cognition.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Nafis B. Eghrari&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key takeaway of this study is that patients prescribed gabapentin for chronic back pain should be closely monitored by their physician for cognitive decline,” he continued. “Moreover, gabapentin should be prescribed with caution due to the associated risk of dementia/cognitive impairment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope to carry this research forward and explore whether there is a true causative relationship between gabapentin and cognitive impairment,” Eghrari added. “We also plan to investigate the underlying mechanisms of how the drug may impact cognition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT &lt;/em&gt;had the opportunity to speak with &lt;a href="https://infospine.net/meet-dr-anand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Neel Anand&lt;/a&gt;, MD, MCh Orth, a board-certified orthopedic spine surgeon and director of the Cedars-Sinai Spine Center in Los Angeles, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anand, who was not involved in the research, commented that there are pros and cons to studies with big data sets as there are many variables and it is hard to determine the true causative factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, little or no information was provided on any other illnesses participants may have had or other medications they were taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The best thing I would take from the study is […] [that] there’s not a single drug without a side effect — they all have some issues,” Anand pointed out. “So the answer is, if you’re chronically going to take something, you better watch out — something’s [potentially] going to go wrong somewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anand said the best way to prove anything is to take a cohort of study participants who take a specific medication and nothing else, and compare them to another cohort who does not take the medication. And researchers need to ensure that participants take the medication if it is prescribed to them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that, in some cases, patients do not follow the doctor’s indications regarding prescription medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes they do more, sometimes they’ll take less,“ Anand said. “The only way to actually study [the real-life effects of long-term drug use] would be to literally take a thousand people and give them gabapentin and nothing else, and a thousand you don’t, and then follow them over 5 years or more,” he suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he admitted that “at least we can be cognizant“ that there may be a heightened risk of dementia with prolonged gabapentin use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is “a possibility that [doctors] needs to be aware [of] or at least counsel our patients [on] — that’s fair,” Anand added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 10:20:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQaG5DYUV0cU1qREE2YnZnMXRmYTFkZnl0ZUNVeGxWVGtTUTZQclAzRTZPQWhUNWdJWkNxMGxOX2t5a1B1UThjU3d4bU5heWxJMUNXUHgtRmptN25OdVVJeGotN0pTZjJEWU1GRk1fUkdaY3o4TzZtLWRBdUJkVk1VWkhidk1xeGEzcUZneEo5SGVWRjF0QmxNLU9ObXE3T2Z1cGxtV25HeW5pUQ</guid></item><item><title>即使是健康的大脑也会随着年龄的增长而衰退。以下是您可以做的事情-美国国家公共广播电台 | Even healthy brains decline with age.

                Even healthy brains slow down as they age. But there are ways to keep that thinker in tip-top shape.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;After about age 40, our brains begin to lose a step or two.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Each year, our reaction time slows by a few thousandths of a second. We're also less able to recall items on a shopping list.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those changes can be signs of a disease, like Alzheimer's. But usually, they're not.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Both of those things, memory and processing speed, change with age in a normal group of people," says &lt;a href="https://www.tgen.org/faculty-profiles/matt-huentelman/" target="_blank"&gt;Matt Huentelman&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at TGen, the Translational Genomics Research Institute, in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Huentelman should know. He helps run &lt;a href="https://mindcrowd.org/" target="_blank"&gt;MindCrowd&lt;/a&gt;, a free online cognitive test that has been taken by more than 700,000 adults.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;About a thousand of those people had test scores indicating that their brain was "exceptional," meaning they performed like a person 30 years younger on tests of memory and processing speed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Genetics played a role, of course. But Huentelman and a team of researchers have been focusing on other differences.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"We want to study these exceptional performers because we think they can tell us what the rest of us should be doing," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Early results suggest that sleep and maintaining cardiovascular health are a good start. Other &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;measures&lt;/a&gt; include avoiding smoking, limiting alcohol and getting plenty of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huentelman was one of several dozen researchers who met in Miami this summer to discuss healthy brain aging. The event was hosted by the &lt;a href="https://mcknightbrain.org/" target="_blank"&gt;McKnight Brain Research Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, which funds studies on age-related cognitive decline and memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To preserve cognitive function in later life, "we're going to have to understand [brain] aging at a mechanistic level," says &lt;a href="https://mcknightbrain.org/the-mcknight-brain-research-foundation-announces-alice-luo-clayton-phd-as-chief-executive-officer/" target="_blank"&gt;Alice Luo Clayton&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist who is the group's chief executive officer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Another speaker was &lt;a href="https://mbi-umiami.org/lab-member/christian-agudelo-md/" target="_blank"&gt;Christian Agudelo&lt;/a&gt;, a sleep neurologist at the University of Miami's Evelyn F. McKnight Brain Institute.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think the value of sleep and sleep deprivation became true to me when I had kids," Agudelo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those kids are 4 and 6 now, so Agudelo is getting more sleep. But his own experience is consistent with his &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12250" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on the relationship between sleep and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"The better you sleep, the better your brain health is going to be both structurally and functionally," Agudelo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind: Better sleep isn't just about getting more sleep.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The key is getting high-quality sleep, which allows the brain to cycle through all the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526132/" target="_blank"&gt;sleep stages&lt;/a&gt;, Agudelo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers can measure how well a person is sleeping by monitoring their brain wave patterns. But people usually know when they've had a good night's rest, Agudelo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You go to sleep, you wake up and you feel like that experience was worthwhile," he says. "You feel refreshed."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Ensuring high-quality sleep is tricky. But people can improve the odds with certain behaviors, Agudelo says&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Waking up at the same time every single day and aligning our sleep rhythms with the rhythm of the sun" can lead to better sleep, he says. So can "being active, both socially and physically."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those behaviors increase "sleep pressure," the body's natural desire to sleep the longer we are awake, Agudelo says. When that pressure is high, he says, "we can fall asleep more easily and deeply."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Brain aging is also influenced by vascular risk factors, like blood pressure, cholesterol levels and diabetes, says &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/medical-center/team/639/charles-decarli---neurology---dementia---alzheimer-s-disease-sacramento/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles DeCarli&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist who co-directs the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the University of California, Davis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People know that these risk factors usually contribute to medical conditions like heart attack or stroke, DeCarli says. But &lt;a href="https://diversevcid.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on thousands of people 65 and older has found that these risk factors can also impact the brain directly — even if they don't cause a heart attack or other cardiovascular problems.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The size of the brain, the shape of the brain, the tissue integrity of the brain looks older in people who have these risk factors than in people who do not have them," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So DeCarli and a team of researchers are studying whether it's possible to protect the brain by aggressively treating conditions that affect the circulatory system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The question is, if you have these diseases and they are well controlled, will you have a younger-looking brain?" he says. "And the answer seems to be yes."&lt;/p&gt;

The factors include not smoking, a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/03/health/mediterranean-diet-shopping-list-printable-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nutritious diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nutritious diet&lt;/a&gt;, regular exercise, a healthy weight, optimal blood pressure, controlled blood sugar and well-managed cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers reviewed 483 studies on the impacts of maximizing Life’s Simple 7 on the health of many different body systems over the course of people’s lives in a meta-analysis published Wednesday in the &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.038566" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of the American Heart Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining ideal levels of at least three of Life’s Simple 7 metrics was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, even if someone had a genetic predisposition, according to the data. And better scores across all of the factors showed benefits in many body systems beyond cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A few years ago, we learned that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/10/health/heart-dementia-risk-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart health and brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart health and brain health&lt;/a&gt; are very closely tied. Through this review, we found that almost every organ system and bodily function also benefits from maintaining the healthy lifestyle behaviors of Life’s Simple 7,” said lead study author Dr. Liliana Aguayo, a research assistant professor at the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing and the Global Diabetes Research Center at Emory University in Atlanta, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were pleasantly surprised to find that Life’s Simple 7 at optimal levels touched every aspect of health, from head to toe. It goes well beyond just cardiovascular health to encompass whole-body health,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Eating plant-based foods can help heart health, said Dr. Nour Makarem of Columbia University. - FG Trade/E+/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It doesn’t take much to see the benefit&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted a systemic review of studies that followed a gold standard approach, said Dr. Nour Makarem, assistant professor of epidemiology and co-leader of the Chronic Disease Unit at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health in New York City. Makarem was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant findings of the research is that a little change makes a big difference when it comes to lifestyle and health, Aguayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study assessed adherence to Life’s Simple 7 using a scale from 0 to 14 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each improvement by 1 point was associated with an 11% decrease in dementia risk, a 6% decreased risk of eye disease, a 23% decreased risk of fatty liver disease, and an 11% decreased risk of chronic kidney disease, Aguayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This means that small changes, for example, moving from obesity to overweight, adding any physical activity even if below recommended levels counted as progress,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the studies showed an adherence to Life’s Simple 7 was associated with maintaining brain and lung function, vision and hearing, and teeth and muscle strength over the course of aging, according to the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The essential 8 steps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies included in the meta-analysis used Life’s Simple 7 to evaluate lifestyle behaviors, but the AHA has since updated the metrics to Life’s Essential 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines are more comprehensive, such as including avoiding secondhand smoke, vaping and nicotine products in the not smoking factor and pointing people to the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/25/health/mediterranean-diet-cancer-prevention-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/27/health/best-diets-heart-aha-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DASH diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt; under the healthy eating metric, Makarem said. DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension; high blood pressure is a major contributor to heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the update added an eighth metric that recognizes the role of sleep in long-term health, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good sleep means seven to nine hours a night for most adults, 10 to 16 hours for children ages 5 and younger, 9 to 12 hours for kids ages 6 to 12, and 8 to 10 hours for adolescents ages 13 to 18, according to the AHA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study confirms that adopting a healthy lifestyle is important to achieve optimal health as well as managing the conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease –– weight, blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar, Aguayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Even adding a little bit of exercise can help. - Oleg Breslavtsev/Moment RF/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Small changes make a big difference&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyday lifestyle choices have a big impact on overall health, and it’s worth it to take steps toward better cardiovascular health, Aguayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key message is that it is never too early or too late to make small, feasible changes,” she said in an email. “Small improvements in diet, physical activity, smoking, or managing risk factors (weight, blood pressure, cholesterol and sugar) can have meaningful benefits, not just for heart health, but for all the body, from head to toe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a heart-healthy diet, Makarem recommends focusing on plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains and consuming lean proteins such as fish. She also recommended limiting processed foods, sodium and sugar-sweetened beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults should engage in 150 minutes of moderate physical activity — like walking, dancing or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/home/the-best-garden-tools?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gardening;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;gardening&lt;/a&gt; — or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity a week, Makarem added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even considering how impactful small changes can be, ideal cardiovascular health is very rare –– with less than 4% of people worldwide meeting the criteria, Aguayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We must do more to support young people, especially women, by making it easier, more affordable, and achievable for all to improve their cardiovascular health,” she added. “Cardiovascular disease is still the number one killer of women. Supporting the heart health of young people and women is both cost-effective and the right thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sign up for &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/newsletters/fitness-life-but-better?source=nl-acq_article" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series&lt;/a&gt;.

You’ve probably seen erythritol listed on sodas, protein bars, and even toothpaste. It’s everywhere. Almost zero calories, no sugar spikes, and perfect for keto diets. Sounds like a win, but maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from the &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Colorado Boulder&lt;/a&gt; has cracked open a side of erythritol that few expected. It’s not about weight gain or tooth decay. It’s about what this &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/artificial-sweeteners-erythritol-directly-linked-to-heart-attacks-and-strokes/"&gt;sweetener&lt;/a&gt; does to your brain’s blood vessels that may elevate the risk of a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study adds to the evidence suggesting that non-nutritive sweeteners that have generally been purported to be safe, may not come without negative health consequences,” said Professor Christopher DeSouza, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-artificial-sweeteners"&gt;Understanding artificial sweeteners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners like erythritol have become go-to sugar substitutes for people looking to cut calories or manage blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/erythritol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Erythritol&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, is a sugar alcohol found naturally in some fruits but is typically produced in bulk from corn or wheat starch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It tastes sweet like sugar but has almost zero calories and doesn’t spike blood glucose, making it popular among those with diabetes or on keto diets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike some other sugar alcohols, erythritol usually causes fewer digestive issues because your body absorbs most of it before it reaches the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s not without controversy. Some recent studies, including this one, have raised concerns about potential links between high erythritol levels and cardiovascular issues like heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sweetener-changes-brain-cells"&gt;Sweetener changes brain cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers did not yet test this in people. They went straight to the cells that line your brain’s blood vessels. These cells regulate blood flow, keep inflammation in check, and help prevent clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cells were exposed to erythritol for just three hours. The amount used was equal to what you would get from one sugar-free drink. That was all it took to cause noticeable changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cells got stressed. They flooded with free radicals, also called reactive oxygen species or ROS. These unstable molecules damage proteins, DNA, and cell membranes. In response, antioxidant defenses went up, but not enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was like the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/artificial-sweetener-erythritol-sugar-substitute-linked-to-blood-clots-heart-disease/"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; knew they were under attack and tried, unsuccessfully, to defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-vessels-started-misbehaving"&gt;Blood vessels started misbehaving&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same short exposure changed how the cells produced nitric oxide, a molecule that helps blood vessels relax. Less nitric oxide means tighter vessels. That’s bad news when your brain needs steady blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total amount of the enzyme that makes nitric oxide didn’t change much, but its function tanked. It stopped doing its job well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol messed with the enzyme’s activation at two specific sites. One turned down, one cranked up. The result was about 20 percent less nitric oxide production. This sets the stage for constricted &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/nutritionists-reveal-the-surprising-health-benefits-of-maple-syrup-including-less-belly-fat/"&gt;vessels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sweetener-makes-brain-vessels-tighten"&gt;Sweetener makes brain vessels tighten&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same cells started pumping out more &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23139-endothelin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;endothelin-1&lt;/a&gt;, a protein that tells blood vessels to tighten up. Compared to normal cells, the erythritol-exposed ones had a 30 percent increase in ET-1. They also had more of its precursor, Big ET-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a double whammy. First, blood vessels lose their ability to widen. Then, they get signals to squeeze even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Big picture, if your vessels are more constricted and your ability to break down blood clots is lowered, your risk of stroke goes up,” said first author Auburn Berry. “Our research demonstrates not only that, but how erythritol has the potential to increase stroke risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clots-don-t-stand-a-chance"&gt;Clots don’t stand a chance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood clots are tricky. You want your body to stop bleeding when you get a cut. But you also want it to break down unnecessary clots inside vessels. One of the body’s tools for that is tissue-type plasminogen activator, or t-PA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers added thrombin, which mimics a clotting &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-sweetener-can-destroy-some-of-the-most-dangerous-bacteria/"&gt;signal&lt;/a&gt;. Normally, that should have made the cells release more t-PA. In untreated cells, that’s exactly what happened. A nice 25 percent boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In erythritol-treated cells? Nothing. The response was completely muted. Clots form and cells don’t react. That’s the formula for a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study tracked over 4,000 people in the U.S. and Europe. The research team found that those with high blood levels of erythritol had more strokes and heart attacks within three years. This happened across both sexes and regardless of other health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Colorado team didn’t just observe changes. They showed exactly how the sweetener weakens brain vessel cells in ways that match the stroke patterns found in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sweeteners-may-harm-blood-vessels"&gt;Sweeteners may harm blood vessels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeSouza and his team exposed real human brain vessel cells to a typical drink-size dose of erythritol. Many people consume several such servings a day. And unlike some substances, erythritol crosses into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study wasn’t designed to track long-term effects, but it does raise a concern. What happens when those cells face erythritol not just for three hours, but every day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the epidemiological study that inspired our work, and now our cellular findings, we believe it would be prudent for people to monitor their consumption of non-nutrient-sweeteners such as this one,” said DeSouza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 09:26:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE53dzc4LXUwSmlGalJMa0Z0MnE2LUU1aFJCZEIyUXJfMklUQnQ0NWF5bFBlVUdEMDJsTlMxaHdacjhDYjI2VjZYdlFYVDdNZk84TmpxN3VjT3EyRkJsaUhxLVRVY05BZjEySGVsQkxESmZKa1hoQTdneTUwRmp0RUU</guid></item><item><title>肿瘤学家需要将抗菌素耐药性视为癌症护理提供危机- STAT | Oncologists need to see antimicrobial resistance as a cancer care delivery crisis - STAT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxObm91X0hTTFJ5OUFZT0R2QldlTlBYdC16Qy1FY21nVm5WWXdEOGxEVjBGMTNtT3JHM0d0SUlZVUV4QmtIZGZOVFJrYm1IZW1iLUM0bldfTDhMdjlMX3RwSEVoeElLcV9MOWFhSmQxbHVUeG51TE15aGw3aFpIeWRjaFFoN2dGUWxkbGhJUmpiX0tOMkROc0hEbnp1MXk2bGNicVFfVVJZTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a medical oncologist, one of the first threats I inform new patients about during the informed consent process for cancer treatment is how vulnerable they now are to infections. Cancer weakens the immune system, and common therapies on which we rely, such as chemotherapy, further diminish the body’s ability to protect itself from infections. An upper respiratory infection might be an inconvenience for a healthy adult. For an immunocompromised person living with cancer, it could be fatal. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t understand how important antibiotics are to cancer care. My entire ability to treat a patient’s cancer is predicated on the idea that antibiotics will both cure and prevent opportunistic bacterial infections throughout their course of care. It is no exaggeration when I say that antibiotics have helped nearly every cancer patient whom I have successfully cared for during their hospital admission for complications of their cancer or treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And yet, when I was invited to be part of a joint task force and research team focused on antimicrobial resistance among cancer patients, I hesitated. My first thought was, “That’s not a cancer specialist’s problem, that’s an infectious disease problem.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Antibiotic-resistant bacteria, colloquially known as “superbugs,” are a fast-emerging global threat that are now associated with more than &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)00876-6/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;4.5 million deaths annually&lt;/a&gt;. They cause complex infections that cannot be treated with standard antibiotics, and they are more common in immunocompromised patients. Antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest threats to modern medicine, but there’s very little discussion so far of what it means for cancer care. Part of the problem is that in the hyper-specialized worlds of medicine and health policy, superbugs are the remit of infectious disease specialists while cancer occupies the realm of non-communicable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After reflecting on how dependent my patients are on antibiotics, I stepped out of my silo and joined the research team. What we have found is alarming and should serve as a wake-up call to oncologists everywhere to join the global fight against antimicrobial resistance.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Our first study, published in &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39673173/__;!!BspMT6SJLSDJ!LlL5ZS4mJdElE7G7rOX85Tf-_aMHQc7aJCIG2N7mlSRJs3QsJHbTSdo146aWJy3eIQBUNc4Nybkq4U90Ai14zEakD2k8oVQ3bbOsw6M%24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cancer Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, examined data from more than 4 million admissions across 168 hospitals in the U.S. and found that hospitalized cancer patients were 1.5 to 2 times more likely to have an antibiotic-resistant infection compared with hospitalized patients who did not have cancer. Several of the drug-resistant bacteria for which cancer patients were at increased risk, according to our study, have been flagged by the World Health Organization as “priority pathogens,” meaning they pose a notable threat to global public health, and there are few new drugs in development against them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In our second study, recently published in &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(25)00128-7/fulltext__;!!BspMT6SJLSDJ!LlL5ZS4mJdElE7G7rOX85Tf-_aMHQc7aJCIG2N7mlSRJs3QsJHbTSdo146aWJy3eIQBUNc4Nybkq4U90Ai14zEakD2k8oVQ3fUJ8ODU%24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lancet Oncology&lt;/a&gt;, we observed a similar elevated risk in the outpatient setting. In our analysis of more than 1.5 million bacterial isolates collected from 198 outpatient facilities in the U.S., we found that rates for antimicrobial resistance among priority pathogens were up to 3 times higher in cancer patients compared with non-cancer patients who received care in the outpatient setting; for the multidrug-resistant bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the rate was five times greater among patients with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also of concern is that our data showed that cancer patients had significantly higher rates of infections caused by bacteria that were resistant to a class of antibiotics known as fluoroquinolones. That’s troubling, as the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend prophylactically administering fluoroquinolones when patients have an elevated risk of developing neutropenia, a complication that results in reduced numbers of specific white blood cells, and is a relatively common side effect associated with chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Superbugs and cancer are both global challenges that disproportionately affect those in low- and middle-income countries, and the dangerous synergies our studies identified between cancer and antibiotic resistance are likely amplified many times over in countries with fewer resources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are basic precautions we can take to mitigate the threat. Clinicians, patients, and their families need to adhere to infection control and prevention guidelines, as well as recommended immunization guidelines. Handwashing, disinfecting shared surfaces, and vigilantly monitoring for symptoms of an infection are some of the best ways to protect vulnerable patients from infections.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Governments and drugmakers also need to work toward revitalizing research and development into new antibiotics and faster, more precise diagnostics for bacterial infections. There are approximately &lt;a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/330420/9789240000193-eng.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;50 new antibiotic candidates&lt;/a&gt; in clinical development compared with more than &lt;a href="https://www.iqvia.com/insights/the-iqvia-institute/reports-and-publications/reports/global-oncology-trends-2024#:~:text=More%20than%202%2C000%20new%20oncology,multispecific%20antibodies%2C%20and%20radioligand%20therapies." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;1,500 cancer treatments&lt;/a&gt; and vaccine candidates in development. Without effective antibiotics, we’ll never fully reap the benefits of immunotherapies, precision medicines, and other recent advances in cancer care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On a more fundamental level, cancer providers need to speak up and spotlight the threat antibiotic-resistant infections pose to our patients. Treatment guidelines pertaining to antibiotic-resistant infections among cancer patients continue to lag. The most recent American Society of Clinical Oncology and Infectious Diseases Society of America Clinical Practice Guideline Update for management of neutropenic fever in adult cancer patients was in &lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2017.77.6211" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;. Very few cancer societies address, let alone prioritize, antibiotic resistance as a global public health crisis to promote with their members. And there is scant published research on antibiotic resistance and its current and long-term implications for cancer care; the research that does exist tends to be in infectious disease journals, not oncology journals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A cancer patient and an infectious disease patient are often the same person, and our siloed systems artificially bifurcate how clinicians approach each ailment. A holistic approach to the care of our patients requires that we equally advocate for newer cancer therapies at the same time as we join the fight against antimicrobial resistance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We urgently need to build an evidence base that can better inform how we care for our patients in the age of superbugs, and we need to draw on experts from across disciplines to develop strategies for educating patients on this emerging risk. In other words, we need to step out of our silos.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether you’re delivering boxes of non-perishables to the food bank or participating in your local blood drive, it feels great to give back to the community. Sometimes, you can even get paid for your contributions. But the check should be a bonus, rather than your sole motivation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One woman who works at a plasma donation center recently &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1lz7da2/you_are_not_entitled_to_payment_we_are_not_a_bank/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;posted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a story on Reddit about one of the most &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/society/social-issues/entitled-people/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;&lt;span&gt;entitled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;characters she’s encountered at work.

According to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/givingequalsliving/giveplasma/why-give" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, 130 plasma donations will treat someone with primary immunodeficiency for an entire year. And 1,200 donations will take care of an individual with hemophilia for a year. Plasma is also used for tetanus and rabies treatment, and pregnant women with Rh sensitization rely on it as well. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So who exactly is eligible to donate plasma? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.plasmasource.org/who-it-s-for/eligibility" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;PlasmaSource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; notes on their site that donors must be between 18 and 69 years old and weigh at least 110 pounds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;They must be in good physical health and test negative for any transmissible infectious diseases. It’s also crucial  that they disclose all of their current medical conditions and share any medications they’re currently taking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_3" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Donors must then complete a health screening and physical exam to check their blood pressure, pulse, temperature, protein levels and ensure they don’t have anemia. If a donor has recently given birth, they must be at least six months postpartum, and all donors must avoid taking aspirin for at least 48 hours prior to giving plasma. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the morning that someone plans to donate plasma, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/qualifications-for-plasma-donation-and-what-to-expect-when-donating" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;WebMD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; recommends having a healthy breakfast and drinking lots of liquids but avoiding coffee, tea and alcohol. It’s best to avoid oily and greasy foods too, as these can impact the quality of a person’s plasma.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As for what donors can expect during the process, WebMD says the entire appointment should take approximately 90 minutes. This time will include registration, screening and the donation, which typically lasts for about 25 minutes. Afterwards, donors should have a snack and drink plenty of fluids, then take it easy for the rest of the day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s also important to note that, in the United States, plasma can only be used after a donor gives &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/givingequalsliving/giveplasma/giving-process" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;at least twice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. So donors must return to the same center within 6 months after their first donation to ensure that their plasma is safe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="getty-images-AtTM7SEiAQU-unsplash" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/entitled-woman-plasma-donation/?image_id=getty-images-AtTM7SEiAQU-unsplash.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="You\'re Not Entitled To Payment.

And they help hundreds of thousands of people each year. But not everyone supports the idea of paying donors for their plasma, as this can get into murky ethical territory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2024/03/06/plasma-donations-financial-lifesaver-and-ethical-dilemma#:~:text=Pharmaceutical%20companies%20often%20pay%20around,a%20certain%20number%20of%20donations." target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;CU Boulder Today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; reports that donors are often paid $50 per donation but can sometimes be paid up to $200 during times of shortages. And advertisements sometimes boast that donors can receive $800 a month for giving plasma a few times.        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But Emily Gallagher, Assistant Professor of Finance at CU Boulder, argues that these donation centers sometimes prey on low-income individuals who are desperate for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/fastest-easiest-way-people-made-money/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;&lt;span&gt;extra cash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The more payday lenders and pawn shops that are in a local area, the more likely that a plasma center will soon open there,” Gallagher says. “It probably is the case that when plasma centers are analyzing where to open, the prevalence of these types of alternative lenders is a good signal of a market to enter.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She also worries about the health of those who donate frequently. “Nobody actually knows what the longer-term health costs of doing this twice per week might be,” Gallagher noted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So if you plan on donating plasma, it’s probably a good idea to do so out of the kindness of your heart, rather than because you have no other way to pay rent on time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_4" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We would love to hear your thoughts on this situation in the comments below, pandas.

			&lt;p&gt;A massive, 24-year-long study of more than 1.2 million children provides reassurance to parents around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has found &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; compelling evidence that childhood vaccines lead to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="167987" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;, asthma, or dozens of other chronic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Denmark examined the safety of a specific vaccine ingredient – aluminum salts – which, despite &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.663280"&gt;frequent debunking&lt;/a&gt;, remains a common talking point among vaccine skeptics. &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum"&gt;Clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; have tested their safety extensively, and they've been used in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/basics/explaining-how-vaccines-work.html"&gt;non-live vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for more than 70 years to boost the immune system's response to lower doses of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/is-there-thimerosal-in-vaccines-and-is-it-safe-heres-what-the-science-says?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Is There Thimerosal in Vaccines, And Is It Safe? Here's What The Science Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the salts contain aluminum ions, their chemical properties are quite different to those of pure aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really important for parents to understand that we are not injecting metal into children," epidemiologist and senior author Anders Hviid from Statens Serum Institute in Denmark &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/study-finds-no-link-aluminum-vaccines-autism-asthma-rcna218682"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; NBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study addresses many of these concerns and provides clear and robust evidence for the safety of childhood vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1997 through 2020, Hviid and colleagues tracked the health outcomes of more than 1.2 million Danish children using a nationwide registry containing details on childhood vaccinations, diagnoses, and potential biases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the children were born at a time when fewer vaccines with aluminum salts were recommended. Others grew up when more were recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, a kid's exposure to vaccine-related aluminum salts before age 2 was not significantly related to any of 50 chronic disorders, including 36 autoimmune, 9 allergic, and 5 neurodevelopmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of dose-dependent relationship between aluminum salts and a child's ongoing health strongly suggests the ingredient is safe for use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167990" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167990" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/images_annals2500997ff2_figure_2_early_childhood_vaccination_with_aluminum_adsorbed_vaccines_in-642x468.jpg" alt="Early Childhood Vaccines" class="size-medium wp-image-167990" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/images_annals2500997ff2_figure_2_early_childhood_vaccination_with_aluminum_adsorbed_vaccines_in-642x468.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/images_annals2500997ff2_figure_2_early_childhood_vaccination_with_aluminum_adsorbed_vaccines_in-569x415.jpg 569w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/images_annals2500997ff2_figure_2_early_childhood_vaccination_with_aluminum_adsorbed_vaccines_in-768x560.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/images_annals2500997ff2_figure_2_early_childhood_vaccination_with_aluminum_adsorbed_vaccines_in-600x437.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/images_annals2500997ff2_figure_2_early_childhood_vaccination_with_aluminum_adsorbed_vaccines_in.jpg 870w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167990" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Early childhood vaccination with aluminum-adsorbed vaccines in Denmark from 1997 through 2020.

Whether we realize it or not, the typical adult &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum"&gt;ingests&lt;/a&gt; about 7 to 9 milligrams of aluminum a day in various forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By some estimates, if infants receive all the vaccines they need in the first six months of life, that would amount to about 4.4 mg of aluminum. In that same time frame, breast-fed infants ingest about 7 mg of aluminum, and formula-fed infants ingest about 38 milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When aluminum adjuvants in vaccines are injected into muscle, they enter the bloodstream and are then &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/04/scicheck-posts-raise-unfounded-concerns-about-aluminum-in-vaccines/"&gt;processed&lt;/a&gt; by the kidneys and expelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2017.09.003"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 85 infants, aluminum concentrations in the blood and hair did not increase after receiving a vaccine. This suggests that aluminum concentrations in the body don't accumulate or reach toxic levels after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="167987" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/groups/global-advisory-committee-on-vaccine-safety/topics/adjuvants"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that the level of aluminum after vaccination "never exceeds safe US regulatory thresholds… even for low birth-weight infants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, there is strong evidence to suggest aluminum adjuvants are safe for use in childhood vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, each year, about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-immunization/fast-facts/index.html"&gt;four million deaths&lt;/a&gt; are avoided because of these immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood vaccinations don't threaten children's lives, they save them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The result? Poor focus, memory glitches, and emotional fatigue. I’ve developed five daily habits — used with patients and in my own life — that help restore clarity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen more frazzled, forgetful, foggy patients this year than ever before. Not because they’re sick. Not because they’re old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But because their brains are overstimulated and undernourished in ways we still don’t fully understand. “I forget words mid-sentence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My brain feels like a browser with 78 tabs open.” “Even when I rest, &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/tiny-signs-chronic-fatigue-system"&gt;I feel tired&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These aren’t rare comments. I hear them every day — like the mother of three who told me she forgot her ATM PIN at checkout, or the tech worker who confessed he hasn’t read a full email in months.  From executives. From teachers. From teenagers. This is a clinical reality, not just a vibe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;As a doctor, I’ve come to believe we’re living through a silent cognitive crisis, and that's why everyone's brains feel so broken right now. &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-07/why-everyones-brain-feels-so-broken-right-now.png" alt="woman who's brain feels broken" title="why everyone's brain feels so broken right now" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;CrizzyStudio / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not dementia. Not quite depression. Something subtler — and more pervasive. A kind of neural exhaustion from too many inputs, too few boundaries, and no clear &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/simple-steps-help-you-hit-reset-button-your-life-only-15-minutes"&gt;way to reset&lt;/a&gt;. The science is beginning to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;We’re starting to understand how constant stimulation physically reshapes the brain. We were never built for this.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what I see in the clinic every week: A lawyer tells me he’s making more mistakes in briefs than ever before. A college student describes &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/people-who-suddenly-lose-interest-everyone-around-them-often-have-these-reasons"&gt;losing interest in everything&lt;/a&gt;, even her favorite books. A nurse forgets common medication names during shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of them is sick. All of them are overwhelmed. And it’s not just mental. It’s physical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their nervous systems are stuck in a mild but constant state of fight-or-flight. Their pulse is up. Their sleep is down. And their minds can’t seem to slow down, even when their bodies try. We weren’t built for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/people-maintain-discipline-say-no-without-feeling-guilty-have-these-strengths"&gt;People Who Maintain The Discipline To Say No Without Feeling Guilty Have These 5 Strengths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your brain doesn't work in modern life. In medical terms, here’s what we think is happening: Brain scans now reveal that chronic overstimulation — including scrolling, alerts, newsfeeds, and multitasking — shrinks the prefrontal cortex, heightens stress pathways, and overwhelms the brain with noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortisol overdrive:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/subtle-ways-stress-completely-messes-up-your-life"&gt;Chronic stress&lt;/a&gt;, even mild, keeps the stress hormone cortisol elevated, leading to memory impairment and mood instability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Default Mode Network disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain’s Default Mode Network (DMN) — active during rest and introspection — supports creativity, memory, and self-awareness. But constant task-switching and alerts suppress DMN activity, preventing the brain from entering deeper states of reflection and consolidation. Harvard and UC studies suggest this disruption may reduce creative insight and cognitive resilience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine dysregulation:&lt;/strong&gt; Constant hits of novelty (social media, texts, headlines) mess with our motivation system. What used to feel rewarding — a walk, a conversation — feels dull by comparison.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/productive-people-avoid-these-things-like-plague"&gt;The Top 1% Of Productive People Avoid These 8 Things Like The Plague&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result: A pervasive sense that we’re always behind, always distracted, and never really resting. Here are the five strategies I recommend most often. Not supplements. Not brain games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Here are five simple, evidence-backed tools that help reset the brain and make it feel less broken:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Start your day with a light, not a screen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunlight (or a 10,000 lux lamp) within 30 minutes of waking boosts alertness, mood, and circadian rhythm regulation. Scrolling does the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Protect at least one “deep work” block&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even 45 minutes a day of uninterrupted focus, with no pings or multitasking, can &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-laser-focused-people-do-stay-on-task-finish-stuff"&gt;rebuild attention networks&lt;/a&gt; over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Reclaim boredom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let yourself do nothing — no phone, no podcast, no input — for 5–10 minutes a day. This reactivates the Default Mode Network (DMN), the brain’s system for creativity, memory, and self-reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DMN becomes active when you’re not focused on external tasks — during rest, daydreaming, or mind-wandering. Doing nothing — especially without digital stimulation — helps engage this network, supporting:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creativity&lt;/strong&gt; (idea generation, divergent thinking)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autobiographical memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future planning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem-solving&lt;/strong&gt; rooted in personal experience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/health-wellness/everyday-habits-can-damage-your-brain-according-research"&gt;11 Everyday Habits That Can Damage Your Brain, According To Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Use your eyes to calm the mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lateral eye movement — like looking side to side while walking outdoors or deliberately scanning the horizon — activates the parasympathetic system and reduces stress. Even 5 minutes of this, especially in nature, can lower heart rate and improve focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Schedule a daily digital reset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose a fixed time (even 20 minutes) when all devices go off. Treat it like a prescription. This single boundary can lower anxiety and help your brain transition from reaction to reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One patient — a 39-year-old software project manager — implemented all five of these habits over a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Day 4, her headaches stopped. By Day 6, she told me her memory had “snapped back.” By Day 7, she had read a book cover to cover for the first time in two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t magic. It’s neurology. A week of &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/plant-habits-now-enjoy-good-life-years-to-come"&gt;intentional habits&lt;/a&gt; can change how your brain feels and functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;If your brain feels broken lately, it’s not a personal failure — it’s a system failure. &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are living in a world designed to fracture our attention and monetize our exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you can push back. You can &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/ways-set-much-needed-boundary-without-saying-single-word"&gt;create boundaries&lt;/a&gt;. You can heal your focus.

          &lt;p&gt;A sweeping analysis of health data from more than 1.2 million children in Denmark born over a 24-year period found no link between the small amounts of aluminum in vaccines and a wide range of health conditions—including asthma, allergies, eczema, autism, and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finding, &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997"&gt;published in the Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, firmly squashes a persistent anti-vaccine talking point that can give vaccine-hesitant parents pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small amounts of aluminum salts have been added to vaccines for decades as adjuvants, that is, components of the vaccine that help drum up protective immune responses against a target germ. Aluminum adjuvants can be found in a variety of vaccines, including those against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, &lt;em&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/em&gt; type b (Hib), and hepatitis A and B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of use worldwide and no clear link to harms, concern about aluminum and cumulative exposures continually resurfaces—largely thanks to anti-vaccine advocates who fearmonger about the element. A leader of such voices is Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the current US health secretary and an ardent anti-vaccine advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/p6LJXPOv4SM?t=3885"&gt;a June 2024 interview with podcaster Joe Rogan&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy falsely claimed that aluminum is "extremely neurotoxic" and "give[s] you allergies." The podcast has racked up nearly 2 million views on YouTube. Likewise, Children's Health Defense, the rabid anti-vaccine organization &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/robert-f-kennedy-jr-announces-the-launch-of-childrens-health-defense-300710874.html"&gt;Kennedy created in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, has also made &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/search/?search=aluminum"&gt;wild claims about the safety of aluminum adjuvants&lt;/a&gt;. That includes linking it to &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/high-aluminum-found-autism-brain-tissue/"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;, despite that &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/wp-content/uploads/catg.d/p4026.pdf"&gt;many high-quality scientific studies&lt;/a&gt; have found &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2908388/"&gt;no link&lt;/a&gt; between any vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While anti-vaccine advocates like Kennedy routinely dismiss and attack the plethora of studies that do not support their dangerous claims, the new study should reassure any hesitant parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clear data, unclear future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the study, lead author Niklas Worm Andersson, of the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, and colleagues tapped into Denmark's national registry to analyze medical records of over 1.2 million children born in the country between 1997 and 2018. During that time, new vaccines were introduced and recommendations shifted, creating variation in how many aluminum-containing vaccines children received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily intake of processed meats or sugary drinks may raise risk for diabetes, heart disease and cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating 50 grams of processed meat daily may raise type 2 diabetes risk by 30%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New findings in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; stress that small dietary changes can significantly reduce chronic disease risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We’ve all heard that processed meats, sugary drinks and trans fats aren’t great for our health, but just how bad are they? While past studies have linked these foods to diabetes and other chronic conditions, such as heart disease and cancer, we haven’t had a strong understanding of the dose-response relationship: i.e., to what level our body reacts to how much or how little of a given food we consume.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To gain a better understanding, researchers delved deeper into the data, examining the impact of processed meats, sugary beverages and trans fats on our health. Using cutting-edge methods to account for differences across studies, researchers uncovered more detailed evidence linking these foods to serious health risks. These findings were recently published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In this study, researchers reviewed and analyzed data to explore the connections between certain foods, like processed meats, sugary drinks and trans fats, and specific health outcomes. They looked at how processed meats are linked to type 2 diabetes, heart disease and colorectal cancer; how sugary drinks are tied to type 2 diabetes and heart disease; and how trans fats are associated with heart disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers identified the following associations between specific foods and health outcomes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Processed Meats  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers found a link between eating processed meat and a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The risk increased steadily with increasing consumption of processed meat, but the most significant jump in risk occurred at lower levels of intake.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What does that mean? Eating 50 grams of processed meat daily (about two to three breakfast sausages) was associated with a 30% higher risk of type 2 diabetes compared to eating no processed meat at all.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To provide a more cautious estimate, the researchers used a method known as the Burden of Proof risk function. This showed that eating processed meat in typical amounts (ranging from about 0.6 to 57 grams per day) was linked to at least an 11% higher risk of type 2 diabetes compared to eating none. While this estimate is conservative, it still underscores a connection between processed meat consumption and the risk of diabetes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to other chronic conditions, researchers found that the risk of heart disease increased slightly with processed meat consumption, but the overall association was small. When it comes to colorectal cancer risk, researchers found that the risk rises as processed meat consumption goes up. For example, eating 50 grams of processed meat daily (about two to three breakfast sausages) was associated with a 26% higher risk of developing colorectal cancer compared to eating none.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Sugary Beverages &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers analyzed studies including more than 560,000 participants. They found that drinking about 8 ounces of sugary drinks daily was associated with a 20% higher risk of type 2 diabetes compared to not drinking any at all.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The analysis also showed that drinking more sugary beverages is linked to a steady increase in the risk of heart disease. The results revealed that drinking about 8 ounces of sugary drinks daily was associated with a 7% higher risk of heart disease compared to not drinking any at all.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Trans Fats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The analysis did not look at the association between consuming trans fats in the diet and diabetes risk. When it comes to trans fats, researchers assessed their connection to the risk of heart disease, finding that consuming 1% of daily calories from trans fats was associated with an 11% higher risk of heart disease compared to consuming none.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The review is primarily based on observational studies, which have a significant limitation in determining cause and effect. Observational studies only show associations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While researchers adjusted for factors like age, weight and physical activity, there may still be unmeasured factors that could influence the results. Additionally, most studies relied on food frequency questionnaires to measure what people ate, but these self-reports can be prone to errors, as participants may forget or misreport their food intake.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study offers valuable insights into the impact of everyday dietary choices on long-term health. While we’ve all heard that processed meats, sugary drinks and trans fats aren’t the healthiest options, this research highlights the risks in a way that’s easier to understand. For example, it shows that even moderate consumption of these foods, like a daily serving of processed meat or a sugary drink, is linked to an increased risk of serious conditions like type 2 diabetes. These findings emphasize the importance of making mindful food choices, such as reducing consumption of processed meats and sugary drinks, to lower the risk of chronic diseases.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine,&lt;/em&gt; sheds light on the real health risks associated with processed meats, sugary drinks, and trans fats. The key takeaway is that small, mindful changes in your diet can make a big difference. Reducing your intake of processed meats and cutting back on sugary drinks can help lower your risk of diabetes and other health conditions like heart disease and colorectal cancer. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the risks may seem modest on an individual level, they accumulate over time and across populations, making these findings important not only for personal health but also for public health initiatives. This study serves as a reminder that even small steps toward healthier eating can lead to meaningful improvements in overall well-being.

The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Turku and published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;’s ‘Healthy Longevity’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In clinical practice, detecting beta-amyloid pathology associated with Alzheimer’s disease currently requires imaging studies or cerebrospinal fluid sampling,” said Suvi Rovio, senior researcher at the Research Centre of Applied and Preventive Cardiovascular Medicine at the University of Turku.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, recently developed ultrasensitive measurement technologies now allow the detection of Alzheimer’s disease-related brain biomarkers from blood samples.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that certain factors, such as increasing age and kidney disease, were associated with higher levels of biomarkers even before cognitive decline set in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found that the APOE ε4 gene, a known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s, was linked to higher biomarker levels in older individuals - although it did not yet appear to influence levels in those under the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the researchers cautioned that blood tests are not yet suitable for diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In order to reliably use blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis in the future, more research is needed across different populations and age groups to standardise reference values,” Ms Rovio said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marja Heiskanen, another senior researcher involved in the project, said the findings offer new insight into &lt;a href="/topic/brain-health"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt; from middle age onwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Until now, brain biomarkers associated with &lt;a href="/topic/alzheimers-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; have mainly been studied in older individuals.

The United Kingdom, for example, doesn’t recommend routine adult boosters and has maintained low rates of both diseases, even during a 2022 influx of more than 70 diphtheria cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="X7HRTR64UFHVFHAKUGYPQ7WZQY"&gt;The World Health Organization dropped its recommendation for routine adult boosters in 2017, advising them only in specific circumstances such as pregnancy, travel, or wound care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YXBKNZR7OFGPROTROSIIYEJOGQ"&gt;Meanwhile, more than 18 million Americans receive these boosters annually, costing over $1 billion.

Researchers analyzed 50 chronic conditions — including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), ADHD, asthma, and juvenile arthritis — and found no association with cumulative aluminum exposure from vaccines given before age two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when stratified by sex, birth cohort, and follow-up duration, results consistently showed no elevated risk. These findings strongly support the safety of aluminum-adsorbed vaccines and reinforce their role in protecting children without harming their development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Neurological Harm:&lt;/strong&gt; Aluminum exposure from vaccines was not linked to autism, ADHD, or other neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Immune Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; Autoimmune and allergic conditions like asthma and eczema were unaffected by aluminum in vaccines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large-Scale Evidence:&lt;/strong&gt; Over 1.2 million children studied, with consistent results across groups and follow-up periods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For decades, aluminum in childhood vaccines has been the subject of scientific scrutiny, media headlines, and parental worry. Aluminum salts, used as adjuvants in vaccines to boost the immune response, are an integral part of routine immunizations worldwide, including those given in infancy and early childhood. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet questions have persisted: could repeated exposure to aluminum from vaccines harm a child’s developing brain or immune system?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could it raise the risk of neurological conditions like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or contribute to autoimmune or allergic diseases?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A landmark Danish study now provides the most comprehensive answer yet: no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, the study analyzed a nationwide cohort of more than 1.2 million children born in Denmark between 1997 and 2018, following them for up to eight years to assess the risk of developing 50 chronic disorders, including 36 autoimmune diseases, nine allergic or atopic conditions, and five neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were unequivocal: there was no evidence of increased risk of any of these conditions associated with higher cumulative aluminum exposure from vaccines administered in the first two years of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the study even found slightly lower hazard ratios for some outcomes, including ASD and ADHD, among children with higher aluminum exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Natural Experiment on a National Scale&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the unique strengths of this study was its use of real-world, population-level data across a 24-year period. During this time, Denmark’s national vaccination program underwent several policy-driven changes, replacing or supplementing certain vaccines with others that contained different amounts of aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes created what researchers call a “natural experiment,” allowing them to measure the effects of varying aluminum exposure in children while controlling for individual health and demographic factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By linking data from Denmark’s medical birth registry, vaccination records, hospital diagnoses, and prescription data, the researchers were able to build a rich picture of each child’s medical history and cumulative aluminum exposure. On average, vaccinated children received a median cumulative dose of about 3 milligrams of aluminum by age two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children were then followed from age two for diagnoses of any of the 50 chronic conditions of interest, which included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autoimmune disorders&lt;/strong&gt; like type 1 diabetes, juvenile arthritis, and autoimmune thyroid disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allergic and atopic conditions&lt;/strong&gt; such as asthma, atopic dermatitis (eczema), allergic rhinitis, and food allergies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurodevelopmental disorders&lt;/strong&gt;, with particular focus on autism spectrum disorder (ASD), ADHD, Asperger syndrome, and related conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed no evidence of harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Reassuring Findings Across the Board&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the combined group of autoimmune disorders, the adjusted hazard ratio per additional milligram of aluminum exposure was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.94–1.02), meaning no meaningful increase in risk. Similarly, the hazard ratio for allergic or atopic conditions was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.98–1.01).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most notably, for neurodevelopmental disorders — a focus of much public concern — the hazard ratio was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90–0.97), suggesting no elevated risk. When broken down further:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD): hazard ratio 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89–0.97)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ADHD: hazard ratio 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84–0.96)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Asperger syndrome and atypical autism also showed no significant increase.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for the most common allergic conditions like asthma and eczema, there was no evidence of harm. In fact, the hazard ratio for asthma — the most frequently diagnosed outcome — was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94–0.98), again showing no elevated risk associated with aluminum in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that these findings are “incompatible with moderate to large increases in risk” for any of the conditions examined, even when they extended follow-up to age eight and performed subgroup analyses by sex, birth cohort, and vaccine type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Putting Concerns in Context&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aluminum adjuvants have been used in vaccines for over 90 years and are essential for eliciting a strong and lasting immune response to certain vaccine antigens. The total aluminum exposure from vaccines in the first two years of life — typically around 3 milligrams — is well below established toxicological safety thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why have concerns persisted?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the worry stems from animal studies, which showed neurotoxic effects of aluminum at much higher doses than those used in human vaccines, and from ecological or small observational studies that suggested possible associations with autism or autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, such studies often lacked rigorous control for confounding factors or were conducted under experimental conditions not comparable to human vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new Danish study addresses these limitations by analyzing human data at an unprecedented scale and controlling for key variables like maternal smoking, socioeconomic status, and maternal medical history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Strengths and Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sheer size and scope of this study — covering children born in Denmark over two decades — make it one of the most robust investigations of vaccine safety to date. Its use of comprehensive national health registries allowed researchers to follow outcomes objectively and uniformly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors acknowledged some limitations: because they relied on routinely collected registry data, they could not individually review medical records. Some rare disorders could not be analyzed in detail due to their very low incidence, and the study could not entirely rule out very small risks for extremely rare outcomes or risks manifesting later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers concluded that any such risks would have to be so small as to be “incompatible with moderate to large increases in risk,” and thus unlikely to meaningfully influence public health recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current climate of vaccine hesitancy, this study provides critical reassurance for parents, healthcare providers, and policymakers. With social media amplifying misinformation and skepticism, robust evidence like this helps counter false narratives and reinforce confidence in childhood immunization programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the authors note, “our findings strengthen the case for maintaining high vaccination rates — and protecting children not only from preventable infections, but also from misplaced fears.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines remain one of the most effective public health tools available. The diseases they prevent — diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Hib, and others — can cause severe illness, disability, and death. The inclusion of aluminum as an adjuvant ensures these vaccines work effectively while remaining safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study underscores that safety, showing that children exposed to aluminum through vaccines grow up just as healthy, neurologically, immunologically, and developmentally, as those who receive less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research may continue to monitor long-term outcomes into adolescence and adulthood and to investigate extremely rare disorders. But for now, the evidence is clear: aluminum-adsorbed vaccines do not harm children’s brains, immune systems, or allergic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents can take comfort in knowing that vaccinating their children protects them from serious diseases without increasing the risk of chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As vaccine scientists noted, “Vaccines are among the most scrutinized medical interventions in history — and still among the safest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new research is a powerful addition to that body of scrutiny and reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this vaccine safety and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Communications – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Aluminum-Adsorbed Vaccines and Chronic Diseases in Childhood: A Nationwide Cohort Study&lt;/a&gt;” by Niklas Worm Andersson et al. &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aluminum-Adsorbed Vaccines and Chronic Diseases in Childhood: A Nationwide Cohort Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aluminum is used as an adjuvant in nonlive vaccines administered in early childhood. Concerns persist about potential associations between vaccination with aluminum-adsorbed vaccines and increased risk for chronic autoimmunity, atopy or allergy, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Large-scale safety data remain limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Objective:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the association between cumulative aluminum exposure from early childhood vaccination and risk for autoimmune, atopic or allergic, and neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Design:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cohort study linking nationwide registry data on childhood vaccinations, outcome diagnoses, and potential confounders, leveraging the variations in the aluminum content of childhood vaccines over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Setting:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denmark, 1997 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Participants:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 224 176 children born in Denmark between 1997 and 2018 who were alive and residing in the country at age 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intervention:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cumulative aluminum amount received (per 1-mg increase) through vaccination during the first 2 years of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Measurements:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incident events of 50 chronic disorders, including autoimmune (dermatologic, endocrinologic, hematologic, gastrointestinal, and rheumatic), atopic or allergic (asthma, atopic dermatitis, rhinoconjunctivitis, and allergy), and neurodevelopmental (autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cumulative aluminum exposure from vaccination during the first 2 years of life was not associated with increased rates of any of the 50 disorders assessed. For groups of combined outcomes, adjusted hazard ratios per 1-mg increase in aluminum exposure were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.94 to 1.02) for any autoimmune disorder, 0.99 (CI, 0.98 to 1.01) for any atopic or allergic disorder, and 0.93 (CI, 0.90 to 0.97) for any neurodevelopmental disorder. For most individually analyzed outcomes, the upper bounds of the 95% CIs were incompatible with relative increases greater than 10% or 30%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Limitation:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual medical records were not reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This nationwide cohort study did not find evidence supporting an increased risk for autoimmune, atopic or allergic, or neurodevelopmental disorders associated with early childhood exposure to aluminum-adsorbed vaccines. For most outcomes, the findings were inconsistent with moderate to large relative increases in risk, although small relative effects, particularly for some rarer disorders, could not be statistically excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Primary Funding Source:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;None.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 20:48:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE80cFV5WlZGakZDa1JMbnN0cldBZjRqdkVqVmxkU0xzbzRGdHk2dVZFd245Rl9FUkVkb3RMZUlVUk9KQnR3cURkMHF4QTZFMnMwdHZ0SnA4ZHliWFlPNmNmcV85OFl5LUNleldxR3Q2Yw</guid></item><item><title>PHMDC在药物过量服用增加后发布公共卫生警报- Channel 3000 | PHMDC issues public health alert after increase in drug overdoses - Channel 3000</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4gFBVV95cUxOelB2cVNMS0dINmNnWThXZ3ZnY1otcE1VaW1kNjBKakk2MDVVc0xZTDNZZTQzaDYwZmhrR3czcElWd0k1UUJ2QTR0VEwwUGs3ZFlUbGY3R1MyNWZITWVVc3BuVjZGU1FYLTBTUnBKM2RKeEFfcDdBWFZlaHlLMmM2UG1nd0ZCLUppUGZaVXp6NnM0UmNqRF81WHJ0NXE2d3pNQUhxR1F1UHR0QW9fNVRoUXJlb0VrNHFwaEYtcDlscHdpRm54MFduTXV6aU5OT1Bjbnl1UTUyTjI1RVVVTDVack5n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;MADISON, Wis. -- Public Health Madison &amp;amp; Dane County issued a public health alert on Tuesday due to an increase in drug overdoses in Dane County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHMDC reported the alert is based on data from hospitals and EMS providers. Within 24 hours, July 13 to July 14, there were five confirmed overdose response calls from EMS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unknown what is driving this spike. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Drug use during the summer months can also increase the risk of heat-related illnesses, like heat stroke and dehydration." "This is because certain types of drugs raise core body temperature and interfere with the body’s ability to regulate temperature,” said Public Health Supervisor Julia Olson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or someone you know is using drugs, PHMDC gave the following tips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=misAs9xKO8s" target="_blank"&gt;Know the signs of an overdose:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pale, sweaty or clammy skin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lips/fingertips turn blue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slow or irregular breathing: gasping, gurgling, or snoring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficult or unable to wake&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always call 911 if you think someone is overdosing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t use street drugs alone; call Never Use Alone at 800-484-3731&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Check in with your friends/family who use drugs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Test all drugs for fentanyl before using&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carry Narcan® (naloxone) and be prepared to use multiple doses when needed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get safer use supplies, like fentanyl test strips and Narcan®, from the Syringe Services Program at Public Health Madison &amp;amp; Dane County: 2705 E.

Scientists found that older musicians showed more efficient brain connectivity and better performance than non-musicians of the same age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that musical training builds cognitive reserve, preserving brain networks and reducing the need for age-related compensatory mechanisms. The findings support the idea that positive lifestyle choices like learning music can mitigate age-related cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Older musicians outperformed peers on speech-in-noise tasks, with more youthful brain connectivity patterns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Functional MRI showed that musical training preserved the integrity of auditory and motor brain networks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The study supports the “Hold-Back Upregulation” hypothesis: cognitive reserve maintains brain efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-term musical training may mitigate the age-related decline in speech perception by enhancing cognitive reserve, according to a study published July 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology &lt;/em&gt;by Claude Alain from the Baycrest Academy for Research and Education, Canada, and Yi Du from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal aging is typically associated with declines in sensory and cognitive functions. These age-related changes in perception and cognition are often accompanied by increased neural activity and functional connectivity – the statistical dependence of activity between different brain regions – in widely distributed neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111656"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older man playing piano and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;As predicted, the results revealed reduced age-related declines in speech-in-noise performance among older musicians compared to older non-musicians.  Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recruitment of neural activity and strengthening of functional connectivity are thought to reflect a compensatory strategy employed by older adults to maintain optimal cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive lifestyle choices, such as musical training, higher levels of education, and bilingualism, contribute to cognitive and brain reserve, which represents the accumulation of cognitive and neural resources before the onset of age-related brain changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive Reserve Theory suggests that this reserve accrued through experience and training can help mitigate the impact of age-related brain decline, leading to better-than-expected cognitive performance. Yet how cumulative reserves influenced by positive lifestyle factors affect neural activity in older populations remains controversial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this question, the researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity in 25 older musicians, 25 older non-musicians, and 24 young non-musicians who were asked to identify syllables masked by noise sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused their analysis on neural responses within the auditory dorsal stream, which includes auditory, inferior parietal, dorsal frontal motor, and frontal motor areas, supporting sound-to-action mapping and sensorimotor integration during speech processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As predicted, the results revealed reduced age-related declines in speech-in-noise performance among older musicians compared to older non-musicians. During speech-in-noise perception, the older non-musicians showed the typical age-related compensatory increase in functional connectivity in auditory dorsal streams bilaterally (i.e., in both hemispheres of the brain).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, older musicians exhibited a connectivity pattern in bilateral auditory dorsal streams that resembled young non-musicians, with connectivity strength in the right dorsal stream correlating with speech-in-noise perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, older musicians exhibited more youth-like spatial pattern of functional connectivity during the task, whereas older non-musicians consistently showed a spatial pattern that deviated from young non-musicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings support the “Hold-Back Upregulation” hypothesis, which posits that cognitive reserve from musical training promotes a more youthful functional connectivity pattern, leading to superior behavioral outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond merely compensating for age-related declines, cognitive reserve may work by maintaining the integrity and functional architecture of neural networks, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of aging on cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But due to the study design, it was not possible to determine cause-and-effect relationships between musical training and performance in the perception task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, future studies should further test the “Hold-Back Upregulation” hypothesis using different cognitive tasks, such as memory and attention tasks, and investigate other sources of reserve, such as physical exercise and bilingualism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, these findings may inform interventions aimed at preserving cognitive function and improving communication outcomes in aging populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lei Zhang adds, “A positive lifestyle helps older adults cope better with cognitive ageing, and it is never too late to take up, and stick with, a rewarding hobby such as learning an instrument.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Yi Du adds, “Just like a well-tuned instrument doesn’t need to be played louder to be heard, the brains of older musicians stay finely tuned thanks to years of training. Our study shows that this musical experience builds cognitive reserve, helping their brains avoid the usual age-related overexertion when trying to understand speech in noisy places.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by STI 2030—Major Project (2021ZD0201500, https://service.most.gov.cn/) to YD, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (RGPIN-2021-02721, https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp) to CA, and Canadian Institute for Health Research (PJT 183614, https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/193.html) to CA.

          &lt;h2 class="AlignCenter"&gt;Ultra-Processed Foods: The Smoking Gun Behind the Obesity Epidemic&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years, the mainstream chorus has been singing the same tired tune:&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It’s just calories in, calories out.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Move more, eat less, and voilà—problem solved. But a new study published in&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PNAS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;just torched that simplistic model and handed the mic to what many dismissed as fringe theory: ultra-processed foods (UPFs) aren’t just empty calories—they’re metabolic saboteurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Study Breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers ran a tightly controlled trial comparing diets rich in UPFs versus minimally processed foods. The results? People eating UPFs consumed significantly more calories and gained weight—&lt;strong&gt;even though both diets were matched for macros, fiber, sugar, and sodium&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s not just a crack in the calories-in/calories-out wall. It’s a wrecking ball.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;UPFs mess with satiety signals, gut hormones, and reward pathways. They’re engineered to be hyper-palatable and easy to overconsume. You’re not just eating food—you’re eating a product designed to override your body’s natural brakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exercise Isn’t the Fix&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study didn’t let participants slack off. Physical activity was monitored and held constant. Still, those on the UPF-heavy diet gained weight. So no, your morning jog isn’t going to undo the damage from a dinner of frozen pizza and neon-orange snack dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image-captioned align-right"&gt;&lt;img alt="Obesity4.png" src="https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1456812/large/Obesity4.png?1752607564" title="Obesity4.png"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Calling Out the System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t about moralizing food choices or shaming bodies. It’s about calling out a system that’s been gaslighting people into thinking their weight is just a personal failure of willpower. It’s not. It’s biochemical warfare disguised as convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Final Word&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So next time someone parrots&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;“just eat less and move more,”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;hand them this study. Then ask them why Big Food keeps pumping out edible plastics while public health spirals. Spoiler: it’s not because they care about your macros.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4t27hd00691dktf9c9yw1w@published"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the United States secretary of health and human services, has some strong opinions about teeth. Specifically, he seems to kind of hate fluoride, a mineral that, when added to the public drinking water in small amounts, can prevent dental decay. Despite what Kennedy claims, there are &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/01/fluoride-childrens-iq-study-pregnancy-science.html"&gt;no proven negative side effects&lt;/a&gt; of doing this. So far this year, Utah and Florida have banned fluoride in their drinking water, and a &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/05/16/fluoride-bans-states-florida-utah/83667361007/"&gt;slew of other states&lt;/a&gt; are considering doing the same. Without fluoride in the water, “you’re going to see probably slightly more cavities,” RFK Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/06/27/rfk-jr-fluoride-more-cavities-balance/84382999007/"&gt;recently admitted&lt;/a&gt; on Fox News.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpk001j3b775jw5nlhe@published"&gt;That cavalier attitude about a rise in cavities has upset a lot of dentists. Cavities aren’t trivial—they can result in a lot of pain. “Dental decay is a &lt;em&gt;disease&lt;/em&gt;,” Barry Taylor, executive director of Oregon Dental Association, told me. “Essentially, he’s saying: There will be more disease.” The American Dental Association “is very concerned for people of all ages and socioeconomic status” in communities stopping water fluoridation, a spokesperson wrote in an email. “People who suffer from untreated dental disease miss millions of school and work hours,” they added. So far, RFK Jr. is not looking great for America’s teeth.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpk001k3b77vzuh0y04@published"&gt;When Slate saw the above not-so-flattering image in a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/insurers-wont-say-if-theyll-pay-for-childhood-vaccines-dropped-from-recommended-schedule/"&gt;recent Wired article&lt;/a&gt;, we had to wonder, &lt;a href="https://www.threads.com/@nicmonsees/post/DLnVWcwzJdA/what-is-even-happening-here-with-rfk-jrs-teeth-and-gums"&gt;as others&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/1lppwoz/what_the_hell_is_happening_in_rfk_jrs_mouth/"&gt;did&lt;/a&gt;, if Kennedy is not great for his &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; teeth. His mouth looks a little … grimy. Is it possible the man is against not just fluoride but also toothbrushes and floss? I called up a few dentists to see what they might make of his incisors. (Here, I’ll state the requisite caveat: It’s impossible to diagnose from a single photo and without a full dental workup.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpl001l3b772tc71rb3@published"&gt;There’s a lot to unpack. “The first thought is, he needs to brush his teeth,” Taylor said. “It may just be a picture that was taken after lunch, and he has a piece of Windsor clam or something in there, I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="128" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpl001m3b77kaq4e30p@published"&gt;Other dentists were less sure about the wad of yellowish stuff stuck between his left front tooth and the tooth next to it. When I showed the picture to my own dentist, he thought it looked most like calculus—hardened plaque—though, he said, that usually forms across multiple teeth. Arosha Weerakoon, a professor in dentistry at the University of Queensland, in Australia, suggested that it could be something called Valplast, a type of flexible denture—perhaps that front tooth of his is fake. Though the consensus was that most if not all of RFK Jr.’s teeth look as if they are probably real, which is “pretty big for that age,” my dentist noted. (Kennedy is 71 years old, and most people have replaced at least a few teeth by then.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="141" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpl001n3b77tf2lmlcv@published"&gt;He got high marks for his gums too. There’s some darkening at the point where tooth meets gum, which indicates recession. But that happens naturally with aging, Weerakoon said, and at a glance, the extent of RFK Jr.’s recession appears to be in line with what you might expect at 71. Notably, his gums aren’t puffy, which would indicate gum disease. (Another controversial figure who likely &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have gum disease: Elon Musk. &lt;a href="https://dentalwiseturkey.com/elon-musk-teeth/"&gt;That puffy part by his front tooth&lt;/a&gt;? “It’s severely inflamed,” Weerakoon said. A slight touch to that area while speaking or eating, and “that’d be bleeding everywhere.”) Gum disease is &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21482-gum-periodontal-disease"&gt;most often caused by the buildup of plaque&lt;/a&gt;, which consists of bacteria that can infect the gums. Oral hygiene—especially brushing and flossing—is important to prevent gum disease. So Kennedy’s nice gums suggest that he may, generally, be a flosser.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpm001o3b77ysdxu7lv@published"&gt;There’s also the matter of the white strip on his top gum. Taylor suggested that it could be medical tape used to cover a surgical site. Weerakoon asked her dentist friends about it, and they came to a different conclusion: “It’s a Zyn.” That’s also what my own dentist thought. A friend and extracurricular Zyn expert whom I checked with concurred that it looks identical to the nicotine pouch that people push into their gums. It aligns, too, with public speculation back in January that RFK Jr. &lt;a href="https://people.com/rfk-jr-speculation-nicotine-pouch-confirmation-hearing-8783718"&gt;popped a Zyn&lt;/a&gt; during a confirmation hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpm001p3b77v01xq99j@published"&gt;Taken together, while the average person might recoil from this pic, it’s not damning of Kennedy’s dental hygiene. “If I was at a cocktail party, I’d be thinking, ‘decent teeth,’ ” said Taylor. “Just from that one picture, it appears that he has had good dental care in his life.” But what about the discoloring? Weerakoon notes that the slight difference between the two left teeth is likely due to a knock on the left tooth, which could have killed the tooth’s nerve. (I have the misfortune of an identical discoloring on the same exact tooth due to a slip on a rock.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="144" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpm001q3b77ax38ympe@published"&gt;The rest of the yellowing is a sign not of bad hygiene but of natural teeth “within a range of normal for that age,” Taylor said. All teeth yellow with time, and no amount of brushing and mouthwash can fix that—you’d have to have veneers or get bleach treatments, common choices for many Americans, particularly those in the &lt;a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2004/07/what-nice-teeth-the-democrats-have.html"&gt;public eye&lt;/a&gt;. Veneers are &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/why-does-everyone-in-hollywood-have-veneers-now"&gt;a norm in Hollywood now&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s even &lt;a href="https://www.hiltonheadcosmeticdentist.com/president-trump-wear-porcelain-veneers/"&gt;speculation&lt;/a&gt; that Donald Trump’s too-perfect teeth &lt;a href="https://www.bhdentists.com/blog/donald-trumps-smile-care-secrets/"&gt;are actually veneers&lt;/a&gt;. The interesting truth is that teeth don’t have to necessarily &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; good to be in good condition—in fact, natural teeth will almost certainly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; look “good” (i.e., white, spot-free, straight). So here I might throw RFK Jr. a bone: He’s not feeling any sort of pressure for his teeth to perfectly look the part. You could even say he’s helping to redefine dental beauty standards.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpm001r3b77c3a0zl5d@published"&gt;The fact that RFK Jr.’s teeth are largely in dentist-approved shape, though, is really the point. Although the fluoridation of public water that he opposes can benefit everyone, it’s consistently found to be most beneficial to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2834515"&gt;people with low incomes or who live in rural areas&lt;/a&gt;. There are other ways to get fluoride: toothpaste with fluoride or a professional fluoride treatment at your dentist’s office. And there are other important steps to keep your teeth in good shape and fight cavities: eating a healthy diet, brushing and flossing, regularly visiting the dentist. But all of these options require a certain level of access to resources, money, time, and health education.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="65" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpn001s3b77i61q9mp2@published"&gt;“RFK can afford any dentist anytime he wants to,” said Weerakoon. “So he can afford to go without water fluoridation.” For those who aren’t as fortunate, fluoridation is a great, inexpensive option to reduce cavities among all populations; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has given the process the distinction of being “&lt;a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/pcd/2015/04/23/community-water-fluoridation-one-of-the-10-greatest-public-health-achievements-of-the-20th-century/"&gt;one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpn001t3b77mnp979qy@published"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2834515"&gt;recent study projected&lt;/a&gt; that complete fluoridation removal from drinking water in the U.S. would lead to an increase of roughly 25.4 million cases of decayed teeth in children and cost approximately $9.8 billion over five years in health care expenses. Low-income communities will be hardest hit. Dental disease isn’t just a cavity here and there. It can cause millions of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/school-health-conditions/chronic/oral-health.html"&gt;missed school days&lt;/a&gt; among children; cost someone a job or create significant quality-of-life challenges due to social stigma; and, some research suggests, even result in complications such as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/dental/art-20047475#:~:text=Some%20research%20suggests%20that%20heart,birth%20and%20low%20birth%20weight"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpn001u3b774t6aqse1@published"&gt;Kids, who cannot go out and buy fluoride toothpaste for themselves, will be particularly harmed by RFK Jr.’s anti-fluoride crusade. Weerakoon saw firsthand what could become more common in the States when working at a &lt;a href="https://www.health.qld.gov.au/public-health/industry-environment/environment-land-water/water/fluoridation"&gt;school in Queensland&lt;/a&gt; where many children were not drinking fluoridated water. She had a 4-year-old patient with so many holes in his teeth that he had to have all them removed. And yet, tooth decay &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/oral-health"&gt;is largely preventable&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re protecting those who are most vulnerable,” Weerakoon said, “that don’t have an opportunity to help &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;themselves.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;For generations, chicken soup has been &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002067.htm"&gt;a go-to remedy&lt;/a&gt; for people feeling under the weather. It holds a cherished place in many cultures as a comforting treatment for colds and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="167855" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is there any real science behind the idea that soup can help us recover from respiratory infections?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside colleagues, I conducted a &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/13/2247"&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; to explore this question, which examined the scientific evidence on the role of soup in managing acute respiratory tract infections, such as the common cold,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="167855" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="167855" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of more than 10,000 records, we identified four high-quality studies involving 342 participants. These studies tested a variety of soups, including &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/does-chicken-soup-really-help-when-youre-sick-a-nutrition-specialist-explains-whats-behind-the-beloved-comfort-food-213847"&gt;traditional chicken broth&lt;/a&gt;, barley soup, and herbal vegetable blends. While still early-stage, the evidence was promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chicken-soup-has-been-a-remedy-for-thousands-of-years-but-why?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Chicken Soup Has Been a Remedy For Thousands of Years… But Why?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9391229/"&gt;One study found&lt;/a&gt; that people who ate soup recovered up to 2.5 days faster than those who didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms such as nasal congestion, sore throat and fatigue were milder. Some participants also showed reduced levels of &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/ageing-isnt-the-same-everywhere-why-inflammation-may-be-a-lifestyle-problem-260322"&gt;inflammation-related&lt;/a&gt; markers: substances in the blood that rise when the immune system is fighting an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, levels of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4176007/"&gt;IL-6&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha"&gt;TNF-α&lt;/a&gt; – two proteins that help trigger inflammation – were lower in those who consumed soup. This suggests that soup may help calm an overactive immune response, potentially making symptoms less severe and recovery more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, none of the studies examined how consuming soup influenced everyday outcomes of acute respiratory tract infections, such as whether people took fewer days off work or were less likely to end up in hospital. That's a major gap in the evidence, and one that future research needs to address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/can-chicken-soup-really-cure-body-and-soul-52357"&gt;are several reasons soup&lt;/a&gt; may help. It's warm, hydrating and &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/is-soup-healthy"&gt;typically nutrient-rich&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ingredients like garlic, onion, ginger and leafy greens have &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4267963/"&gt;anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7402177/"&gt;antimicrobial&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8389214/"&gt;immune-supportive&lt;/a&gt; properties. The warmth can also help loosen mucus, soothe sore throats and promote overall comfort during illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167894" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167894" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/soup_when_sick_642.jpg" alt="woman eating soup" class="wp-image-167894 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/soup_when_sick_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/soup_when_sick_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167894" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ancient wisdom sometimes persists for good reason. (GoodLifeStudio/Getty Images Signature/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Not just nourishment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also a strong cultural and behavioral aspect to food-based self-care: when people use food not just for nourishment, but as an intentional part of managing illness and promoting recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many households, food becomes medicine not only because of its ingredients, but because it symbolizes care, routine and reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My previous research found that &lt;a href="https://www.dovepress.com/parent-use-of-complementary-medicine-remedies-and-services-for-the-man-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-JMDH"&gt;parents, in particular&lt;/a&gt; often &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1744388120301900?via%3Dihub"&gt;turn to traditional remedies&lt;/a&gt;, like soup, as a first line of defense when illness strikes, often well before seeking professional medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reflects &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229917309056?via%3Dihub"&gt;a growing interest in home remedies&lt;/a&gt; and the importance of culturally familiar treatments: remedies that feel safe, trusted and emotionally resonant because they're part of a person's upbringing or community norms. These kinds of treatments can increase confidence and comfort when self-managing illness at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food-based self-care may become increasingly important as pressure on healthcare systems continues to grow. With rising concerns about &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance"&gt;antimicrobial resistance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/33/11/738"&gt;overstretched services&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.576229/full"&gt;lingering trauma from global pandemics&lt;/a&gt;, simple, evidence-informed home treatments can play a crucial role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They help people manage mild illness, reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and avoid placing additional strain on GPs or &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/dec/31/big-rise-in-people-going-to-ae-in-england-for-minor-ailments-data-shows"&gt;emergency departments for minor ailments&lt;/a&gt; that can be safely treated at home. Even a simple phone &lt;a href="https://www.gponline.com/simple-phone-message-common-cold-cuts-gp-appointment-waits-21/article/1581517"&gt;message about the common cold&lt;/a&gt; – "Most common colds get better in a few days and don't need treatment from your GP" – has been shown to reduce appointment demand by 21 percent, highlighting how low-cost, home-based care could ease pressure across the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Local Government Association (LGA) &lt;a href="https://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/22.32%20-%20Self%20Care%20Publication_02.1_1WEB.pdf"&gt;reports that&lt;/a&gt; GPs handle approximately 57 million cases of minor conditions such as coughs and colds annually, costing the NHS over £2 billion a year. &lt;a href="https://www.local.gov.uk/topics/social-care-health-and-integration/role-councils-promoting-self-care"&gt;It argues that&lt;/a&gt; educating people about &lt;a href="https://www.pagb.co.uk/content/uploads/2024/01/PAGB-Self-Care-Survey-2023.pdf"&gt;effective self-care&lt;/a&gt; could help save GPs an hour a day on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Soup fits the bill&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So chicken soup is easy to prepare, affordable, safe for most people and widely recognized as a comforting, familiar home remedy for minor illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, our review highlighted a clear need for more research. Future studies could examine standardized soup recipes and investigate whether particular combinations of nutrients or herbs work best: does chicken soup have the same effect as barley broth or vegetable potage? Is there a difference if it's homemade versus canned?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as importantly, future research needs to measure meaningful outcomes: how quickly people return to work or school, how well they sleep during illness, how they rate their comfort and energy levels, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soup isn't a replacement for medicine. But alongside rest, fluids and paracetamol, it might offer a simple way to ease symptoms and help people feel better.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260960/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;
