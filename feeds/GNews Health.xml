The results are clear: LAAC was worse than best medical therapy. The saddest thing is that the German trial comes not before but &lt;em&gt;after &lt;/em&gt;more than a half-million patients have been implanted with Watchman devices worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My long-standing &lt;a href="https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/www.medscape.com/viewarticle/871678___.YzJ1OndlYm1kOmM6ZzoxZDBmZGJkZjM2NjNmNjUyMjRkOTU3ZDQyMThhN2Q4Njo3OjE5OWQ6NzkzOTM5ZGNmNDZiZGQ1ZDMzYjI0MjBmYzA0N2ZlOGIyMzViZjQ4ZmNkMDU0ZDE5YmI5MjFjYjE0Nzc2MTk3MTpwOlQ6Rg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;argument against &lt;/a&gt;percutaneous LAAC stems from signals of inefficacy in the seminal trials against warfarin. CLOSURE-AF investigators found similar signals comparing the devices to mostly direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOAC). Over the past decade, both device and anticoagulants have iterated, yet the results are similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The CLOSURE-AF Trial &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trial results have &lt;a href="https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/eppro02.ativ.me/web/planner.php?id=AHA25&amp;amp;table=agenda&amp;amp;tid=517238___.YzJ1OndlYm1kOmM6ZzoxZDBmZGJkZjM2NjNmNjUyMjRkOTU3ZDQyMThhN2Q4Njo3OmFlZDA6NTE0MTY3OGNhZjE0YzgzYWFiYjc4NmI1YmIxZTViZDJkMGM3ZGI4ZTMyY2UxYWExYmQ2OGNjMTBkNzU2YzIwNjpwOlQ6Rg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;been presented at AHA&lt;/a&gt;, but not yet published in full. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slightly more than 900 patients were randomly assigned at 42 centers in Germany to either LAAC or “best medical therapy.” LAAC devices included Watchman (54%), Amulet (42%) and LAmbre (4%). The best medical therapy group were mostly treated with DOACs (85%), vitamin K antagonists were rare (3%), and 10% of patients got no anticoagulant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLOSURE-AF enrolled patients with average CHA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;DS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;VASc and HAS-BLED scores of 5.2 and 3.0, respectively. Their average age was 79 years and 39% were female. These are people at high risk for stroke and bleeding, which is a strength of the trial because in contemporary practice in both the &lt;a href="https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32238316/___.YzJ1OndlYm1kOmM6Zzo0MjgwNmE3YTczMjVmYzBkNzM0ZmE5OWZhNWQyZjc2Nzo3OmE3YTM6MDYzYWQ2YTExMzVlZDM4ZjkwNGQ3YTllMTBjZTQ2ZDM0ZmFjYmQ5MzFiYTE4MTc2MjZiYThmODllNTBiODUwMDpwOlQ6Rg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/www.jacc.org/doi/full/10.1016/j.jacep.2022.06.012___.YzJ1OndlYm1kOmM6Zzo0MjgwNmE3YTczMjVmYzBkNzM0ZmE5OWZhNWQyZjc2Nzo3OjY5N2U6MTYxZmM4OGQ4MWI4ZDllNWEyNzBkMGFmMWZlMTNhZjQyZjNlNzQxYmJlZDdlNjNjY2I5YTQ1ZjJhMDlhMDVlMDpwOlQ6Rg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Europe,&lt;/a&gt; the patients having this procedure are also higher risk than those enrolled in the seminal trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trial conduct was excellent. Very few patients with LAAC remained on oral anticoagulation and the procedure was successful in almost 98% of patients, as defined by technical success and peri-device leak &amp;lt; 5 mm. In the medical arm, combination therapy with antiplatelets and anticoagulants was kept low (17%). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary endpoint was a composite of stroke, systemic embolism, cardiovascular or unexplained death, or major bleeding. The trial used a noninferiority design with a margin of 1.3. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I wrote in my &lt;a href="https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/www.medscape.com/viewarticle/aha-2025-mandrolas-four-trials-look-2025a1000u80___.YzJ1OndlYm1kOmM6Zzo0MjgwNmE3YTczMjVmYzBkNzM0ZmE5OWZhNWQyZjc2Nzo3OjczNWQ6YjlkZTllNDAxNDNkNzExNzIyZWFkMjRlNmM4OWMzZDRlNWM1OWJmMTdiZjE2NDQ3Zjk3NzYxZDU4ZmIyYTlkZDpwOlQ6Rg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;AHA preview column&lt;/a&gt;, the choice of this strategy had two downsides: one is that it combined both thrombotic (efficacy) and bleeding (safety) endpoints, which are expected to go in different directions and cancel each other out, thus biasing the trial toward finding no difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My second criticism of the primary endpoint is that it included CV death — which we now know from the &lt;a href="https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2101897___.YzJ1OndlYm1kOmM6Zzo0MjgwNmE3YTczMjVmYzBkNzM0ZmE5OWZhNWQyZjc2Nzo3OjkzMmM6MTI1NjczODA3Mzg0NTg4M2EyNjU1Yjg3ZDI5ZjJlNTBmZWUxNDc4YjU2YThkYzE5YjBkNzk2ZDZkYjA5MjYxNTpwOlQ6Rg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;LAAOS-3&lt;/a&gt; trial is unlikely to be affected by either treatment. Including an outcome not affected by the treatment in a primary endpoint adds noise and makes noninferiority easier to reach — as seen in another LAAC trial, &lt;a href="https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2408308___.YzJ1OndlYm1kOmM6Zzo0MjgwNmE3YTczMjVmYzBkNzM0ZmE5OWZhNWQyZjc2Nzo3OmMwNzA6MmJlNWUxNzZlZjY2ZDliNDZlYjNiNDYzMzVhOTRlN2ZhNTNmMWE5OGRlYWViYjE5YWE2Y2RhNmVmMTc5ZjlkODpwOlQ6Rg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;OPTION&lt;/a&gt;, where death was the most common event and similar in both arms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;LAAC Implantation Comes With Procedural Complications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Periprocedural complications were notable: of the 414 attempted procedures, five patients had tamponade, 18 had major bleeding requiring transfusion, there was one device embolization, one procedure-related TIA, one peripheral embolism, and two deaths within 7 days of the implant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 3 years of follow-up, the incidence of a primary outcome event occurred in 16.83 per 100 patient years in the LAAC arm vs 13.27 per 100 patient years in the best medical care arm. The adjusted hazard ratio was 1.28 with a 95% CI ranging from 1.01-1.62. This was the intention-to-treat analysis, which includes everyone assigned to a treatment arm regardless of whether they underwent their assigned treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The per-protocol analysis includes only patients who actually had their assigned treatment (ie, they got a device or they took a drug); it’s considered the &lt;a href="https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/www.nature.com/articles/s41416-022-01937-w___.YzJ1OndlYm1kOmM6Zzo0MjgwNmE3YTczMjVmYzBkNzM0ZmE5OWZhNWQyZjc2Nzo3OjdkZjY6ZTAyOGIwODVkNzVhMjBkZDcwNDQ4YWY5NzlhYTk3ZmI2YTRiNzQ3MjI1ZjhmZDg0ZmRmMGYzM2MxNmJiZWU4NjpwOlQ6Rg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;more robust&lt;/a&gt; analysis in a noninferiority trial. That hazard ratio was 1.34 and the 95% CI ranged from 1.04-1.72. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the upper bound of the 95% CI, or worst-case scenario, was much higher than the noninferiority margin of 1.3 — indicating that LAAC failed to reach noninferiority against best medical therapy. Additionally, the fact that the lower bound of the 95% CI was greater than 1.0 allows us to declare that LAAC was actually inferior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The components of the primary endpoint were interesting. Stroke and systemic embolism occurred in 30 LAAC patients vs 28 patients in the best medical care group. The incidence of major bleeding was 21% higher in the LAAC arm (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.86-1.71). CV death or unexplained death was also 25% higher in the LAAC arm (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.93-1.68). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Strong Evidence Against LAAC&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is strong evidence against left atrial appendage closure. The trial was conducted in experienced centers in Germany that were doing this procedure well before it was approved in the US. It’s also a contemporary trial; the majority of devices implanted were the latest iteration. The greater than 96% procedural success rate supports the contention that this trial environment is likely a best case scenario. CLOSURE-AF was also non-industry funded, &lt;a href="https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC332713/___.YzJ1OndlYm1kOmM6Zzo0MjgwNmE3YTczMjVmYzBkNzM0ZmE5OWZhNWQyZjc2Nzo3OjQ4MzQ6OTIwYTMyNWZjZmRjMjA0NWI1MmU2ODlkYTMwYjgxZTE5MzA3YjBjM2JhZWI0NjgwODM3ZmNhNmUyYjJiNzNiMzpwOlQ6Rg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;something to consider&lt;/a&gt; when we learn results of the coming industry funded trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet LAAC not only failed to reach noninferiority but was found inferior to best medical therapy. Worse was that it failed in an endpoint that should have been easy to succeed in — because of the inclusion of efficacy and safety components as well as CV death, which is not likely affected by either strategy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen &lt;a href="https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/x.com/benhibbertMDPhD/status/1987273311823483127?s=20___.YzJ1OndlYm1kOmM6Zzo0MjgwNmE3YTczMjVmYzBkNzM0ZmE5OWZhNWQyZjc2Nzo3OjMwNTU6ZDhjOTE3MDE0YmE0YTdiMGMxMWY4NjU1MTliYmU4YmZjYmRiMmQxYTA3OWM3OWUxOTAyODI0MjA0MTdmYzliNjpwOlQ6Rg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;some comment&lt;/a&gt; that CLOSURE-AF was underpowered, and it is only a “small” datapoint. There is some truth to that.

Yet we should not ignore important signals from CLOSURE-AF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First is the vital importance of including periprocedural events. In CLOSURE-AF, 18 of 70 major bleeding events were periprocedural. And all 18 of these required blood transfusion. The decision by &lt;a href="https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2408308___.YzJ1OndlYm1kOmM6Zzo0MjgwNmE3YTczMjVmYzBkNzM0ZmE5OWZhNWQyZjc2Nzo3OmMwNzA6MmJlNWUxNzZlZjY2ZDliNDZlYjNiNDYzMzVhOTRlN2ZhNTNmMWE5OGRlYWViYjE5YWE2Y2RhNmVmMTc5ZjlkODpwOlQ6Rg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;OPTION&lt;/a&gt; investigators to exclude periprocedural bleeding in its primary safety endpoint led to &lt;a href="https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/www.medscape.com/viewarticle/4-reasons-question-percutaneous-left-atrial-appendage-2024a1000l0u___.YzJ1OndlYm1kOmM6ZzoxZDBmZGJkZjM2NjNmNjUyMjRkOTU3ZDQyMThhN2Q4Njo3Ojk0MDQ6NjM0MmVjOGVjOWMwYmY4MDI4ZjIwNjFkZGM4OGY0MzM4ZTBmZGQ2OTZlNDNhZmQ1YTBmMTI4ZjMzZmY3OWE2OTpwOlQ6Rg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;biased conclusions &lt;/a&gt;of that trial of LAAC post-AF ablation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, while the total number of stroke events in CLOSURE-AF numbered only 58, it’s similar to the 59 ischemic stroke and systemic embolism events in the two seminal trials, &lt;a href="https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2017.10.021___.YzJ1OndlYm1kOmM6Zzo0MjgwNmE3YTczMjVmYzBkNzM0ZmE5OWZhNWQyZjc2Nzo3OjhjNWY6OGVlMDI3NGMzMzkwNGYwOWRiNDgzZTk2MmJjYmI2ZDI3MzM5NGRkYjdkZDJhMDhkYjJjYzg4OWJmMjcwYjFjNTpwOlQ6Rg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;PROTECT AF and PREVAIL&lt;/a&gt;, combined. One minor positive in CLOSURE-AF is that at least the stroke rates were not higher — as they were in PROTECT AF and PREVAIL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, major bleeding was higher in the LAAC arm. Much of it was likely driven by periprocedural bleeds, but not all of it. LAAC requires the use of antiplatelet drugs. And proponents tend to forget that antiplatelet drugs &lt;a href="https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1007432___.YzJ1OndlYm1kOmM6Zzo0MjgwNmE3YTczMjVmYzBkNzM0ZmE5OWZhNWQyZjc2Nzo3OjBmYTk6NTJmMDYyZmVhNzM5YzI4ZThjMjIyZmM4YTY0N2FlNmU1Y2M0ODYyN2E5MWZkMjRkM2YyZmM3OWY2YzAwZTFjODpwOlQ6Rg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;also cause bleeding&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lower bleeding rates in the best medical therapy arm are remarkable considering that many enrolled patients had a history of a major bleed. These patients are typically taken off their anticoagulation and referred for LAAC. CLOSURE-AF challenges that strategy. It’s notable that 10% of patients in the best medical therapy arm had no oral anticoagulation. That pragmatic feature of the trial was excellent, because in practice, no device or anticoagulant may be the best choice for such patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth, proponents might argue that the higher rates of CV/unexplained death in the LAAC arm were just noise. Maybe so; it was surely noise in PREVAIL, because the FDA mandated inspection of all deaths, and none were due to either the Watchman device or drug. CLOSURE-AF had two deaths within 7 days of the procedure; what about deaths within 30 days of the procedure? With 18 bleeds requiring transfusion, I wonder if some of the CV deaths were related to the procedure. We shall see when the paper is published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Periprocedural risk is the Achilles heel of the LAAC strategy: probabilistically, the device has to overcome the up-front risk of the procedure. Future stroke and bleeding events have to be substantially lower to overcome the initial risk a patient undertakes. In CLOSURE-AF, done in experienced labs, within the careful confines of a clinical trial, this was clearly not achieved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I conclude with a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4158865/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Bayesian&lt;/a&gt; perspective — &lt;a href="https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/x.com/kaulcsmc/status/1987270905618477143?s=20___.YzJ1OndlYm1kOmM6Zzo0MjgwNmE3YTczMjVmYzBkNzM0ZmE5OWZhNWQyZjc2Nzo3OjZiZGM6YjlkNmJlNzA5OWQzNGFlMGNiMGIzNzk0Yzc5ZGNmN2QxZDYzY2JjMzYwYjE2ZjZjNDg2YjM5NzhhM2MyNDJmNDpwOlQ6Rg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;written on X by Sanjay Kaul, MD,&lt;/a&gt; an expert in clinical trial design: PROTECT AF was rejected by the FDA; PREVAIL missed its most important noninferiority primary endpoint, &lt;a href="https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.04.067___.YzJ1OndlYm1kOmM6Zzo0MjgwNmE3YTczMjVmYzBkNzM0ZmE5OWZhNWQyZjc2Nzo3OjI0MDE6MzRlMDY0YTQyN2Y0MzgzM2E3NjVhYjBkNzFkMWJlMjZhZjdmMjhmOTY2MmRmNWIzMTc3MWNlN2NlNDNhNzJkMTpwOlQ6Rg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;PRAGUE-17&lt;/a&gt; met noninferiority for net adverse cardiac events but not for ischemic outcomes, and &lt;a href="https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2408308___.YzJ1OndlYm1kOmM6Zzo0MjgwNmE3YTczMjVmYzBkNzM0ZmE5OWZhNWQyZjc2Nzo3OmMwNzA6MmJlNWUxNzZlZjY2ZDliNDZlYjNiNDYzMzVhOTRlN2ZhNTNmMWE5OGRlYWViYjE5YWE2Y2RhNmVmMTc5ZjlkODpwOlQ6Rg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;OPTION&lt;/a&gt; did not “win” using procedural bleeding. Thus, our priors for LAAC should have been extremely pessimistic.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="195" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhpbiv6s001j3b78t7uj2i14@published"&gt;My wife and I are deeply in love and are both very affectionate. She’s in her mid-50s, I’m in my mid-60s. Just for background, she’s never had an orgasm through penetrative, manual, or oral sex, though she regularly has one with oral sex and a vibrator and dirty talk. Our problem is sort of unrelated and actually my fault. In the past, my orgasm was always triggered by my partner’s, and without her orgasm, I sometimes take a long time or don’t finish at all, and she’ll get tired and say things like, “Come on, bring it on home!” which really kills any chance of coming for me. I once made the mistake of asking if she could make some sounds of pleasure while we had sex, and she does, but they are, to be honest, pretty corny and kind of ridiculous. I’m really grateful that she’s so willing, but I also know that, post-menopause, she could pretty much take it or leave it, so I can’t bring myself to tell her maybe I shouldn’t have asked her to make those noises. Can you tell me how best to tell her it was my mistake?&lt;/p&gt;

Your wife could pretty much take it or leave it, and if she’s not coming, you’re not coming (at least for a while) so … is anyone actually having fun? Sure, it’s possible: A sex act’s worth isn’t measured in whether or not it provides an orgasm—some things are fun for fun’s sake and that’s great. But if vicarious pleasure is really what gets you off, it might be wise to focus more on what makes her come—the oral, the vibrator, the dirty talk—while at the same time masturbating yourself. (Or if she’s down, she could masturbate you and/or perform oral on you while you take care of her.) Many seem to believe that sex isn’t real unless there’s penis-in-vagina penetration and I just want to disabuse you of that notion and encourage you to seek pleasure where you find it, not according to some invented standard.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="229" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhpbivnf001n3b78o8wyyyki@published"&gt;Now, if you are determined to continue pursuing intercourse and your wife is totally down, I think it is reasonable to ask her to scale back on the theatrics. You did a great job of outlining the issue in your letter, so you’re already on your way to articulating this to your wife. You’ll want to use the softest, most affirming language possible. Start by telling her that you appreciate her putting in the effort that you requested. You can ask her how much of it is genuine—if she confesses that it’s little to none, it’s reasonable to say that you had a feeling that was the case, and that her performance actually is taking you out of it. You can ask her just how much she is enjoying herself overall during intercourse. Maybe it’s moderately so—but enough that it makes sense to keep doing it. Maybe she’s happy to keep at it because she likes facilitating your pleasure. Maybe she’d rather not and she hasn’t felt empowered enough to say that. It’s a good idea to check in and then tell her that she should feel free to express herself verbally however she sees fit—if it’s commensurate with a meh reaction to the sex at hand, so be it. This takes her off the hook and allows you to explore her experience—and ways to optimize her pleasure. Win/win.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhpbivy2001p3b78d47kzbju@published"&gt;My wife and I are both in our early 50s, and we’ve had a pretty spectacular marriage, with two problem areas: conflict and sex. I’m a born people-pleaser who’s hesitant to rock the boat, she’s the youngest of a family of fighters who takes up defensive positions pretty rapidly. We’re both pretty awkward about sex for various personal reasons and we’re both low-desire which is both helpful and problematic, since arousal never seems to line up.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="149" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhpbiw24001q3b78yjufi806@published"&gt;I spent the first part of our marriage trying to figure out how to open lines of communication between us, only for it to turn into a fight I’d retreat from. On the rare occasions she’d express a want, it would be very vague and related to things with ambiguous consent, which was very difficult for me to navigate. We fell into a pattern where we’d have something resembling fun for both of us, although she would just kind of let me drive and not really engage with me or my body. That I wasn’t getting what I’d always hoped for—a sex life where my partner and I would learn to communicate, share our needs, and take care of each other—sent me through periods of sadness and anger, but I kept it to myself and kinda boxed it up and put it away in the back of my brain.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhpbiw6e001r3b78jcearb8j@published"&gt;I came down with severe depression during the pandemic which I’ve come out of mostly, but anhedonia lingers. For reasons I don’t understand, this stuff I thought I’d put to bed has come rushing back. I’m feeling this great sense of loss and sadness, and I’ve been able to mask it so far, but I can also tell that my wife knows something is on my mind. I don’t want to lie by omission and pretend everything’s fine anymore, but I also don’t have the slightest idea how to have these conversations without it being something like, “The last 20 years of sex have sucked, I didn’t get what I wanted, wah-wah poor me.” And then even if we &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; discuss it, I still don’t actually have any desire.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhpbiwa9001s3b78nm8l2xhm@published"&gt;I’m at a loss here. In the last decade, we got diagnoses for her (autism and ADD) and me (OCD and anxiety), both of which have started to make conflict feel a little easier as we have frameworks for how each others’ brains work. In addition, I’ve never gotten over witnessing some ugly behavior from men in my childhood that left me with a lot of shame over sexual desire and guilt for asking for basically anything focused on my pleasure. Oh, and with the anhedonia, I can’t get an erection anymore (even with pills). I could really use some guidance on how to start this conversation or if you think there’s even a point to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="66" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhpbiwp8001v3b78xxzlx5cs@published"&gt;Firstly, to rebut your sign-off, it’s never too late. I don’t think this conversation is pointless, either. You really want to be able to connect and communicate with your wife. That’s an important issue whether your dick is rock hard or saggin’. You now are better equipped to deal with disagreement and there is a sense of things being unresolved. Closure might be good for you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="141" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhpbiwtl001w3b783awn0o9z@published"&gt;You can start by acknowledging what is glaring: “I know you can tell that something is up with me, and I’d like to share what it is, if you are willing to listen.” This, I realize, is a bit of a risk, as your wife could shut you down then and there. You could then emphasize how meaningful it would be to you if she would listen. If you make absolutely no headway, perhaps you could write down your thoughts in a letter that you urge her to read. You can’t &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; her hear you out, but you can certainly emphasize how important it is to you that she try. You should also consider what, if anything, actionable that you want to convey. Maybe the telling is enough but there also might be ways of fostering intimacy that you can suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhpbiwy9001x3b78b1oqd96q@published"&gt;It’s great that you’ve both been using your diagnoses to navigate communication. Keep building there. If you aren’t currently in therapy, it could help—it sounds like you have some trauma from the behavior you witnessed in childhood that you still need to work through. Also, if you haven’t talked to anyone about your anhedonia, that could also be useful. Anhedonia could have roots in physiology (a doctor may want to do blood tests to check your hormone levels, for example) and also psychology. In the latter case, sex therapy could help. Cover all your bases and visit multiple clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s like I’m back in middle school. Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhpbj6mv00273b78ja9ilwpa@published"&gt;Definitely keep hiding it. It’s worked so far and it might be the most reliable strategy here. Other methods that may work are distraction (if it is indeed possible to divert your attention from the throbbing between your legs) and, as odd as it sounds, flexing a muscle. As surgeon influencer Karan Rajan explained in &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/a38123537/unwanted-boner-doctor-explains-karan-raj/"&gt;a 2021 TikTok&lt;/a&gt;: “When you tense any muscle, especially a large one, like in your thighs, the blood from the engorged spongey tissues, the corpus cavernosum and spongiosum, will be redirected to the flexed muscle.” Plus, it’s a good method of distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

Emily Nagoski writes about this in her book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Come-You-Are-Surprising-Transform-ebook/dp/B08BZWXK9J/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.m7_pSR109gqjNNGRkyCkRA9Megg3ZxL5rzKBY_K6EhB3FgL8NS25STck1dF4sy0HUebOIPwfBZt0GgvA9af9dhw6-M_zwxFFUgKzcsJbiTP7HUeEKnid1T5dwZwgrCw-W6lf42llbUhEE_G75nDrkr1ML_bTfT507bMtxIgUi9yd6WHBsS7ZqUANLVN5REVUi75qbOhSvy__cFN8jE4jApkKuLFGRj2iE_h3zqnyVZ8.KHk99tqiv1tFUyIl9Fd_IXmhseDIzEd--3sdaQm25Kk&amp;amp;qid=1762403962&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Come As You Are&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, citing research performed by Meredith Chivers and Ellen Laan. “There is about a 50 percent overlap between what a male’s genitals respond to as ‘sexually relevant’ and what his brain responds to as ‘sexually appealing,’” Nagoski writes. That means it’s extremely common for your dick to respond to something that you think it has no business responding to. Happens! Sometimes inexplicably. One of life’s little mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;Scientists say they’ve come up with a way for the body to produce its own store of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;GLP-1 is the naturally produced hormone whose function is being mimicked by drugs like semaglutide and tirzepatide, the active ingredients in popular and highly effective weight-loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/04/health/obesity-glp1-gene-therapy-research" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, two biotech startups are working on gene therapy treatments that would require, in a best-case scenario, a single injection that would reprogram the body’s cells to produce the hormone instead of relying on weekly injections like current drugs. The idea is to coax existing cells into producing the hormone, reaping the benefits of GLP-1 drugs without ongoing treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Both companies have already shown that the approach works in mice and are already testing it on larger animals, including pigs and monkeys. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;However, whether the human body can also benefit from the approach remains to be seen. It could take years of more research to determine whether it works, let alone if it’s safe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;But the upsides could be significant. According to &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/696599/obesity-rate-declining.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;recent &lt;em&gt;Gallup&lt;/em&gt; data&lt;/a&gt;, the use of GLP-1 injectables has doubled in the United States in the last year alone. Promisingly, obesity rates have also started to decline since 2022, with experts suspicious that GLP-1 drugs have contributed to the trend.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The effects aren’t just cosmetic, either. Besides leading to weight loss, the injectables have also been shown to ward off &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/doctors-surprised-patients-semaglutide-cured-other-conditions"&gt;chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt;, help &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/glp-1-diabetes-and-weight-loss-drug-side-effects-ozempic-face-and-more" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;control blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36857807/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/ozempic-delays-aging-scientist-claims"&gt;reduce the risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/semaglutide-diabetic-kidney-disease"&gt;improve kidney health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The news comes after the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/health-medicine/trump-deal-glp1-weight-loss-drug"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; huge government-mediated discounts on GLP-1s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;This week, biotech company Fractyl presented its &lt;a href="https://planion-client-files.s3.amazonaws.com/TOS/blobs/269179c7-14eb-4d25-8546-a221f38def74/1/HANDOUT_OW_2025_Seeley_et_al_PGTx.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;latest results&lt;/a&gt; of a new gene therapy, dubbed Rejuva, finding that obese mice treated with the therapy lost roughly 20 percent of their body weight within just three weeks. Normal-weight mice also didn’t gain any weight and maintained healthy blood sugar levels after being treated and given a high-fat diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“It outperformed semaglutide,” Fractyl Health cofounder and CEO  Harith Rajagopalan told &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The approach works by using a small virus that can insert DNA instructions on how to produce GLP-1 into cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Because we are delivering it locally, we believe that we will need a very low dose of this virus, which helps gives us confidence in the potential safety in people,” Rajagopalan explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;However, experts warn that such an approach in humans would likely be irreversible and could lead to long-term issues in the pancreas, which is responsible for blood sugar control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Fractyl competitor RenBio uses a different approach, by including the DNA instructions to make GLP-1 in a saline solution, which is then injected into muscle tissue. Short electrical pulses then allow the instructions to be delivered directly into cells, effectively “using the cell’s own machinery to turn it into a protein factory,” per &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Mice injected with the solution lost roughly 15 percent of their body weight, significantly more than mice in a placebo group, and kept the weight off for at least a year. Blood sugar level regulation improved as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;While Rajagopalan hopes to see “human data in the next year,” a long road remains to a potential human treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“There’s a long way to go before you get there, and we can’t minimize the work involved,” Rajagopalan told &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;. “I mean, that’s equivalent to saying we’re going to colonize Mars, in terms of the magnitude of effort involved to get there.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“But why not aspire to aspire to that,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

In an Instagram video posted on November 9, the physician highlights creatine’s brain-boosting benefits, noting its potential to support conditions like depression and &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/study-reveals-this-activity-helps-slow-alzheimer-related-memory-loss-symptoms-101762420325051.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Alzheimer’s"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of creatine beyond muscle gains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Sood, creatine has benefits that go beyond building muscle - it can also boost brain function, supporting &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/memory" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="memory"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;, focus, and mental energy, especially when you are sleep deprived or stressed. He explains, “It works by giving your brain more fuel, helping you think clearer and learn better.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The physician points out, “While more research is needed, creatine is showing promise for brain health, memory, and even conditions like depression, Alzheimer's, and recovery from &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/brain-injury" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="brain injury"&gt;brain injury&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How to use&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sood outlines the right way to take creatine safely and effectively - “Some follow a loading phase, taking 20 to 25 grams per day for five to seven days before switching to a maintenance dose of three to five grams per day. But research shows that loading isn't necessary. Taking three to five grams daily over time is enough to increase creatine stores and get the benefits.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The physician highlights that creatine is safe and well tolerated by adults - though some may experience gut issues like &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/california-gastroenterologist-trained-at-harvard-shares-7-golden-rules-for-eating-out-to-prevent-bloating-and-discomfort-101762686451980.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="bloating"&gt;bloating &lt;/a&gt;or stomach discomfort. This can be easily managed by drinking adequate amounts of water. However, he warns, “There aren't enough studies on its long-term effects in children and adolescents. So, safety for the younger population remains unclear.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When doctors detect elevated levels of SerpinB3 in a blood test, it can signal that something is seriously wrong, from hard-to-treat cancers to severe inflammatory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         
										    


                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;SerpinB3 is a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/critical+protein/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;critical protein&lt;/a&gt; that often reveals when the body's barrier tissues, like the skin or lungs, are under serious stress from cancer or chronic illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But new research from Arizona State University shows that SerpinB3, long recognized as a disease marker, also has a natural role in the body: helping to heal wounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skin wounds remain a major challenge for medicine. Of the roughly 6 million wounds that occur annually in the U.S., many are difficult to treat and are often linked to diabetes, burns, infection or advanced age. Together, these hard-to-heal wounds cost an estimated $20 billion each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2415164122" target="_blank"&gt;In a new study&lt;/a&gt;, co-authors Jordan Yaron, Kaushal Rege and their colleagues with the Biodesign Center for Biomaterials Innovation and Translation discovered that SerpinB3 is part of the body's natural wound-healing arsenal, helping the skin recover after damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research points to new possibilities: Boosting it could improve wound healing, while blocking it may offer a way to fight aggressive cancers. The findings may also help explain SerpinB3's role in inflammatory ailments, from skin conditions to asthma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research appears in &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study grew out of a convergence of the team's broader work on &lt;a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-05-nanomaterial-quickly-wounds-diabetic-animal.html" target="_blank"&gt;bioactive materials&lt;/a&gt; for wound repair and expertise studying a family of proteins called serpins—short for serine protease inhibitors. Serpins act as important regulators of diverse processes such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+clotting/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood clotting&lt;/a&gt; and immune regulation throughout the body, with several serpins having apparent roles in keeping tissue breakdown and repair in balance.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"When we looked deeper into how our bioactive nanomaterials were helping tissue repair, SerpinB3, a protein originally implicated in cancer, jumped at us as a key factor that correlated with nanomaterial-driven &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/wound+healing/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;wound healing&lt;/a&gt;," Rege said. "This journey, which started from use-inspired research on biomaterials for tissue repair to uncovering the fundamental role of this protein as an injury-response mechanism in skin, has been truly fascinating. We are now building on this basic finding and investigating the role of SerpinB3 in other pathological conditions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rege is a professor of chemical engineering and director of the Biodesign Center for Biomaterials Innovation and Translation. Yaron is an assistant professor of chemical engineering and faculty with the center. Both investigators hold academic appointments with the School for Engineering of Matter, Transport and Energy at ASU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SerpinB3's split identity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many serpins are linked with disease when their balance in the body goes awry, showing up in inflammation, fibrosis and cancer. One member of this family, SerpinB3, has been used extensively in cancer tests as an indicator of aggressive disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SerpinB3—also known as squamous cell carcinoma antigen-1—was first discovered in cervical cancer tissue in 1977. It has long been applied as a biomarker of aggressive cancers in the lung, liver and skin, where high levels are tied to poor outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For more than four decades, SerpinB3 has been recognized as a driver of cancer growth and metastasis—so much so that it became a clinical diagnostic. Yet after all this time, its normal role in the body remained a mystery," Yaron said. "But when we looked at injured, healing skin, we found that cells moving into the wound bed were producing enormous amounts of this protein. It became clear that this is part of the machinery humans evolved to heal epithelial injuries, a process that cancer cells have learned to exploit to spread. This now opens the doors to understanding how this protein is involved in many more diseases."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;How SerpinB3 helps wounds close&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By tracking which genes switch on during healing, the researchers found that SerpinB3 levels surged in wounded skin. The increase was especially strong in wounds covered with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0142961224005027" target="_blank"&gt;advanced biomaterial dressings&lt;/a&gt;, a finding built on the group's earlier research, showing how such materials can boost the body's natural repair signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lab tests, adding extra SerpinB3 made skin cells move and cover wounds faster, working as effectively as a well-known healing booster called Epidermal Growth Factor. SerpinB3 works by activating keratinocytes—the skin cells that normally move in to repair damage. When switched on, these cells become less sticky and more mobile, allowing them to slide into the wound and rebuild tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protein also assists the body's natural repair networks, guiding healing and new tissue growth. Treated wounds showed more neatly arranged &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/collagen+fibers/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;collagen fibers&lt;/a&gt;, which act as a support structure, helping restore the skin's strength and integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implications for care&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that more work is needed to understand how SerpinB3 fits into the body's broader systems of healing. Because SerpinB3 speeds up repair, it could one day be developed as a treatment for stubborn wounds—like pressure sores and other ulcers that heal slowly over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By revealing SerpinB3's double life, the study shows how a deeper understanding of the body's own repair systems could lead to better treatments for wounds—and new strategies to fight &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Doctors have long tried to understand whether caffeine — which can increase heart rate and blood pressure — appears to trigger episodes that feel like a fluttering or thumping in the chest and cause dizziness or breathlessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cbbede" class="body-graf"&gt;“There is no standard advice for atrial fibrillation and caffeine,” said Dr. Gregory Marcus, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who led the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2841253" target="_blank"&gt;DECAF (Does Eliminating Coffee Avoid Fibrillation?) study&lt;/a&gt;. “It is very common for me to encounter patients who have stopped drinking caffeinated coffee only because their physician has told them to do so because of their atrial fibrillation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d85e00" class="body-graf"&gt;The results of the DECAF study, a four-year clinical trial examining the effects of drinking coffee in people with a history of irregular heart rhythm that had either resolved or been treated, were presented Sunday at the annual American Heart Association conference in New Orleans and published in JAMA. Marcus is an associate editor of JAMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-da5eea" class="body-graf"&gt;The researchers recruited 200 older adults in Australia, Canada and the United States who were regular coffee drinkers at some point in the last five years. The average age was 70 and one-third were women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0255ae" class="body-graf"&gt;Over six months, the participants were randomized to two groups: those who cut out caffeine, and those who had at least one cup every day. Everyone self-reported their coffee and caffeinated beverage consumption during telehealth or video check-ins that occurred one, three and six months into the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d3bbf2" class="body-graf"&gt;Using data from electrocardiograms, or ECGs, taken in a doctor’s office, wearable heart monitors and implantable cardiac devices, Marcus and his team determined if and when people in each group had their first recurrent episode of A-fib. They included episodes of atrial flutter, a related condition that also causes abnormal contractions in the upper chambers of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f7e8f9" class="body-graf"&gt;Both groups had about the same alcohol habits. Not everyone was a coffee drinker when the study began, but the number of daily coffee drinkers in each group was similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2edc89" class="body-graf"&gt;Before the study began, 60% of people in the coffee-drinking group and 65% in the no-coffee group said that coffee had never triggered an A-fib episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bde158" class="body-graf"&gt;During the six-month study, 111 people, or 56%, had a recurrent episode of atrial flutter. People in the coffee drinking group were less likely to have a recurrence — 47% compared to 64% of people in the no-coffee group — and went a longer period of time before they had their first episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2c0dea" class="body-graf"&gt;(About a third of people in the no-coffee group did admit to drinking at least a cup during the study, while the rest didn’t consume any.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-429aeb" class="body-heading"&gt;A cup a day 'perfectly safe'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8dccae" class="body-graf"&gt;It's the latest study to show coffee may lower risks of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/coffee-tea-caffeine-heart-metabolic-disease-lower-risk-rcna171354" target="_blank"&gt;heart problems and other metabolic disease&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4bac3e" class="body-graf"&gt;Previous observational research has suggested that people who drank coffee had less of a risk of A-fib, but the new trial shows a cause-and-effect relationship, said Marcus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-84288f" class="body-graf"&gt;“I was somewhat surprised at the magnitude of how protective caffeinated coffee does seem to be to prevent atrial fibrillation,” Marcus said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-649d75" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Johanna Contreras, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York, said the most significant takeaway from the study was that drinking a cup of coffee a day seems to be perfectly safe for people with A-fib, rather than that coffee is protective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-068b2b" class="body-graf"&gt;“There’s not a hard-and-fast rule. Not everyone has the same reaction to caffeine,” said Contreras, who was not involved with the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-89ff26" class="body-graf"&gt;There are notable limitations in the study, including the effects of caffeinated beverages other than coffee. The trial didn’t track differences in exercise habits or diet. People who drink coffee may also be exercising more, Marcus suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ce1486" class="body-graf"&gt;The study found that drinking just one cup of coffee per day appeared to have a protective effect, and while some people in the study did drink more than that, it’s unclear if &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/much-coffee-much-four-experts-weigh-rcna99847" target="_blank"&gt;more than a cup of coffee per day &lt;/a&gt;could have any effect on A-fib recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8dbca8" class="body-graf"&gt;Moderation is key, Contreras said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d22b87" class="body-graf"&gt;“If people are having six or seven cups of coffee, and then Red Bulls and Celsius, that’s different,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1dbcb9" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear why drinking coffee was linked with a lower risk of irregular heartbeat recurrence. It’s possible that an anti-inflammatory compound in coffee, not specifically caffeine, could have reduced recurrence in the coffee-drinking group, Marcus said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9c048e" class="body-graf"&gt;If caffeine is at play, it is possible that stimulating the body’s adrenaline response with caffeine could help stave off A-fib. People often report episodes when they are relaxed, such as while sleeping or after a big meal, when adrenaline is low, Marcus said, when the “rest and digest” part of the nervous system is activated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-689bcf" class="body-graf"&gt;Also, the trial included only people who were not currently experiencing episodes of A-fib. The findings may not translate to people with the unmanaged disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f4e87" class="body-graf"&gt;“If someone was in the midst of A-fib, caffeine could certainly increase the pulse rate during that episode and therefore lead to worse symptoms,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-755d84" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;For people who are already regular coffee drinkers, “this shows you can have a cup of coffee in the morning and be OK if you have A-fib,” Contreras said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 14:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxORXQzR0RVV1J0WFFncVJsb3ZZMm15MFhfb2FXYThUTy10ODRUQjlBUkI4ajJBbmxzTVlQRkl3SXA1OFpQTW9JeUlUOGdhd0xObnNOMmpnUlJKWHd4VVh2QTF2WGtmdDBxVDRXeWRVX0RoTFVUam1oOWNMdklOSzMwU3Zic0x3VV95RTNpTGpMR1ZKT01fRkRJbVQ4SXhIRkdKVGllcWF30gFWQVVfeXFMUFpmUmJrSXY2dmowaUVkLTJ2TmFreEt5X2V2ektrcmF0SUlmMEhNLXhjUVJkMVdZU3dJenpHYk04REt4X0dTMkMyLUd0Z2UzZjgyRFprZnc</guid></item><item><title>有希望的阿尔茨海默病预防临床试验- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/promising-clinical-trials-in-alzheimers-prevention/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I just know that my brain's not right," said Carrie Richardson, 44. "And so, I hate it. I just want it to be normal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 41, Carrie developed early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The condition is caused by rare genetic mutations that essentially guarantee a person will develop the disease. Her mother, Mary Salter, of Montgomery, Alabama, knows the toll of the disease all too well. "I've lost seven family members from the ages of 37 to 44," she said … including her son, Bryan, who died last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-small"&gt;

                  &lt;span class="embed__caption"&gt;Carrie Richardson, 44, inherited a genetic mutation that caused early-onset Alzheimer's disease. She's participating in an Alzheimer's research study at Washington University School of Medicine. &lt;/span&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mary, Carrie, and Carrie's daughter Hannah have been coming to the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis to participate in some of the world's first clinical trials in Alzheimer's prevention. "It's the least I can do to help," said Hannah. "I feel like I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Randy Bateman, who leads international clinical trials at WashU Medicine, said, "Now we have a chance to change the course of the disease in a way we've never been able to do before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason for Bateman's optimism: For the first time, there's finally success treating mild Alzheimer's with medication that removes amyloid plaques – the protein deposits that build up on the outside of nerve cells in the brain, interfering with memory and thinking. These drugs have been shown to slow cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People who had the plaques removed are 30 percent better than the people who didn't have the plaques removed," Bateman said. "It doesn't stop the dementia. Dementia still continues, but at a slower rate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point of the trials, Bateman said, is to study what happens when treatment is started even before Alzheimer's symptoms are evident: "If you look at the people who are treated in these trials, the people who are at the earlier stages, the earlier stage you go, the better off they do. Some of them actually have been stable. And so, what this suggests is that timing is critically important." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within a particular family with early-onset Alzheimer's, symptoms usually start at about the same age, so researchers can figure out when to start treatment to try to prevent the disease. "In these people, we have near-100-percent certainty they will get Alzheimer's disease dementia," Bateman said. "And we know about when they're going to get it." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though these rare mutations account for less than one percent of Alzheimer's patients, the lessons learned about when to start treatment may apply to everyone.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;"A death sentence"  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jake Heinrichs is a Broadway theater electrician from Brooklyn who carries one of the early-onset genes. The disease claimed his grandmother, uncle, father and brother, all within the same age range. "Symptoms in the 40s and, and dying in 50s," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Heinrichs growing up, the word Alzheimer's was "a death sentence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He started getting treatment in Bateman's study in 2013. Though he's definitely getting an antibody called lecanemab now, for the first seven years, he did not know if he was receiving an antibody or placebo. "I was at an age where I should have been showing signs," Heinrichs said, "and I am now at an age that I should probably not even be alive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His wife is Broadway director Rachel Chavkin. She says over the past three years, he will occasionally repeat a question, but otherwise has shown no cognitive decline since she fell in love with him twenty years ago. "Jake is now 51, which is the age that his father was when he died," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration's budget cuts have &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/scientists-fear-trump-administration-nih-cuts-could-impact-health-60-minutes-transcript/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;stopped or delayed millions of dollars in Alzheimer's research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The situation has already had an impact on Bateman's trials. "It's a precarious time," he said. "Research is not like building a building or painting a wall where you can start and then stop for a few years and then go back and resume what you were doing. It's much more like feeding a baby … if you stop doing that for a few weeks, it's irrecoverable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Let's double-down on this disease"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With federal research money threatened, philanthropist Bill Gates says the effect of decreasing investment delays any breakthrough. "The data these young researchers have to consider different ideas is so much better than even five years ago," he said. "So, this is the time where you think, wow, let's double-down on this disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's exactly what Gates is doing. The billionaire Microsoft co-founder is using his wealth and influence to bring together industry and government to tackle Alzheimer's. He's already personally invested more than $300 million. "I'm going to stay very involved in this," he said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a time of such possibility, uncertainty about funding is threatening momentum. "It's quite up in the air," Gates said. "If you talk to researchers, they're dealing with the uncertainty of, should they hire young people, or buy new equipment? And so, hopefully in the next several months, this gets resolved and, you know, that we can go full speed ahead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates has spent a considerable amount of his fortune to improve public health. And for him, it so happens Alzheimer's is personal. Bill Gates Sr., an attorney and philanthropist who died five years ago at the age of 94, also had Alzheimer's. "He was lucky enough to have 24-hour care," said Gates. "But there was no medicine, no, nothing that could bring his cognition back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates is supporting research to improve early diagnosis, treatment, and patient enrollment in trials. And – surprise – he sees a huge role for artificial intelligence. "AI is going to impact everything we do," he said. "The biology of the brain is so complex that AI's ability to take large amounts of data and find meaning in that data means that this research is going to go a lot faster."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early-onset clinical trials are expected to continue for at least another five years involving hundreds of people at 40 sites around the world. If successful, it could usher in routine screening for Alzheimer's with a simple blood test, just as we do now for high cholesterol and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could people be tested now? Bateman said, "Right now in medicine, we don't test people without symptoms, because the treatments aren't yet proven to work in people without symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding effective treatments is a hot area of research, and may include giving cocktails of medications that target not only amyloid but other possible culprits, such as brain inflammation and a damaging nerve cell protein called tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bateman said, "If this trial holds up and we can continue to demonstrate benefit year-after-year that these people are protected, then I actually think that will predict what's gonna happen in the near future in ongoing prevention trials: That they will be positive, they will work, they will give people years of dementia-free life."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Jake Heinrichs undergoes regular MRIs, physicals, memory testing, spinal taps, and PET scans to monitor his brain function, and see if he can prevent an almost-certain genetic destiny. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four-year-old Sam Heinrichs is living proof of what can come from a belief in science – and a leap of faith. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-large"&gt;

When she first pulled the pan from the oven, a thick layer of oil wriggled at the top. My brother, father and I playfully jabbed at it with our fingers, giggling as Mom rolled her eyes and scraped the oil off into the trash before dropping it on the table with an annoyed thump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As dinner started and we filled our plates, we traded glances with one another and begrudgingly took scoops of the potatoes, lifting small bites to our mouths with reservation to make Mom happy. But as we ate, Dad sat back in discomfort, lips pressed, looking down at the food he’d hardly touched. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had been signs prior ― indigestion and aches in his abdomen. That January, we had taken a family trip to Mexico, and most days he’d return to the room early to lie down. At the buffets, he’d turn up his nose, nauseated. For months his appetite would wane and he’d feel uncomfortable, but we figured it was because it was flu season, or he was traveling or something was wrong with the food. So maybe those awful potatoes were upsetting him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;One month after Easter, my dad was diagnosed with colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the year that followed, Dad stepped into his treatment with hope and resolve. He’d crack jokes with the staff that administered his chemo, forgot about the port in his chest and would walk talkative laps with us in the hospital ward when he needed stents in his kidneys. But over time, the disease gathered strength and pulled more from him. He lost weight, lost hair and, eventually, he lost faith that he would beat the cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day he was diagnosed, I had flown home from Chicago and entered into a silent pact with myself. I would never break in front of him. I wouldn’t let my fear and anger become a burden and give him more to bear. On the way home, I hid in a dirty bathroom stall, sobbing gently so no one would hear me. I nodded politely at airline attendants and hid my puffy eyes behind sunglasses. I collapsed into my mother’s arms upon arrival ― breathless, afraid my legs would give out ― and cried all the way to the hospital in an effort to exorcise my feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when we went inside and I saw Dad for the first time, I gave myself no choice but to temper the anxious fluttering in my chest. For the next year, I took solace in the shadowed corners of hospital hallways when he’d return there, symptoms flaring, but would go back to his room with a smile on my face. At home, I’d retreat to the bathroom to soothe the red gathering in my eyes or release my rage by throwing things in the basement. Then, once I’d pulled myself together, I’d sit beside him to swap jokes and tell favorite old stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author visiting her father at work.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was 10 months into his treatment when I finally broke in front of him, and he revealed the surprising yet profound truth he was using to guide his way through his diagnosis. It was a warm spring afternoon, and I sat across from Dad in the living room where the sun poured in. Our conversation moved from everyday chatter to the latest news about his treatments, his progress, the food he could still stomach and what might be next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I approached all of it ― no matter how bleak ― with optimism. I looked for a kernel of hope even where there appeared to be none. But Dad thwarted me with his steadfast practicality and the reality I couldn’t avoid. “I’m sick, dear,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt the anger swell in my throat ― attempting to manifest itself in words between the tears I’d long held back ― when I finally asked the question we often do when faced with the bleakest of circumstances: Why? Why him?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He looked back at me calmly and then said something I’ll never forget: “Why not me?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why not me. &lt;/em&gt;Three little words leveled the room and then hung there definitively, filling the space between us like a fog. Even in the thick of his suffering, he could so clearly see and accept what most people never do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why my father? Why my friend? Why my spouse? Why my child? Why do bad things happen to undeserving people?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When tragedy is personal, it feels anything but random, and we desperately try to find a reason to make it feel less so. To place blame. But Dad didn’t do anything to get cancer ― it just happened. This realization meant accepting the absolute absence of reason. Cancer ― and other terrible, unthinkable things ― doesn’t happen to everyone but can, in fact, happen to &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2015, just shy of one year after Dad was diagnosed, we lost him to colon cancer. My grief has lingered since then like a mild, disorienting fever I carry every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these last seven years, I’ve watched colon cancer gather strength. I’ve seen more headlines about how it’s upended more lives. I’ve read more disheartening facts about how more people are battling it or losing their lives to it. March is Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, and I can’t help but look back on those three words and how they offer invaluable wisdom ― and a way to put Dad’s perspective into practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the&lt;a href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/CRCFactsFigures2023" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" American Cancer Society" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69109a65e4b0853433847620" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pressroom.cancer.org/CRCFactsFigures2023" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt; American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;, colorectal cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer deaths. It’s estimated that there will be more than 150,000 new cases of colorectal cancer in the U.S. this year, and though it’s long been thought of as a disease that typically affects older people, it’s becoming&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/colon-cancer-advanced-younger-symptoms-rcna72983" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" more prevalent in people under 55" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69109a65e4b0853433847620" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/colon-cancer-advanced-younger-symptoms-rcna72983" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt; more prevalent in people under 55&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author (right) with her family at a wedding four months after her father’s colon cancer diagnosis.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though we might not have a reason for why someone gets colon cancer, we do have ways to detect it, and the earlier we do, the better the prognosis usually is.

I take constant inventory of my health, and I hope my family’s story may motivate others to do the same. I can’t say that things would have turned out differently if Dad had been screened or had seen a doctor earlier about his symptoms, but the not knowing ― the chance that he might have been saved ― is a question that will claw inside of me for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course, Dad’s realization ― “Why not me?” ― wasn’t just about his sickness, and it has taught me more than just to prioritize my health. It has also inspired me to live a fuller life. Chance invites risk, but it also invites reward. Dad reminded me to be careful when I can and where I should, but also to believe in myself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because of this, I’ve discovered I can take impassioned leaps and land somewhere I never thought possible. Whether it’s pursuing my love of writing or moving to new places, it’s helpful to remember that we don’t know what great things can happen unless we try. Dad’s words have helped me experience incredible moments and do things that I may not have otherwise done because... why not me? Why shouldn’t I reach for all of the things I want? Why shouldn’t I pursue all the things Dad would want for me ― and that he would be so happy to see me achieve if he were here? Maybe those three words were his final guiding lesson, and it’s one that has given me the strength to live a life he would be proud of. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden campaign-cta"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Tide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Has Turned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__sub-headline"&gt;Cut through the chaos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans just sent Trump a clear message — and Dems are calling it "a 5-alarm fire" for the president.

The research found that youths with higher exposure to non-abuse-related trauma exhibited distinct patterns of brain activity while performing tasks that require sustained attention and inhibition. These neural differences also varied by sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted this study to better understand how childhood trauma influences the developing brain. Prior research has linked early traumatic experiences to mental health problems later in life, such as anxiety, depression, and difficulties with attention or impulse control. However, most of these studies focus on adults or clinical populations and often include abuse as a central factor. Less is known about how trauma unrelated to abuse might affect typically developing youths, especially during adolescence, a critical time for brain maturation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Zinia Pervin and colleagues from institutions including the Mind Research Network and the University of New Mexico, wanted to explore how early trauma might affect brain activity during tasks that require sustained attention and inhibition. They were particularly interested in whether these effects varied by sex, as previous studies have shown different mental health outcomes for boys and girls exposed to trauma. The goal was to identify potential neural markers that could help flag children at risk for future difficulties with executive functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 65 typically developing children between the ages of 9 and 15. These participants were part of a larger longitudinal study known as the Developmental Chronnecto-Genomics (Dev-CoG) project. None of the children had known neurological or developmental disorders, and all were screened to ensure typical development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traumatic experiences were measured using a version of the UCLA Trauma History Profile that excluded questions about abuse, in line with institutional review board guidelines. Children were also asked to complete a symptom checklist assessing signs of anxiety, depression, and stress-related symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on their responses, participants were grouped into either a high-trauma group (more than two traumatic experiences) or a low-trauma group (two or fewer experiences). Importantly, the groups were similar in terms of age, sex, and socioeconomic status, which helped the researchers isolate the effects of trauma exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess brain activity, the children completed a task known as the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) while undergoing magnetoencephalography (MEG), a technique that records neural activity with high temporal precision. The task requires participants to press a button in response to frequent numbers (Go trials) but to withhold the response when a specific number appears (No-Go trials). This kind of task is commonly used to measure attention and inhibitory control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on neural responses in several brain regions involved in executive function, including the anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, and superior parietal cortex. They measured both the strength (amplitude) and timing (latency) of brain responses during different phases of the task. These were analyzed across three distinct time windows: early sensory processing (100–200 ms), early cognitive evaluation (200–350 ms), and later decision-making (350–550 ms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children in the high-trauma group showed reduced amplitude of brain responses in several executive function regions, particularly in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex during Go trials and the superior parietal cortex during incorrect No-Go trials. This suggests that trauma-exposed children may allocate less neural resources when engaging in attention and inhibition tasks, even when they are trying to perform correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found differences in the timing of neural responses. During early sensory processing, children with higher trauma exposure showed faster response latencies in the precentral cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this might seem beneficial, the researchers interpret it as possible evidence of hypervigilance or heightened reactivity, a feature commonly associated with stress-related conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder. These faster responses may reflect a brain that is primed to detect threats quickly, which could become problematic over time if it interferes with accurate decision-making or impulse control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional analyses revealed that trauma-related changes in brain activity varied by sex. For example, boys and girls in the high-trauma group both showed reduced amplitude in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, but the patterns of response timing differed. Males in the high-trauma group exhibited delayed responses in certain regions, while females generally showed faster reaction times during the task. These findings support the idea that trauma may affect males and females differently at the neural level, even if behavioral performance appears similar on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the researchers found no significant differences in task performance between the trauma groups. While children in the high-trauma group made slightly more errors on No-Go trials, the differences were not statistically significant. This suggests that brain-based measures may be more sensitive than behavior alone in detecting the effects of trauma during development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all research, there are some limitations. First, the participants were not clinically assessed for psychiatric conditions, so the findings cannot be directly linked to mental health diagnoses. Second, the trauma history relied on self-report and did not include detailed information about the type, severity, or timing of traumatic events. This limits the ability to explore whether specific types of trauma are more likely to affect brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also did not assess for maltreatment or abuse, which are known to have strong effects on brain development. Although this exclusion was intentional, it leaves open the question of how trauma unrelated to abuse compares to more severe forms of adversity. Finally, while the MEG technique offers precise timing information about brain activity, it cannot identify long-term structural changes. Combining MEG with other methods, such as magnetic resonance imaging, in future studies could provide a more complete picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest that future research should follow children over time to better understand how early trauma affects the brain as it develops. Longitudinal studies could help determine whether the differences observed in this study persist into adulthood or whether they are temporary changes related to ongoing maturation. Studies that include clinical assessments and broader measures of trauma could also help clarify the relationship between early stress and later mental health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2025.109263" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Neural activity is altered by childhood trauma exposure and varied by sex in typically developing youths during sustained attention-to-response tasks (SART),&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Zinia Pervin, Dathan Gleichmann, Isabel Solis, Yu-Ping Wang, Vince D.

The cardiologist pointed out a process called ‘nocturnal dipping’, which is beneficial for cardiovascular health. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Describing the process, he said, “During deep sleep, your blood pressure drops by 10-20%, giving your heart and blood vessels crucial recovery time. This ‘nocturnal dipping’ is essential for cardiovascular repair.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the common mistakes people make is staying up late. While occasionally, it is normal, consistently going to bed late can disrupt your body's internal clock. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cardiologist further elaborated the ill effects of poor sleep on the heart: “When you consistently get poor or insufficient sleep, your body remains in a state of stress, keeping blood pressure elevated, increasing inflammation, and disrupting metabolic processes that regulate blood sugar and cholesterol.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As per Dr Matta, quality sleep is a ‘cardiac medicine.’ It means that sleep can act as a natural treatment and preventive measure for cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4 simple sleep habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/09/original/sleeeppp_1762692498086.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Adhere to these safe habits to sleep well.

If your sleep quality is poor, consider paying closer attention to the pre-bedtime routine. Many stimuli can affect how well you rest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Rajesh Matta listed out these 4 habits which help you sleep better:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;1. Consistent bed and wake-up time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends, because the cardiovascular system thrives on rhythm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Comfortable sleep ambience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a cool, dark sleeping environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The bedroom should be around 18-20°C for optimal sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. No caffeine before bed&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid caffeine after 2 PM and heavy meals within three hours of bedtime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They both interfere with sleep quality and put unnecessary strain on your heart during rest hours.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. No screen time before bed&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stop screen time at least 30 minutes before bed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The blue light disrupts melatonin production.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Instead,the researchers were investigating how a known antibiotic, methylenomycin A, gets made by a soil-dwelling bacterium called &lt;em&gt;Streptomyces coelicolor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plants and microorganisms produce a host of complex compounds known as secondary metabolites, many of which happen to have useful medicinal properties in humans. Understanding how these compounds are made within these organisms and how they interact with human cells can help scientists develop effective drugs from these natural products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blueprints for producing these different biological molecules are held in specific collections of genes, called "biosynthetic gene clusters." By deleting individual genes from these clusters, Alkhalaf and Challis could remove specific enzymes involved in the synthesis of methylenomycin A. This research technique enabled them to halt the reaction sequence at key points to study it more closely — and it led them to spot extract previously unobserved intermediate compounds that get produced along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This systematic approach allowed the team to isolate two never-before-seen molecules, which they named pre-methylenomycin C and pre-methylenomycin C lactone. After using an array of techniques to thoroughly characterize the structures of these compounds, they investigated the molecules' biological activity against a panel of bacterial strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pAf9HhoDbzTZqwYvJ83wh9" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pAf9HhoDbzTZqwYvJ83wh9 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pre-methylenomycin C lactone proved particularly promising. "[It] is active against a range of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/what-s-the-difference-between-gram-positive-and-gram-negative-bacteria" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/what-s-the-difference-between-gram-positive-and-gram-negative-bacteria"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gram-positive bacteria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; (MRSA) and a multidrug-resistant strain of &lt;em&gt;Enterococcus faecium&lt;/em&gt;," Challis and Alkhalaf told Live Science. "[It] is 100x better at killing drug-resistant bacteria than the original antibiotic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps more importantly, the new compound doesn’t appear to induce antibiotic resistance in the treated strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeated exposure to antibiotics can trigger the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/how-fast-can-antibiotic-resistance-evolve" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/how-fast-can-antibiotic-resistance-evolve"&gt;&lt;u&gt;evolution of defense mechanisms in some bacteria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, eventually leading to drug resistance that makes future infections extremely difficult to treat. In a 28-day experiment, &lt;em&gt;E. faecium&lt;/em&gt; bacteria were exposed to increasing concentrations of pre-methylenomycin C lactone, providing the perfect opportunity for resistance to develop. But over that period, the team did not observe any change in the minimum inhibitory concentration — the amount of drug needed to produce a visible effect. In short, the antibiotic retained its infection-killing activity, and the bacteria did not evolve any problematic resistance mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expanding this line of research — both to include more bacterial strains and to study the drugs' effects over a longer time frame — will be two important next steps for the team to demonstrate the full potential of the new molecule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a really nice study and I think this is a lesson: if you isolate novel molecules then look for novel activities with those molecules," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofChemistryandChemicalEngineering/Study/PostgraduateResearch/find-a-phd-supervisor/dr-stephen-cochrane.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofChemistryandChemicalEngineering/Study/PostgraduateResearch/find-a-phd-supervisor/dr-stephen-cochrane.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stephen Cochrane&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a medicinal chemist at Queen's University Belfast in Ireland who was not involved with the work. However, he cautioned that there is a significant difference between a compound with antibacterial activity and an antibiotic used to treat disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big challenge is translating this into a viable drug — something that persists long enough in the body, isn't toxic to humans, and is not prone to resistance," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="d93c16b5-69fd-412f-b24a-8f31c21516d6"&gt;For Alkhalaf and Challis, this is exactly the direction they hope to pursue next. They are now collaborating with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/david-lupton/" target="_blank" data-url="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/david-lupton/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;David Lupton&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a synthetic chemist at Monash University in Australia, to develop a chemical route to pre-methylenomycin C lactone. This would enable them to produce the molecule from scratch via chemical synthesis, rather than relying on microbes to make it. In turn, this would provide larger volumes of the compound for studies aimed at understanding how the molecule works and how it might affect human cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It would be useful to identify the biological target(s) of the compound in susceptible bacteria and develop a better understanding of how changes to the compound's structure affect target binding and biological activity," Alkhalaf and Challis said. Such insight might inform the design of related compounds with even more potent antibiotic activity.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a type of depression marked by significant mood changes tied to seasons, particularly the colder months of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6ufdk"&gt;SAD symptoms can include persistent sad, anxious or “empty” moods for most of the day, feelings of hopelessness, and a loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. It can also come with decreased energy, difficulty concentrating and changes in sleep or appetite, including oversleeping. Serious symptoms include thoughts of death or suicide and even suicide attempts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="e5q55"&gt;Mental health experts say even people who aren’t suffering from clinical depression can experience dips in energy levels and mood changes because of diminished daylight, colder weather that makes it difficult to spend time outside and socialize&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="apmd0"&gt;In New York City, where many people live and work in areas where tall buildings block sunlight, people might be at higher risk of experiencing SAD symptoms, said J. Ryan Fuller, clinical psychologist and  executive director of New York Behavioral Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3j37k"&gt;“So the fall and winter months are already going to mean we're getting less sunlight exposure and skyscrapers, of course, are gonna limit even more sunlight,” he said. “In addition to that, most people in New York City work incredibly hard and incredibly long, and so they're typically going in very early, oftentimes before there's a lot of sunlight exposure, and they're leaving work very late when they're not being exposed to the sunlight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1mtt3"&gt;Molly Sherb, a psychologist at the Mount Sinai Health Center, said people tend to isolate more this time of year, and while the holidays are a joyous time for many, it can be a triggering time for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="flrnr"&gt;“ I think that it's so much easier to isolate when you're feeling cold and when it's darker out and when it's easier to just kind of go home,” she said. “ The holidays and what that triggers for people for many different reasons can, can be really tough …  There's many different reasons, not just a few actually, why people struggle with the holidays. It’s related to challenging family dynamics, it's related to grief, in terms of if this is the first or a recent holiday after someone has passed, it's related to expectations for what you were hoping would happen by this time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="ammb0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tips for SAD and seeking help&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dvosv"&gt;Fuller said depression and SAD respond well to treatment, and those experiencing symptoms should seek professional help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="653a"&gt;“ Fortunately, if someone does have a diagnosis of seasonal affective disorder, it's very responsive to cognitive behavioral therapy, so that’s one option. “It’s also very responsive to light therapy. And so it's definitely something that if you believe you might be having those symptoms, it's a good idea to go get assessed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="4ndjn"&gt;A therapist might recommend an at-home sun lamp that mimics natural daylight, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6nrik"&gt;Fuller also recommends getting as much real sunlight as possible during the colder months by going on walks outside whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="aa3lf"&gt;Sherb highlighted the importance of socializing, and said people who are struggling with isolation should make low-stakes plans to ease into seeing others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5nbtt"&gt;“ If you are someone that just goes home after work and just wants to like put sweats on and hang out at home and not really have to engage with anyone, then you're gonna have to figure out some type of plan that is a little bit more social, but close to that,” she said. “ Maybe you decide to call a friend once a week, maybe that's the first step.

   &lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD — This fall saw Pakistan's first-ever campaign to administer the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8225515/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which protects girls from cervical cancer. The vaccine is highly effective, according to global health groups, and is routinely administered in some 150 countries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was not a rousing success.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As vaccinators fanned out to schools and other sites in mid-September, they explained that the vaccine would be offered for free to girls ages 9 through 14 and could save their lives if they later contracted HPV, a common sexually transmitted infection that is a major cause of cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Pakistan, HPV is the third most common cancer, with some 5,000 cases reported annually. The yearly global death toll from the disease is approximately 300,000, with most fatalities in places where screenings and treatment are not easily accessible.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The teams, operating in parts of Pakistan as well as Pakistan-administered Kashmir, met fierce resistance from some parents.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They asked: Why is the vaccine being given only to young girls and not boys? (That's a complicated question – boys are eligible and being vaccinated could protect their future female sexual partners but because cervical cancer only affects women, the emphasis is on vaccinating girls.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They wanted to know if the vaccine would affect their daughters' ability to have children later on — and why foreign organizations such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, UNICEF and the World Health Organization were involved in the campaign. (Health experts say there's &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/groups/global-advisory-committee-on-vaccine-safety/topics/human-papillomavirus-vaccines/infertility" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;no data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to suggest that the vaccine affects fertility. The concern stemmed from videos parents had seen in WhatsApp groups with the longstanding rumor that the vaccine is a population control ploy by Western funders to sterilize Muslims.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-96605" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"We went three to four times to try to convince people," Rehana Khan Abbasi, 48, a vaccinator working in Bhara Kahu, a town on the outskirts of Islamabad, Pakistan's capital city, told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On the last official day of the two-week&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;campaign, Abbasi sat in the office of a school trying to get more parents on board. One mother, Zuleikha Bibi, remained hesitant; she'd read the fertility rumors about the HPV vaccine online. And her husband had made it clear that he would not allow their daughter to be vaccinated. "Maybe what people are saying is true, maybe not. Only God knows the truth — we do not know," Bibi said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The goal had been to vaccinate about 90% of around 13 million eligible girls. Khurram Akram, technical director at Pakistan Federal Directorate of Immunization's, estimates that the actual percentage of girls vaccinated was around 70%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Our biggest challenge was to counter misinformation," says Akram.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This community response underscores the challenge of public vaccination efforts in Pakistan, where skepticism is often fueled by social media hearsay and &lt;a href="https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.78JV7NR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;conspiracies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In Bhara Kahu,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;schools sent&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;permission forms back marked "no" before families got a chance to see them, and vaccinators were barred by school administrators from entry, said Syed Ehsan Hussain, a supervisor for the area's rural health center.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The reaction to the HPV campaign mirrors longstanding vaccine skepticism in Pakistan, which, along with neighboring Afghanistan, is one of only two countries in the world where wild polio circulates. Vaccine hesitancy has been stoked by the revelation that the CIA sponsored a vaccination drive in 2011 in its effort to uncover Osama Bin Laden as well as by misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Messaging around the HPV vaccination has been especially tricky, Hussain said, because HPV is often, though not always, spread through sex. "Whenever we bring up sexual contact again and again, it becomes sensitive due to our religious values and our society."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health officials involved in the campaign say some parents were offended by the introduction of the vaccine as they thought it suggested that their teenage girls were having sex.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pakistani officials — including the country's federal health minister, Mustafa Kamal — tried to reassure the public by arranging for public vaccination of their own daughters.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-96606" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Vaccinators also went door-to-door to address parental fears. They downplayed the sexual transmission of the virus in favor of a broader message warning women about other methods of transmission — during childbirth and through contact with contaminated objects, including in hospital delivery rooms if instruments aren't sterilized properly. This type of transmission, although possible according to some research, is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Fatima Khan, 13, was vaccinated during the campaign at her private school in Islamabad after explaining to her mother why she thought it was a good idea. "I was raised on the internet," she told NPR.

                Adil Hussain, 36, brought his daughter Ayesha, who's 10, to an HPV vaccination site in Bhara Kahu in Islamabad, Pakistan. Unlike some parents, he responded positively to the vaccine campaign.

   &lt;p&gt;Adil Hussain, a 36-year-old hotel security guard in Islamabad, also made up his mind about the vaccine after doing some research. He says when vaccinators didn't show up at his 10-year-old daughter Ayesha's school, he brought her on a Saturday to the local clinic for the shot.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He doesn't use social media, so online rumors didn't dissuade him.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He said he and his family members received other routine vaccines in the past, "and now the same is being done for our children." That's an attitude Pakistani officials hope will gain momentum in future campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Betsy Joles is a journalist based in Pakistan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He explains that they can disrupt the gut barrier and trigger inflammation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lean protein first&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gastroenterologist recommends choosing lean proteins such as grilled chicken, fish, or plant-based options instead of fried or fatty cuts. These are easier to digest and less likely to trigger acid reflux.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Light on the sauce&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi advises going easy on the sauce and requesting dressings or sauces on the side to better control portions and avoid unnecessary heaviness. He explains, “I ask for dressings and sauces on the especially creamy or buttery ones. Flavour without the digestive drama.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Don't skip the veggies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vegetables are Dr Sethi's holy grail. He highlights that steamed, roasted or even raw &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/aiims-trained-gastroenterologist-shares-8-vegetables-more-people-should-eat-as-they-fuel-gut-liver-and-overall-health-101761536226907.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="vegetables"&gt;vegetables &lt;/a&gt;are non-negotiable as they provide plenty of fibres that fuel gut microbes. However, he recommends skipping fried veggies since they can trigger bloating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Smart carbs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gastroenterologist recommends opting for smart carbohydrates that do not cause bloating and are gentler on the gut. According to him, “Plain rice, quinoa, or baked potatoes keep things simple. I pass on buttery mashed or cheesy sides that weigh me down.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mind the drink&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fizzy drinks, whether regular or diet, can trigger bloating and discomfort. Dr Sethi suggests opting for water or soothing &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/8-best-herbal-teas-to-boost-immunity-and-support-overall-wellness-during-seasonal-changes-101760420344468.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="herbal teas"&gt;herbal teas&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Dessert done right&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi suggests skipping the sugar-loaded desserts because they result in sharp blood sugar spikes. Instead, he suggests choosing fruit-based desserts such as berries or sorbets - they satisfy your sweet tooth while keeping blood sugar levels comparatively steady.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

While it’s true that these are certainly symptoms of dementia and Alzheimer’s (the most common form of dementia), missing some of the more subtle signs that aren’t as well-known can lead to a later diagnosis and delay in care. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="an estimated 6.7 million Americans over the age of 65" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="690cc915e4b027afb3225b8c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;an estimated 6.7 million Americans over the age of 65&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the U.S. living with Alzheimer’s, dementia is far from rare. So, what dementia-related signs should someone look out for in themselves and others? And when should they see their doctor for a dementia screening? Here’s everything you need to know: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The biggest early sign is spatial issues along with trouble with speech and directions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While we all forget a word now and then, if this becomes a pattern, it could signal a problem. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Difficulty with language including word-finding difficulty, incorrect sentence construction or difficulty with self-expression can present well before the loss of memory,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.delraymedicalctr.com/find-a-doctor/detail/arif-dalvi-1659422632" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Arif Dalvi" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="690cc915e4b027afb3225b8c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.delraymedicalctr.com/find-a-doctor/detail/arif-dalvi-1659422632" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Arif Dalvi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a&lt;span&gt; neurologist and physician chief of the Movement Disorders Program at Delray Medical Center.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to brush this off, but it’s important to monitor if there’s any frequency with this behavior. Additionally, you may notice a change in your sense of direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Visual or spatial skills can also be affected early,” Dalvi continued. “A common way this presents is difficulty navigating a previously familiar route or needing GPS directions to a route that was previously known.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay attention to other red flags as well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other less commonly recognized symptoms include difficulty completing familiar tasks, noise sensitivity and a change in taste and smell, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/doctor/stanley-appel/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Stanley Appel" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="690cc915e4b027afb3225b8c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/doctor/stanley-appel/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Stanley Appel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, neurologist and d&lt;span&gt;irector of the Ann Kimball &amp;amp; John W. Johnson Center for Cellular Therapeutics at Houston Methodist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An abrupt change in personality or mood without underlying explanation should also raise a red flag,” Dalvi added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, more rarely, you might see some symptoms that resemble other neurological issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Some types of dementia, such as Lewy body dementia, can cause hallucinations or delusions,” Appel explained. “It’s crucial to note that hallucinations can also result from other causes, and any unusual symptoms should be discussed with a health care provider.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring up any concerning symptoms to your doctor ASAP.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, there is no cure for dementia. But both experts emphasized that an early diagnosis can improve quality of life and stop the disease from progressing as quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Traditional treatment options, such as medication to manage symptoms, recommendations for lifestyle changes and referrals to support services like occupational and speech therapy are vital in maintaining cognitive function and overall well-being,” Appel said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plus, in recent years, there has been a significant breakthrough in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The FDA has approved two new drugs, Aduhelm (aducanumab) and Leqembi (lecanemab), that target the buildup of amyloid beta plaques in the brain, which is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease,” Appel said. “Although the approval of Aduhelm has been controversial, some studies have shown that it can slow cognitive decline in certain patients. On the other hand, clinical trials have shown that Leqembi can slow cognitive decline in certain patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to lessening the build-up of amyloid plaques, Appel added that some doctors are working on other innovative approaches to treatment. One is to suppress neuroinflammation with regulatory T-cells (Tregs), and other investigations are using advances in gene therapy to develop novel approaches for Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“These breakthroughs in medical science offer hope for individuals with dementia and their families,” he said. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is no “official” age to get a dementia screening, but it’s always a good idea to reach out to your doctor if you’re experiencing any symptoms. Dalvi emphasized that since the incidence of dementia rises with age, particularly after 65, that’s a good time to have a simple dementia screening such as a mini cognitive assessment. Physicians can look for reversible causes of memory loss, like a vitamin B12 deficiency or hypothyroidism. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Screening for hearing loss at this age is also important as it is estimated that 1 out of 9 dementias can be explained on the basis of age-related hearing loss,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While there may not be a complete cure for dementia and Alzheimer’s, there is a lot doctors can do once they reach a diagnosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There should be no stigma associated with screening for dementia,” Appel said. “An early and accurate diagnosis allows a plan to be put in place for either treating or slowing the cause of dementia.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 12:00:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxQUnJYcmhuQjNBU1liaGxMam9iZC1NSXJPQzZGQjctZXRVUzVTaXB6TW1IQmdZWlpUcVc1QWhkbHdwNEFER1d1NTMzaHNxRUJ3dTJicTZKZ0NyaExNS1VBZWJDXzVDSk41V1BTUklTS0V0bWloV0dQX3dPRzRDYUtSbC1Ta2hPbWVHNkMtZ0JSb9IBlAFBVV95cUxPX2xocUVydE5kTGQxaWNGWk1MLU92SUNWZWpUSXpQdE5rS21CcFRKek1qQlQxNWhLZDI4Zk5UTmVmOWtJamxNd2p6SHRYQmNsUjVzbnlzZ1RVbEtnMGZBME1FM1FzSHp2aUpJcHcydGVDZW11X3kwbnBwYWg1ZzkxSzBhckRIX05senZfR0QxczhJZnB6</guid></item><item><title>当你吃红薯时，你的血糖会发生什么- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-sweet-potatoes-for-blood-sugar-11845616</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

We interviewed an endocrinologist and a diabetes dietitian to share how sweet potatoes &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/17387/5-tips-to-keep-your-blood-sugar-in-check/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;impact blood sugars&lt;/a&gt; and a few blood sugar–friendly ways to eat them.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no avoiding the fact that sweet potatoes will raise your blood sugar. “Sweet potatoes are a starchy vegetable, so physiologically their carbohydrates naturally raise post-meal glucose,” says &lt;a href="https://dupagedietitians.com/our-team" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Deepa Deshmukh, M.P.H., RDN, CDCES, BC-ADM&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t let that scare you away, though. Even if you have prediabetes or diabetes, you still need carbs for energy, and experiencing a rise in blood sugars is natural after eating.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You just want to avoid a large, rapid spike in blood sugars. A big spike is more likely to happen if you top your sweet potatoes with sweets like sugar or marshmallows. Instead, add toppings rich in protein and fiber like beans, ground meat and nonstarchy veggies.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Sweet potatoes contain dietary fiber, which has great benefits for your gastrointestinal system and can help with absorbing glucose, slowing digestion and reducing blood sugar level elevations after eating,” says Pessah-Pollack. A medium sweet potato has about 4 grams of fiber—14% of the Daily Value—and 24 grams of total carbohydrates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Their fiber, including pectin and resistant starch, slows gastric emptying and carbohydrate absorption, helping blunt the spike compared with lower-fiber starches,” adds Deshmukh. This rich fiber content makes sweet potatoes an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/carbs-to-eat-every-week-11787950" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;excellent carb choice&lt;/a&gt; for better blood sugars.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As far as starchy veggies go, sweet potatoes are especially &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-resistant-starch-11749332" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high in resistant starch&lt;/a&gt;—a fiber that resists digestion in the small intestine and makes it to your colon intact.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; There, it gets fermented by microorganisms, which produces short-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids help reduce inflammation and support glucose metabolism.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Studies have found that including resistant starch in meals leads to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-daily-habits-diabetes-management-11792897" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower post-meal blood sugars&lt;/a&gt; in people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber is the most important component of sweet potatoes for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/simple-ways-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check-11791785" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;preventing blood sugar spikes&lt;/a&gt;, and most of the fiber comes from the skin. “Leave the skin on for extra fiber (and potentially less of an increase in blood sugar),” says Pessah-Pollack. By eating the skin, you’ll reap more of the blood sugar–stabilizing benefits of sweet potatoes’ fiber and resistant starch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To manage diabetes, the American Diabetes Association recommends filling half your plate with nonstarchy veggies, one-quarter with protein, and one-quarter with carbs or starches like sweet potatoes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  This is also a balanced plate for people without diabetes. When assembling a meal with sweet potatoes, add a source of protein and plenty of nonstarchy veggies. This ensures you have a balance of carbs, protein and fiber for optimal blood sugar regulation. Lean proteins like chicken and salmon can be great choices for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7939797/the-top-mediterranean-foods-for-better-blood-sugars/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart health and balancing blood sugars&lt;/a&gt;. Beans and lentils provide both fiber and protein, while nonstarchy veggies like broccoli, cauliflower, greens and mushrooms add fiber and nutrients without a bunch of carbs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although sweet potatoes are undeniably delicious topped with marshmallows and brown sugar, these toppings are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-added-sugars-11694001" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sources of added sugars&lt;/a&gt;. “Skip the sugar and marshmallows if you have diabetes or issues with sugar levels to prevent glucose spikes from these toppings,” recommends Pessah-Pollack. These toppings have a higher glycemic index, so they’re more likely to spike your blood sugars. If you do use sweet toppings, try reducing the amount you use, and pair it with sources of protein and fiber.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Letting your sweet potatoes cool before eating them is a simple way to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290850/diabetes-myths-that-dont-lower-blood-sugar/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;mitigate blood sugar spikes&lt;/a&gt;. “Cook–cool–reheat is believed to increase resistant starch, further moderating glucose rise,” says Deshmukh.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You can enjoy them cold in salads or reheat them after you’ve let them cool.

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add them to salads. &lt;/strong&gt;Toss cooled, cubed sweet potatoes in your salads—like this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/277650/sweet-potato-kale-chicken-salad-with-peanut-dressing/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sweet Potato, Kale &amp;amp; Chicken Salad with Peanut Dressing&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make loaded sweet potatoes. &lt;/strong&gt;There’s something comforting about a loaded potato. Not just that, but loading up your sweet potato provides an opportunity to add protein and nonstarchy veggies for better blood sugar regulation. For inspiration, check out this diabetes-friendly &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/275785/chicken-curry-stuffed-sweet-potatoes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Chicken Curry Stuffed Sweet Potatoes&lt;/a&gt; recipe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use them in grain bowls. &lt;/strong&gt;Toss cubed sweet potatoes in your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chickpea-sweet-potato-grain-bowls-8703855" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;grain bowl&lt;/a&gt; for a source of carbohydrates and fiber. Bonus for blood sugars if you let them cool first! Split the carbs between sweet potatoes and a whole grain like quinoa. Then top the grains with proteins like chicken, salmon or tofu, and nonstarchy veggies like avocado, broccoli and kale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiment with different varieties.&lt;/strong&gt; While you may be most familiar with orange sweet potatoes, there are lots of varieties to enjoy. “Explore purple, orange and Japanese white varieties for different textures, polyphenols, vitamins and antioxidants,” says Deshmukh.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Experts agree—sweet potatoes are an excellent carb choice when it comes to balancing blood sugars. “While we know that sweet potatoes can raise sugar levels as they are carbohydrates, the overall beneficial effect of the dietary fiber in sweet potatoes can help with glucose levels and improve blood sugar control,” says Pessah-Pollack. To prevent blood sugar spikes, be sure to leave the skin on and pair sweet potatoes with lean protein and nonstarchy veggies. This ensures you’ll get plenty of protein and fiber to slow carbohydrate absorption.

The researchers observed alterations in brain network function and identified changes in molecular pathways linked to neuroplasticity, metabolism, inflammation, and stress-related hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers designed this study to explore how different mind-body techniques, when practiced together in an immersive setting, affect the human body and brain. Although each of these techniques—meditation, placebo rituals, and cognitive reconceptualization—has previously been studied on its own, their combined effect on biological and neurological systems had not been examined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We started to collaborate with Joe Dispenza about five years ago exploring the mind body connection. The retreat setting he offers provides a unique experimental setting to study a number of subjects and apply numerous ways to look at effects on the mind and body. This work is independently funded by InnerScience Research Fund and aims to explore to connection between mind and body,” said study author Hemal H. Patel, a professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine and research career scientist at the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers selected 20 healthy adult volunteers from a pool of 561 individuals who had expressed interest in participating in a study during a week-long mind-body retreat. These individuals were randomly chosen to represent a mix of prior experience with meditation. Eleven of them had been regularly practicing the specific meditation techniques for at least six months, while the remaining nine were new to the approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retreat itself lasted seven days and was designed to be immersive and structured. It combined three core components: daily lectures, intensive guided meditations, and group healing rituals. Participants attended approximately 25 hours of lectures throughout the week. These presentations emphasized the idea that the mind plays an active role in shaping bodily experiences and that perception and belief can influence physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meditation sessions totaled 33 hours and followed a guided format with music and vocal instruction. These sessions were grounded in a form of contemplative practice similar to Kundalini meditation. Participants were guided to direct their awareness inward, focusing on breathing patterns and perceived energy centers located along the body’s midline, such as the chest, throat, and forehead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These practices aimed to reduce cognitive activity related to judgment or self-referential thought and to create a state of present-centered awareness. The instructions often encouraged participants to imagine themselves moving beyond ordinary concepts of space and time and to remain in a receptive, open state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The healing rituals comprised about five hours and were conducted in small groups. In these sessions, six to eight participants surrounded one individual designated as the “healee.” The others acted as “healers,” engaging in practices that involved focusing their attention on their heart and hands while maintaining a compassionate mental state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although no specific biological mechanism was presented to explain how healing might occur, participants were told that the ritual could potentially benefit either the healer or the healee. Importantly, all participants knew that no medical treatment was being administered. This transparency aligns the ritual with an open-label placebo framework, in which positive effects are sought without deception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants underwent brain scans before and after the retreat using functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI. During the scans, participants either rested or followed a guided meditation. The researchers looked at changes in connectivity among different brain networks, especially those linked to self-related thoughts, attention, and emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the retreat, meditation was associated with reduced activity within two key brain networks: the default mode network and the salience network. These networks are often active during internal reflection and emotional monitoring. Meditation also led to decreased whole-brain modularity, which suggests that the brain was operating in a more integrated, less compartmentalized way during this state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also found increases in global efficiency, a measure of how effectively the brain can transfer information across different regions. These results imply that the participants’ brains became more interconnected and flexible after the intervention, especially during meditation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a more detailed level, certain regions such as the insula and prefrontal cortex showed decreased communication, while new connections emerged, including between the insula and the posterior cingulate cortex—regions previously linked to immersive and altered states of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We noticed in advanced meditators that a specific region of their brain had more volume (was bigger), an unexpected finding that we are following up on,” Patel told PsyPost, adding that he ws also surprised by “the fact that the brain at the end of a week-long retreat look similar to what a brain would look like on psychedelic compounds like psilocybin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The unique conclusion here is that we do not need to turn outside to change but have a powerful, endogenous ability to affect change by making new chemicals We are further exploring this as well but have evidence in this paper that individual elevated levels of endogenous opioids that likely create the pain mitigation effects. We suspect many other endogenous compounds (which we typically take exogenous drugs to modulate) are also likely elevated after such an intensive experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond brain activity, the researchers examined a wide range of biological markers in blood plasma. They analyzed proteins, metabolites, and small RNA molecules associated with gene regulation. They also conducted cell-based experiments to assess whether blood samples taken after the retreat could influence nerve cell growth or energy production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one experiment, cultured nerve-like cells treated with post-retreat plasma showed greater neurite outgrowth—a sign of enhanced neuroplasticity—compared to cells treated with pre-retreat plasma. This was accompanied by increases in proteins linked to the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway, which supports neuron survival and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also observed metabolic changes. Cells exposed to post-retreat plasma showed a shift toward glycolysis, a faster form of energy production that occurs in the absence of oxygen. This shift was reflected in higher levels of glycolysis-related proteins in the participants’ plasma after the retreat. These findings suggest that the body’s energy systems may have become more responsive or efficient following the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plasma samples also revealed increased expression of both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory proteins, which may reflect a process of cellular renewal or repair. While inflammation is typically viewed as harmful, a controlled increase can support healing and immune function. The simultaneous upregulation of both types of markers suggests that the body was engaged in active regulation rather than a chronic stress response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another notable change involved the endogenous opioid system, which regulates pain, mood, and reward. The researchers measured increases in opioid-related peptides, including beta-endorphin and dynorphin, after the retreat. These molecules are known to promote feelings of well-being and are typically activated during placebo responses or physical exercise. That such changes occurred without deception or medication points to the potential of open-label placebo techniques to trigger these systems through belief and engagement alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The metabolomic analysis of the blood samples also showed changes in molecules related to neurotransmitter function, especially those involved in tryptophan and phenylalanine metabolism. These pathways influence serotonin and dopamine, two neurotransmitters involved in mood regulation, motivation, and cognitive function. Shifts in these molecules suggest that the retreat may have altered the chemical balance related to mental and emotional states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at tiny vesicles in the blood called exosomes, which carry genetic material and signaling molecules between cells. They found that the content of these exosomes changed after the retreat, especially microRNAs involved in synaptic transmission and metabolism. Some of these genetic changes appeared to affect pathways linked to neurotransmitter release and energy processing, providing another line of evidence that the mind-body practices influenced communication between cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand which of these biological features were most influential, the team applied machine learning techniques. They found that the strongest predictors of change included specific metabolites, connectivity patterns between brain networks, and proteins involved in energy and immune regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our data suggest that the mind is a powerful tool for affecting change, and this can be accomplished in a short period (7 days) through a targeted approach that teaches individuals new concepts, incorporates deep meditative practices, and includes intention-based exercises to support health and resilience,” Patel said. “What is even more profound is that when the mind changes from a functional perspective, the body dramatically changes to form anew to become more resilient from many perspectives (i.e., energy, inflammation, pain mitigation, neuronal plasticity, and molecular and biochemical shifts). Ultimately the mind and body are connected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study shows that our minds and bodies are deeply interconnected — what we believe, how we focus our attention, and the practices we participate in can leave measurable fingerprints on our biology,” added first author Alex Jinich-Diamant, a doctoral student in the Departments of Cognitive Science and Anesthesiology at UC San Diego. “It’s an exciting step toward understanding how conscious experience and physical health are intertwined, and how we might harness that connection to promote well-being in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the breadth of findings, the researchers caution that the study has limitations. It did not include a control group, which means that changes cannot be definitively linked to the retreat activities. Participants may have been influenced by factors such as diet, sleep, social interaction, or simply being removed from daily stressors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample size was relatively small, and many participants were experienced meditators, which may limit the generalizability of the results. Additionally, while the changes observed were statistically significant, it remains unclear how long they persist or whether they translate into lasting health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The sample size was limited to 20 individual due to getting individual through the fMRI scanner in the time we have available,” Patel noted. “However, connecting changes in the brain with deep profiling of changes in the blood lead to a unique observation that the retreat setting provides a powerful tool to affect profound change in individual very rapidly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings may help lay the groundwork for future research on how intentional mental practices can influence physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a number of manuscripts we are working on that span many different areas in to explore the mind-body connection,” Patel explained. “We are looking at the full spectrum of things that can be collected from individual in a relative non-invasive way to see how mind truly impact body form the blood to the microbiome, to human physiology. The power to do this at large scale, in thousands of individuals, in upcoming manuscripts allows us to explore to impact of this intervention on health as well as individual suffering from 50+ different diseases. We are very excited by what we are uncovering and hope that this information will help guide development of new ways to enhance human health and resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-09088-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Neural and molecular changes during a mind-body reconceptualization, meditation, and open label placebo healing intervention&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Alex Jinich-Diamant, Sierra Simpson, Juan P.

			&lt;p&gt;Listening to music into old age could reduce the risk of dementia by almost 40 percent, a new study has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's based on data from 10,893 Australians aged 70 or older, who, at the time of recruitment, were living in retirement communities and had no diagnosis of dementia. They were asked about their music listening habits and whether they played an instrument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-a-surprising-link-between-music-and-brain-health"&gt;There's a Surprising Link Between Music And Brain Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Folks who "always" listened to music (as opposed to never, rarely, or sometimes listeners) were 39 percent less likely to develop dementia after at least three years of follow-up, and were 17 percent less likely to develop &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_impairment"&gt;milder forms&lt;/a&gt; of cognitive impairments. They also performed better on tests of general cognition and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/neuroscientists-find-two-types-of-brain-cells-that-help-us-make-memories"&gt;episodic memory&lt;/a&gt;, which is important for recalling everyday events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who were regularly picking up an instrument to &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; music were 35 percent less likely to develop dementia, but, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2019.1699019"&gt;unlike in other studies&lt;/a&gt;, there was no significant improvement for other kinds of cognitive impairments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who both listened to and played music had a 33 percent reduced dementia risk, and a 22 percent reduced risk for unrelated cognitive impairments. Education level seemed to play a role, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Music engagement benefits were strongest in those with higher education (16+ years) but showed inconsistent results in the middle education group (12–15 years)," the study's authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/gps.70163"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper's lead author, public health researcher Emma Jaffa from Monash University in Australia, &lt;a href="https://newshub.medianet.com.au/2025/10/music-can-stave-off-dementia-by-up-to-40-per-cent-monash-study-finds/126069/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; these results suggest&lt;span&gt; "music activities may be an accessible strategy for maintaining cognitive health in older adults, though causation cannot be established."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While we don't know for sure if listening to music can really stave off dementia, hearing loss is a known risk factor for dementia, and research shows hearing aids &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/landmark-trial-suggests-hearing-aids-help-reduce-cognitive-decline"&gt;can reduce cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. So it can't hurt to keep your favorite tunes on rotation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Listening to music activates a whole range of regions across your brain," Monash University neuropsychiatric epidemiologist and senior author Joanne Ryan &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-10-30/listening-to-music-can-delay-onset-of-dementia/105950280"&gt;&lt;span&gt;explained&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in a radio interview, "and so that's really giving you that cognitive stimulation, which is beneficial to help reduce your risk of dementia." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/gps.70163"&gt;International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This can potentially lead to feelings of guilt or encourage restriction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The photo logging and ingredient breakdown are definitely useful and can increase awareness of patterns," adds Ti.

For instance, when I took a photo of my half-eaten oatmeal, it was able to detect within seconds that it contained oatmeal, banana, peanut butter and chia seeds. I added that it also had pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and hemp seeds, and adjusted the amounts accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't always sure of the exact amount of certain ingredients in my food -- which would be the case when eating out, something I didn't do when testing the app -- so I didn't put a ton of weight on the numerical food score my meals received. Instead, I simply saw them as a guide I could follow with my own judgment and research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="b8967e0e-9492-4350-81d2-c73c0cbe13b5" data-ng-block="{"&gt;AskZiggie AI chatbot: I asked it about carbs, diabetes and more&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently in beta, the Zoe app comes equipped with a Google Gemini-powered AI nutrition coach named Ziggie.

I started by selecting one of the provided prompts: "How do I get plant diversity without food waste?" Ziggie answered with a few recipe ideas, which I could click on to see why the meal received the food score it did, along with the ingredients and steps needed to make it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a test, I asked, "Do I have diabetes?" Ziggie answered by saying it couldn't provide medical advice or diagnoses and that I should consult my doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My next question was, "Are carbs bad?" It answered by citing Zoe's research, which found that not all carbs are created equal, an answer &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow sponsored" data-id="824dd39b-19f8-4563-af2d-f7ffc90405ad" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/15416-carbohydrates" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;supported by the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Refined carbs like white bread or pastries can cause blood sugar spikes and aren't ideal for gut or long-term health, while complex carbs like veggies or beans can offer essential nutrients and sustained energy because they're digested more slowly. Ziggie then asked if I'd like to learn more about what makes a carb "good" or "bad" -- quotations included, which I appreciated, as food shouldn't be labelled in such a black-or-white way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_adLeftRail stickyAd sticky-ad-check c-adDisplay_container_native-mpu-middle blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-medium c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption c-shortcodeImage-pullLeft"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer when I asked Ziggie if carbs are bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Zoe/Anna Gragert/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ti also likes that Ziggie provided factual information on how refined and complex carbs differ, especially in terms of their physiological response. However, she does wish that it mentioned that foods are not inherently "good" or "bad." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to avoid slipping into that moral binary (black and white perspective), which can often trigger and reinforce restrictive thought patterns," Ti explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the AskZiggie chatbot could be helpful for asking general questions about nutrition, but like with all AI chatbots, I'd advise you to fact-check its answers and consult your doctor before making any changes to your diet or routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_adLeftRail stickyAd sticky-ad-check c-adDisplay_container_native-mpu-middle blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="5e882cb5-de16-444d-8889-fb5aaa2c808e" data-ng-block="{"&gt;The processed food risk scale: Are all ultra-processed foods bad?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The food risk scale allows you to scan labels and barcodes to view a score that details how a food's composition and processing may impact your diet and overall health. According to Amati, this tool aims to advance the conversation about ultra-processed foods, as the &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow sponsored" data-id="ef0bf94c-821f-45b0-a180-660899d7dc71" href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/news-center/practice-trends/examining-the-nova-food-classification-system-and-healthfulness-of-ultra-processed-foods" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Nova food classification system&lt;/a&gt;, which categorizes foods into four groups based on their level of processing, is more than 15 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In some of the research that's been done on ultra-processed foods, they're not all the same. Some of them can actually be a healthy part of the diet, while others should be avoided," says Amati. "So we took a step back and thought about how we can better classify processed foods in a way that's relevant to human health outcomes and not just the level of processing, because level of processing isn't always a good reflection of the healthfulness of the food."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-medium c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Extra Creamy Original Oatmilk's high-risk note on the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Zoe/Anna Gragert/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led to the creation of the risk scale, which has four classifications from no risk to high risk. In addition to the level of processing, and based on clinical trial data, the scale considers the features of processed foods that have the most significant impact on health outcomes. This includes energy intake rate and hyperpalatability, which can contribute to overconsumption, as well as the &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/say-goodbye-to-red-dye-no-3-and-hello-to-fda-approved-natural-food-dyes/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;use of additives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Amati emphasizes that the food risk scale doesn't penalize all additives, but rather considers the impact of having multiple additives present in a product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_adLeftRail stickyAd sticky-ad-check c-adDisplay_container_native-mpu-middle blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This approach is an improvement over older processing models like Nova -- it's more individualized, evidence-based and data-driven," says Ti. "I like that they recognize that 'processing' alone doesn't always predict a food's health impact (e.g., frozen veggies are technically processed)." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Ti believes that labeling foods using a risk scale could be problematic, as it introduces a hierarchy and assigns morality. "For someone trying to repair their relationship with food, seeing 'high risk' attached to something they enjoy can trigger shame, guilt or restriction," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoe was able to build the US database for this tool in large part thanks to crowdsourcing, where Americans scanned products to contribute to the database. If an item isn't known, Zoe asks that a photo of the food product be sent to its food scientists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="e5a5bf54-5ee5-4389-bbf2-5a094944d6ca" data-ng-block="{"&gt;My experience with the risk scale&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot has been written about the pros and cons of using &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/tech/services-and-software/can-ai-help-you-decode-food-labels-and-cosmetic-ingredients-heres-what-this-app-offers/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;apps that rate your food with a score&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, especially considering that, because every app has its own methodology, you'll get different ratings from each one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Zoe, when you scan a barcode, you get a score you can click on for Ziggie's AI assessment, a list of ingredients that you can edit, the nutrition facts and more information about the scoring system itself. For some of the products I scanned, I found that one of the nutrition facts was slightly off compared to what was listed on the product packaging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a corn masa, refried bean and cheese Amy's burrito I had for a quick lunch was reported as having 32 grams of carbs on Zoe while the packaging said 38 grams. I wasn't able to adjust these numbers on the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-medium c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoe's nutrition facts versus Amy's for the Southwestern burrito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Zoe/Amy's/Anna Gragert/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the only product I scanned that was labelled "high risk" was the Planet Oat milk. Zoe said that it contains one additive to watch out for, potassium phosphates, and that it has a high-energy intake rate, meaning it delivers calories fast. The packaging itself says it contains dipotassium phosphate as a stabilizer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_adLeftRail stickyAd sticky-ad-check c-adDisplay_container_native-mpu-middle blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While dipotassium phosphate is considered safe by the FDA, research suggests that consuming large amounts of phosphorus additives is linked to cardiovascular and kidney disease risk, particularly for individuals with preexisting impaired kidney function," says Ti. "Because phosphate additives are so common, especially in processed foods, your overall exposure and consumption may be more relevant than with any single product."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I asked Ziggie about potassium phosphates being high risk, it said that Zoe's science highlights that highly processed foods, which often contain additives like phosphates, can be detrimental to our health because they're hyperpalatable and can lead to overconsumption. As a result, Ziggie recommended that we limit our consumption of these foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I found the processed food risk scale to be a good foundation for my own research. For instance, I will now be purchasing a different brand of plant-based milk. I don't think it's helpful to label foods as "good" or "bad," so I do like that there's some nuance with the scale and how it simply tells you to "watch out for" certain ingredients, but I don't think it should be seen as the final word on your diet. After all, a healthy diet is all about balance, and moderation of (not completely eliminating or demonizing) certain foods is key. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I do think that people with a history of disordered eating could be triggered by this feature. Ti agrees.

The more beans you collect, the further along you get on the winding yellow path present on the Zoe app's home tab. It's essentially gamifying healthy, more mindful eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-medium c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The winding yellow path where you collect beans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Zoe/Anna Gragert/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to beans, you can also accumulate avocados to unlock content, including quizzes and further information on topics such as mindful eating, gut bacteria and calorie myths. For example, did you know that your gut microbiome helps your body fight infections and protects you from disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="d6b96cbc-1a89-450d-ae05-0d92ee50323f" data-ng-block="{"&gt;My experience collecting beans&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I didn't benefit from this feature, and it can't be turned off; however, someone who finds gamification motivating for healthy eating might enjoy it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="3979a15b-ade7-40db-bdf9-026ddd1c54cd" data-ng-block="{"&gt;The diet score&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Diet tab on the app, you can view your diet score, which represents the quality of your diet from the previous day. It's based on all the meals you logged, focusing on plant diversity, &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/is-fibermaxxing-new-protein-goals-asked-nutrition-experts/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;fiber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, processed foods and fat sources. You can also connect your Apple Health app to Zoe, allowing the steps and sleep data collected by your wearable device to be considered. I didn't do the latter and solely focused on logging certain foods I wanted to learn more about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of the daily readiness (aka how prepared your body is to take on the day) and sleep scores offered by wearables like the &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/tech/mobile/oura-ring-4-review-my-favorite-wellness-tracker-comes-with-a-pricey-caveat/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Oura Ring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. According to Zoe, this score aims to help you understand how your eating habits can support your health, guiding you to make more mindful food choices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="26b4aef1-a0c4-4b73-b8fe-0de02e555025" data-ng-block="{"&gt;My diet score experience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because I didn't log all my meals with the app and instead focused on specific foods and products I wanted to see the nutrition facts for, I didn't put a lot of stock into this score. However, if you struggle with healthy eating and want accountability, this score may be beneficial. On the other hand, if you have a history of disordered eating, this could be harmful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-medium c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption c-shortcodeImage-pullLeft"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the diet score page looks like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Zoe/Anna Gragert/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the diet score could increase awareness around patterns and help some stay mindful, it also places judgment on eating patterns. For those learning to eat intuitively or recovering from disordered eating, seeing a 'low diet score' might trigger guilt or restriction," says Ti. "Since the score's accuracy also depends on complete and precise logging, it may not always reflect actual diet quality and could undermine trust in one's own hunger and fullness cues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4013c422-9792-4d7d-872c-1003fc65146c" data-ng-block="{" data-id="4013c422-9792-4d7d-872c-1003fc65146c"&gt;Who isn't the Zoe app right for?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I asked Amati about who the Zoe app might not be right for, she mentioned people with complex dietary needs that require support from a specialist, such as those with chronic kidney disease or people with a history of disordered eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think tracking in general isn't helpful for a lot of people who [cope with] disordered eating, so it's not just us, but anything that pushes you to track," says Amati. "We have worked with specialist dietitians to make sure that our app is very positive and that it essentially minimizes any risk of being detrimental. But we are very open to the fact that we haven't been designed with disordered eating in mind as a primary focus point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ti adds that this app may not be right for pregnant or breastfeeding individuals, because metabolic and nutrient needs shift significantly during pregnancy and lactation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="479f0f31-a07a-4e21-a995-0cdd88a8fa50" data-ng-block="{" data-id="479f0f31-a07a-4e21-a995-0cdd88a8fa50"&gt;How much does the Zoe app cost?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who's always looking to save money where I can, price is typically the first thing I consider when evaluating any product, service or app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is the free Zoe app and the ad-free Zoe Plus, which costs $100 per year or $16 per month. The Plus version offers personalized scores to help you make better food choices and allows you to upload your &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/medical/blood-tests-tell-how-body-functioning/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;blood tests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. I've been testing the Plus version, which the company has allowed me to use at no cost; however, I didn't provide my blood test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, the app required members to obtain Zoe's membership and undergo a gut health test, which involved wearing a &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/medical/best-continuous-glucose-monitors-according-to-experts/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;continuous glucose monitor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (CGM) for up to 14 days and collecting one-time blood and stool samples. This membership and test are currently sold out, as the new testing experience and app are scheduled to launch by the end of 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5bb3d517-c21b-4429-89ce-72fb63c69b50" data-ng-block="{" data-id="5bb3d517-c21b-4429-89ce-72fb63c69b50"&gt;My final thoughts on the Zoe app&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I appreciate that the Zoe app consolidates multiple features in one place, but the ones I've benefited from the most are the AI photo logger and the processed food risk scale. I enjoyed taking a photo of a meal or food product to quickly get a general idea of its nutrition facts and healthfulness. The AskZiggie AI nutrition coach -- which I'm glad is evidence-based -- was also helpful in giving an overview of why the food received the score it did. I was then able to use this information to conduct my own research and learn more about the foods I'm eating, as well as how I can be more mindful of my diet in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gamification aspect and diet score weren't helpful for me but if you're someone who could benefit from healthy eating accountability, you might have a different experience. As a result, I would stick with the free version of the app. Use caution if you have a history of disordered eating or are concerned about how these numbers may trigger you. If you're unsure, consult your health provider before using the app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_adLeftRail_bottom c-adDisplay_container_mpu-bottom blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I enjoyed certain features on the Zoe app but felt others weren't useful. I subscribe to the notion that knowledge is power, especially with the food we put into our bodies and this app helped guide me in making informed decisions about my food choices. However, balance is equally important and if you feel that tracking and scoring your food will disrupt a balanced approach to eating, then this app and others like it may not be the key to unlock your healthy eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 10:47:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxOeTlXX0dmYWdZOThoZExzZWJabHQtMzJzbEhxaU95MloyZ1JWNF9udXZ4bGtvTm9oWEgzZ3dlNE1CekZYVGZGMkpTS3hqRUFZYlJYLXBnT01BVXl2WWdyM1NsTzZFdDJLcFFBTzlFS1pfbnNpRzdacWxQdVlucVk1bktzRGl1ZFNSdDdQLXp3WGFGcDBub1dBTVlRX0pMNnBXdUNzZWRtOHNXUUFKOHVwcjN3</guid></item><item><title>为什么尿路感染会不断复发？原因可能不是公共厕所，但身体里有一件事-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/why-do-utis-keep-coming-back-the-reason-may-not-be-public-toilets-but-this-one-thing-in-the-body/articleshow/125198500.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urinary tract infections can indeed be triggered by poor hygiene or public toilets, but that’s only half the story. What if the real reason UTIs keep coming back is hiding inside your body? This hidden cause could be the key to finally breaking the cycle of repeated infections. Well, it’s not just bacteria hitting back. Recurring UTIs may reflect not just repeated exposure, but low immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What counts as a 'recurrent' &lt;keyword id="44807" type="General" weightage="100" keywordseo="UTI" source="Orion"&gt;UTI&lt;/keyword&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urinary tract infection is defined as ‘recurrent’ when two or more acute UTIs happen within 6 months or three or more within 12 months, as per &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557479/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;NIH guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. The guidelines suggest that it’s a very common issue, and after the occurrence of one UTI, there are 25–50% chance of a recurrence. In 80% of the cases UTIs are caused by bacterium Escherichia coli. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low immunity is increasingly recognized as one of the predisposing factors that keeps bringing back UTIs. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs): What causes recurrent UTIs and how to manage it by Dr Prathima Reddy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How low immunity triggers &lt;keyword id="21647961" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="recurrent-UTIs" source="keywords"&gt;recurrent UTIs&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The urinary tract isn’t just a passive channel for urine, it has its own immune defenses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2025.1540149/full" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research in Frontiers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; shows that when these local defenses are weakened or dysregulated, bacteria can sneak in, hide, and multiply, often forming intracellular reservoirs that lead to repeated infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ics.org/2020/abstract/597" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Clinical studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; highlight measurable differences in immune function among those with recurrent UTIs.

She had a cough that simply wouldn't go away, but didn't think anything of it, since, as a mother of two, she was used to getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Around Christmas that year, she found herself constantly bringing lozenges around to help quell her cough. But still, her symptoms never subsided. Then, in February 2024, she became even more congested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I was having a very bad cold, and it became worse with extreme lung congestion and fatigue," she tells PEOPLE. "I started to wheeze. I thought, 'This cold really got worse. Maybe I have pneumonia.' "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She went to urgent care, and they took an X-ray, noticing cloudiness in her lungs, agreeing it was likely pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"They gave me a shot of antibiotics and steroids, and told me if I didn't feel remarkably better to come back in a few days," she recalls. "I was prescribed inhalers, and three days passed, and then I went back to urgent care because I didn't get any better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Quintana, 43, still experienced the same symptoms, and the X-ray revealed no improvement in her lungs. So, the technician recommended that she consult a pulmonologist, a doctor who specializes in the respiratory system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heather Quintana &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heather Quintana&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In late March, she scheduled a visit with her primary doctor and got a CT scan that showed nodules in her lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Later that same week, she saw a pulmonologist and told him about her symptoms. He reviewed her CT scan and asked if she wanted to try a different medication or undergo a bronchoscopy to sample a nodule in her lungs and test it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Quintana says she was "tired of guessing" and decided to get the bronchoscopy, a procedure that allows doctors to look at the lungs and air passages by inserting a thin tube through the nose or mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I go through the bronchoscopy, they pull the sample, I wake up and the doctor's there," she recalls. "He says it was cancerous."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, they needed to get a better look at where the cancer was, so her doctor referred her to a local oncologist, who ordered a PET scan in April 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The results come in on a Sunday afternoon when there's nobody to call. The PET scan results say that I have cancer in my lungs, I have cancer in my liver and I have cancer in my lymph nodes," she shares. "I have cancer everywhere. I could not believe what I was reading."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heather Quintana &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heather Quintana&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Quintana was scared and looking for answers. In a conversation with her husband, she told him to remarry if something were to happen to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I said, 'I have cancer and I have cancer everywhere.' We had a good cry that day and freaked out. I assumed that I was done," Quintana confesses, noting that her husband's sister had died from breast cancer at 36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"For me to tell my husband that I had cancer was the worst thing he could ever hear," she says. "I took it as a motivator because I need to prove that this outcome can be different. I really set it as a goal with my husband, I said, 'We're gonna have a different outcome here. Don't think I'm gonna end up the same.' "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She tried calling her oncologist when she got her results, but was told her doctor was on vacation for the next two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Instead of breaking down and crying, I said, 'I need immediate help, and this is not the doctor for me,'" she shares. "I called my friends and colleagues and told them I had cancer. I work in the music industry, and many of the clients I work with are affiliated with cancer charities or cancer support groups. I called the people I knew who were helpers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It turned out that one of her coworkers had a connection at the local hospital, City of Hope, where she found care within a week through her connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heather Quintana &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heather Quintana&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Through a thoracic surgeon at City of Hope, Quintana was introduced to the head of lung oncology, &lt;a href="https://people.com/doctor-family-followed-him-to-hospital-to-help-treat-patients-after-evacuating-8773053" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Ravi Salgia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Ravi Salgia&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Salgia reviewed Quintana's test results and discovered that she had a genetic mutation, which leads to uncontrolled cell growth. What seemed like lingering cold symptoms turned out to be Stage 4 EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) — an advanced form of lung cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, which is noncurable, but treatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With this information, Dr. Salgia got to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"He said, 'We're gonna put you on a treatment plan and throw the whole kitchen sink at this thing. Are you with me?' And I said, 'Yes, I am with you,'" she recalls, noting that he put her on "a targeted therapy" that had recently been FDA-approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"He said, 'You're gonna be on Rybrevant, a targeted therapy. We're also gonna give you pemetrexed, a lung chemo, and carboplatin, which is more of a general chemo that attacks everything,'" she says. "He said, 'I want to be swift, and will drive as hard as you want to drive.' I said, 'Let's drive.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Quintana also needed to undergo radiation "to clean up the cancer" in her bones, and started the very next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She stayed at the City of Hope for almost eight days, during which she walked around the radiation department and met the radiologist and the entire team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I felt very supported, and they cared so much about me. That day, they told me I have stage 4 lung cancer. That was impossible to hear. We all thought that meant that you were going to die," she admits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Very quickly after speaking with City of Hope, they informed me that it's no longer the case. That these cancers can be treated, you have to maintain it and stay on a regimen, and they can keep the cancer at bay and keep it away," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Salgia advised her not to rely on "Dr. Google." His focus was on treating her as an individual and patient, not as a statistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The regimen ended up being that, first of all, they put radiation on my hip, my neck and my brain," she shares. "It took about a week or two to hit all of those spots. Then they gave me a couple of weeks to rest. Then I started a regimen, which was six times a month of carboplatin, Rybrevant and pemetrexed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I am on maintenance, they call it a maintenance treatment," she adds. "I do that about once a month, every four weeks. I get scanned all the time, which I am grateful for. I want them to, to make sure that everything is good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Quintana says that, after the first six treatments, she "knew it worked."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The cancer kept shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and shrinking," she tells PEOPLE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Part of her advice to others echoes what her doctor told her, which is "don't trust Dr. Google."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Find a healthcare provider that you feel comfortable with. You need to be able to trust your care team and know that they're providing you with the best possible medication regimen. Don't accept anything less."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While still in continuous treatment, Quintana leans on the help of others and continues to share her story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"That was something hard for me to explain to people, is that right now I can't tie a neat little bow on this story that I'm cured and wave the flag of mission accomplished, but I can live a very normal life," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I can continue to do that for decades and hope that as long as I hang in there, a cure could be found. I take it a day at a time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/mom-thought-stage-4-lung-cancer-was-a-cold-exclusive-11843911" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News UK</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9odG5BbHNuT09oclE2S1FHTGhWRF9LVEtYd1JQUWVXd2dfOGhNWGItOVRzY2FScjNxNUZSNVVVdEpjWFp1WUhtZmV5Z0RIZkhVRUdUNkJYa2NGSHBUTkVRUFlGZWFZdDM4eEhMQTZKMkRIY2s</guid></item><item><title>牙釉质再生：科学家发现突破性凝胶可预防更强的牙齿和蛀牙-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/regrowing-tooth-enamel-scientists-discover-breakthrough-gel-for-stronger-teeth-and-cavity-prevention/articleshow/125199799.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a world where cavities could be reversed instead of being drilled and filled. That possibility is now closer than ever. According to a&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-54785-y" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; 2024 study published in Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, scientists have developed a glycerol-stabilised calcium phosphate gel capable of repairing early enamel damage by mimicking the tooth’s natural mineralisation process. This discovery represents a breakthrough in preventive dentistry. Though still in development, experts believe it could mark a shift from repairing cavities to regenerating enamel naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why &lt;keyword id="30428490" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="regrowing-tooth-enamel" source="keywords"&gt;regrowing tooth enamel&lt;/keyword&gt; matters for &lt;keyword id="20101956" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="oral-health" source="keywords"&gt;oral health&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tooth enamel is the strongest material in the human body, yet it cannot regrow once lost. This thin, protective outer layer shields the teeth from acids, bacteria, and wear. When enamel erodes, the inner dentine becomes exposed, causing sensitivity and increasing the risk of decay. Current dental care focuses on patching damaged areas with fillings or crowns, but these are artificial replacements, not true restoration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nature Communications study explains how scientists aimed to replicate enamel’s natural growth process. Their glycerol-stabilised calcium phosphate (CaP) clusters form a nanoscale coating that can merge seamlessly with existing enamel. This new layer mimics the hardness and composition of natural tooth enamel, effectively rebuilding lost mineral density. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research could fundamentally change the approach to oral health by treating early-stage decay before it requires invasive procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How the new enamel-regrowing gel works&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology is based on biomimicry, meaning it imitates the natural biological process of enamel formation. During tooth development, cells called ameloblasts secrete proteins that guide calcium and phosphate ions to crystallise into enamel. Once teeth erupt, ameloblasts are lost, making regeneration impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers overcame this by developing a glycerol-stabilised calcium phosphate cluster, a material that mimics enamel’s crystalline structure. When applied to a demineralised tooth surface, these clusters bind tightly and rapidly form a protective coating. In controlled lab tests, the gel successfully repaired early-stage enamel erosion within hours, demonstrating mechanical strength and acid resistance comparable to healthy enamel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this particularly impressive is that the gel integrates with the tooth surface rather than sitting on top of it. This could make it a non-invasive, self-healing treatment for minor cavities and erosion, something no toothpaste or mouthwash can achieve alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Key benefits of regrowing tooth enamel with calcium phosphate gel&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If clinical trials confirm its safety and effectiveness, this new gel could transform how dentists manage oral health. The potential benefits include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Early &lt;keyword id="26143070" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="cavity-prevention" source="keywords"&gt;cavity prevention&lt;/keyword&gt;: The gel could halt tooth decay before it progresses, reducing the need for drilling and fillings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduced tooth sensitivity: By sealing exposed dentine, enamel regrowth may naturally relieve discomfort caused by temperature or acids.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long-lasting protection: The new enamel layer closely matches the hardness and resilience of the natural one, improving durability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Accessible preventive care: Applied by dentists or potentially in at-home treatments, it could make enamel protection easier for everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these outcomes suggest a future where dental damage can be repaired before it becomes irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What limitations remain before enamel regrowth becomes available&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the promising results, the Nature Communications research is still in its experimental phase. The gel has shown success in laboratory and simulated oral environments, but human clinical trials are still needed. Scientists must confirm how well it performs under real-life conditions like chewing, saliva exposure, and bacterial activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another challenge is scalability. Producing stable, medical-grade calcium phosphate clusters that retain effectiveness over time is complex and costly. It may take several years before the product reaches dental clinics. Researchers are now exploring ways to optimise its composition and shelf life to ensure consistent results in everyday use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The future of dentistry with enamel regrowth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If successfully commercialised, tooth enamel regrowth technology could mark a major turning point in dental care. Instead of filling cavities, dentists could focus on biological repair and regeneration, preserving the tooth’s natural structure. Preventive treatments might become as simple as a topical application during a check-up, making oral care less invasive and more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, maintaining enamel health remains essential. Brushing twice a day with fluoride toothpaste, flossing regularly, avoiding acidic foods, and scheduling routine dental visits are still the best defences against enamel erosion. This new discovery adds hope, not replacement, to those habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of regrowing tooth enamel was once science fiction, but it is now on the verge of becoming science fact.

But recent research suggests that it may also serve an unexpected purpose, relieving constipation. Constipation, a common digestive issue affecting millions worldwide, has long been linked to factors such as poor hydration, low fibre intake, and sedentary behaviour. Yet scientists are now exploring how coffee and its caffeine content may help stimulate bowel movements naturally. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38167025/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in BMC Public Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; revealed a significant association between higher caffeine intake and lower odds of constipation, shedding light on coffee’s lesser-known impact on gut motility and microbiota balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why caffeine makes you poop: How your morning coffee keeps digestion moving&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine acts as a natural stimulant, not just for the brain but also for the digestive system. Once ingested, it triggers contractions in the colon, known as peristalsis, which help move stool through the intestines. Researchers have found that caffeinated coffee produces a stronger colonic response than water or decaffeinated coffee, supporting its role in promoting bowel activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the BMC Public Health study, adults with higher caffeine intake showed 20–40 per cent lower odds of constipation than those consuming minimal amounts. The researchers analysed over 13,000 participants and found that moderate to high caffeine intake (roughly the equivalent of one to three cups of coffee a day) was associated with more regular bowel movements, particularly among young and middle-aged adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The underlying mechanism appears to go beyond caffeine’s stimulating effect. Some studies indicate that compounds in coffee, including chlorogenic acids, may influence the gut microbiota, the community of bacteria crucial for digestion and nutrient absorption. By promoting microbial diversity and supporting beneficial bacteria, coffee could indirectly aid in maintaining healthy intestinal movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why only caffeinated coffee makes you poop, not decaf&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One striking finding from the BMC Public Health analysis was that caffeinated coffee had a measurable effect on constipation relief, while decaffeinated coffee did not. This suggests that caffeine itself, rather than other coffee compounds, is the primary driver of the digestive response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments measuring colon contractions, participants who consumed caffeinated coffee showed increased motor activity within minutes, similar to the effect of a meal. This rapid stimulation of the colon helps trigger the gastrocolic reflex, the natural wave of muscular contractions that encourages bowel movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decaffeinated coffee, although rich in antioxidants, lacks this stimulant effect. However, both caffeinated and decaffeinated varieties can still support digestive health when consumed as part of a balanced diet, especially when paired with adequate hydration and fibre intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why coffee’s poop-boosting power fades with age&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study found that coffee’s constipation-relieving effect was strongest in younger and middle-aged adults but less pronounced among older adults. Age-related changes in gut motility, medication use, and lower caffeine metabolism may explain these differences. Older adults often experience slower digestive movement and may require a combination of dietary adjustments, hydration, and light physical activity alongside coffee to experience similar benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While caffeine consumption can enhance colonic motility, excessive intake can cause discomfort, jitters, or dehydration, factors that might worsen constipation in sensitive individuals. Therefore, balance and moderation remain key, particularly for older populations or those with underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The right way to drink coffee for better digestion&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee’s gut-stimulating effect is real, but it depends on how and when you consume it. Health experts emphasise that timing, preparation, and moderation can influence whether coffee supports or disrupts digestive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to make the most of coffee’s natural laxative effect:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep consumption moderate. One to two cups of coffee a day, providing around 100–200 milligrams of caffeine, are usually sufficient to stimulate healthy bowel movement without side effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time it right. Drinking coffee in the morning or soon after meals helps activate the gastrocolic reflex, promoting natural bowel contractions. Avoid coffee on an empty stomach to reduce the risk of acidity or discomfort.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hydrate well. Caffeine has mild diuretic properties, so pair every cup with water to prevent dehydration and maintain stool softness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid heavy add-ins. Cream, sugar, or high-fat milk can slow digestion. Opt for black coffee or a small amount of low-fat milk for the best results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose wisely. Filtered or cold-brew coffee is gentler on the stomach. Strong espresso or unfiltered brews can be harsher and should be consumed in smaller amounts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Know your limits. Those sensitive to caffeine or on medication that affects gut motility should consult a healthcare professional before increasing intake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alternate caffeine days. Skipping coffee occasionally can prevent tolerance and sustain its gut-stimulating effect over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beyond caffeine: What else could be helping&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between coffee and digestive health might extend beyond caffeine alone. Polyphenols and other plant compounds in coffee act as prebiotics, subtly reshaping the gut microbiome in favour of beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli. These microbes play a crucial role in producing short-chain fatty acids, which enhance intestinal movement and help maintain softer stool consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies have also shown that caffeine can restore disrupted gut microbial balance and improve levels of butyrate, a compound essential for colon health. Together, these findings suggest that coffee’s effect on constipation is multifaceted, involving both muscle stimulation and microbiome modulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A natural, science-backed way to stay regular&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While coffee is no substitute for a fibre-rich diet, hydration, and physical activity, emerging research supports its role as a mild, natural aid for constipation. By enhancing colonic motility and supporting microbial diversity, caffeinated coffee offers a surprisingly simple addition to digestive wellness. As scientists continue to explore the gut–brain connection, your morning brew might just be doing more than waking you up; it could be keeping your digestive system in motion, one cup at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

&lt;p&gt;That’s the message after some scary-sounding reports about a preliminary study involving the sleep-related supplement. It raised questions about the safety of long term use of melatonin for insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors have long known that too little or interrupted sleep raises the risk of heart disease. But heart experts say this kind of so-called observational study can’t prove that melatonin use plays any role — instead of the insomnia patients were trying to treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We should not raise the alarm and tell patients to stop taking all their melatonin,” said Dr. Pratik Sandesara, an interventional cardiologist at Emory Healthcare who wasn’t involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our bodies naturally produce melatonin, a hormone that regulates our sleep cycles. Levels normally increase as it gets darker in the evening, triggering drowsiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People may take lab-produced melatonin to help them fall asleep or to adjust for jet lag or time changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study used international electronic health records, tracking adults diagnosed with insomnia who had a melatonin prescription that suggested they used the supplement for at least a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over five years, 4.6% of the chronic melatonin users developed heart failure compared to 2.7% of insomnia patients whose charts showed no melatonin use, the researchers found. The study is being presented at an American Heart Association meeting but hasn’t undergone peer review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But only certain countries require a melatonin prescription. It’s over-the-counter in the U.S., meaning Americans in the study might have used the supplements without it being recorded, said Northwestern University cardiology chief Dr. Clyde Yancy, who wasn’t involved in the study. The study also did not show dosages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, U.S. supplements don’t require government approval, meaning brands can vary in their ingredients. The researchers, from SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, characterized the findings as a call for more research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, patients wondering about melatonin should talk it over with their doctors, said Emory’s Sandesara. Generally doctors recommend it for short-term use, like for jet lag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yancy noted that while the study doesn’t prove there’s a danger from long term melatonin use, there’s also no evidence that people should use melatonin indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one key to better shut-eye is to practice better sleep hygiene, like making sure your room is dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we expose ourselves to blue light in particular at night, we are diminishing our melatonin levels. That’s science,” he said. Sleep problems aren’t about “just being sleepy and tired — they’re putting yourself at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;

If only those cells are removed at that time, the disease gets eradicated from its roots with almost 100% success.”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here are the 4 cancer screenings he suggested:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Mammography&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mammography for breast cancer should be done once by the age of 40, advised the oncologist. He stressed, “Annual mammograms are often recommended every year, but most people don't need them every year. Even once every two years is enough.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Cervical cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Sharma, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer. “The Pap smear is a very effective test for this. A Pap smear can detect cancer at stage zero,” he explained. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/09/original/cancer_tests_1762663283392.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="4 necessary tests to detect cancer early.

(Google Gemini)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Stool test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the oncologist recommended doing a stool test for stomach cancer. He explained, “The first sign of cancer inside the stomach is bleeding from somewhere. A stool test can detect blood.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Chest CT scan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, according to the oncologist Dr Sharma, those who smoke a lot and have been smoking for a long time should get a chest CT done because they have a chance of getting lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stay informed.
