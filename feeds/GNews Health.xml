													MEASURES. WE’RE GOING TO TURN TO FIVE ON YOUR HEALTH RIGHT NOW, AND MORE AMERICANS ARE FACING A NEW DANGER AFTER DARK. RESEARCHERS ARE NOW PREDICTING THAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM SLEEP APNEA COULD DOUBLE BY THE END OF THE CENTURY. JOINING ME RIGHT NOW IS DOCTOR FAMILIAR FACE. WCVB CHANNEL 5. GOOD TO SEE YOU. TODD CHAIR OF MEDICINE AT SOUTH SHORE HEALTH. SO LET’S LET’S START WITH THIS CONDITION. OKAY. ABOUT ABOUT 30 MILLION PEOPLE. IT’S A SIZABLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE IT, BUT ONLY 6 MILLION ARE ACTUALLY DIAGNOSED. WHAT MAKES THIS SO HARD TO SPOT? RIGHT I THINK IT’S IMPORTANT. SO 80% OF PEOPLE WITH SLEEP APNEA DON’T KNOW THAT THEY HAVE IT. WHY? FIRST OF ALL, SOME PEOPLE SLEEP ALONE. OBVIOUSLY THEY DON’T HAVE A PARTNER THAT CAN RECOGNIZE YOU’RE STOPPING BREATHING, YOU’RE SNORING SO MUCH. THAT’S ONE REASON. YOU KNOW, ANOTHER REASON IS THAT TO REALLY FORMALLY DIAGNOSE IT, YOU NEED A SLEEP STUDY. NOW, THERE ARE WEARABLE DEVICES THAT ARE MAKING IT EASIER TO SPOT, BUT YOU STILL NEED THAT SLEEP STUDY. AND SOME PEOPLE, SOME OF US THINK WE’RE NOT SLEEPING A LOT, AND WE MAY WEAR IT AS A BADGE OF HONOR. WE’RE WORKING HARD, BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS, IF YOU’RE NOT SLEEPING WELL, IF YOU WAKE UP EARLY IN THE MORNING WITH HEADACHES OR WHAT WE CALL DAYTIME SOMNOLENCE WHERE YOU’RE SLEEPING MORE THAN YOU SHOULD DURING THE DAY, YOU KNOW, THINK ABOUT IT. SO SO YOU HAVE READ THIS, THIS STUDY, RIGHT? SO WHAT’S THE LINK TO IS THERE A LINK TO GLOBAL WARMING? RIGHT. THIS WAS A STUDY PUBLISHED IN NATURE COMMUNICATION. LOOKED AT OVER 100,000 PEOPLE KIND OF RETROSPECTIVELY, AND SHOWED THAT IN THE PARTS OF THE WORLD, THIS WAS A GLOBAL STUDY. AND THE PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT WERE THE HOTTEST, THERE WAS A 45% INCREASE IN OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA. 45. THAT’S RIGHT. AND SO IT JUST SHOWS THAT WE KNOW THAT HOT WEATHER DISRUPTS OUR SLEEP CYCLE. IT LEADS TO SHALLOWER BREATHING. IT LEADS TO MORE FREQUENT AWAKENING. AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT REALLY IMPAIRS OUR ABILITY. YOU KNOW, OUR AIRWAY ABILITY. SO OUR RESEARCHERS IN THIS STUDY OFFERING ANY SOLUTIONS THERE ARE. REMEMBER, IF YOU’RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO LIVE IN A PLACE WHERE THERE’S AIR CONDITIONING, THAT HELPS. BUT MAKING THE DIAGNOSIS IS SO IMPORTANT. THAT’S WHY I WANT TO TELL YOU AT SOUTH SHORE HEALTH, WE HAVE AN UNBELIEVABLE SLEEP CENTER. WE DO 2000 THIS YEAR. WE’RE PROBABLY ON TRACK TO DO 3000 SLEEP STUDIES PER YEAR. OKAY. IT’S RUN BY A NEUROLOGIST, JAMIE JOHNSTON. SHE’S A WONDERFUL MEDICAL DIRECTOR. IT’S IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BRIGHAM. AND I JUST THINK I WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE, IF YOU HAVE ANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS, GO AND TRY TO GET A FORMAL DIAGNOSIS. BUT IT’S A COMMITMENT. IT’S AN INVESTMENT. IT’S A WORTHY INVESTMENT. REMEMBER, YOU MAY HAVE THE REASON YOU’RE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE IS REFRACTORY TO MEDS. COULD BE SLEEP APNEA. COULD BE OBESITY, CAN BE LINKED TO SLEEP APNEA, WORSENING DIABETES. A LOT OF THESE THINGS, YOU KNOW, IT IMPAIRS OUR ABILITY TO DRIVE MORE ACCIDENTS. SO THERE’S LOTS OF BENEFITS. WOW. ALL THOSE ALL THO

And, when you go to Italy, or even read about going to Italy, it does make you wonder. They eat cookies for breakfast. Lunch and dinner are typically multicourse meals, with a pasta or risotto as a first course and a meat dish as a second. There are sometimes antipasti as well. Even &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34067077/" target="_blank"&gt;schoolkids&lt;/a&gt; often get multicourse meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZFUUSGLTNZET5GK7L5DMJP75BM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And the foods! Charcuterie! Cheese! Ravioli! Pizza! Focaccia! Gelato! On its face, it doesn’t seem like a recipe for avoiding weight gain. Yet, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#country/106" target="_blank"&gt;U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization&lt;/a&gt;, the obesity rate among Italian adults was 17 percent in 2022. In the &lt;a href="https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#country/231" target="_blank"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, it was 42 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VOD6OX7AR5DYDKPW2R3PCZYPXA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Because I know you come here for hard-nosed empiricism, let’s take a look at what we know about the differences in Italian and American diets. But don’t expect it to tell us much. Countrywide data is a blunt-force instrument: Many other things vary from country to country, and data is often collected in different ways. Still, let’s set the stage. (Unless otherwise noted, the data is from the FAO.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="T2UFQYFWRBHDVARCP74XKOFVB4" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Italians &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/fish-and-seafood-consumption-per-capita?tab=chart&amp;amp;country=ESP~CHN~BGD~GBR~GRC~ZAF~IND~ITA~USA" target="_blank"&gt;eat more fish&lt;/a&gt; than Americans do, 64 pounds per person per year to Americans’ 49 pounds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They drink &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/alcohol-consumption" target="_blank"&gt;quite a bit less alcohol&lt;/a&gt; overall, according to data from the World Health Organization. To account for differences in the alcoholic content of beer, wine and spirits, the numbers are expressed as pure alcohol: 1.9 gallons worth per year for Italians vs. 2.6 gallons for Americans. But they drink more &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/wine-consumption-per-capita?tab=chart&amp;amp;country=ITA~USA" target="_blank"&gt;wine&lt;/a&gt;: enough to contain 1.1 gallons of pure alcohol for Italians, 0.4  gallons for us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the International Pasta Organization  (and really, it should know), &lt;a href="https://internationalpasta.org/annual-report/" target="_blank"&gt;Italians&lt;/a&gt; eat more pasta (51.2 pounds per person per year) than anyone on Earth. At &lt;a href="https://internationalpasta.org/news/wpd-2024-in-philadelphia-how-pasta-won-the-hearts-of-americans/" target="_blank"&gt;19.4 pounds&lt;/a&gt;, Americans don’t hold a candle to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even though vegetables are a vaunted part of the Mediterranean diet, Italians &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/vegetable-consumption-per-capita?tab=chart&amp;amp;country=IDN~WSM~KAZ~ITA~USA" target="_blank"&gt;don’t eat more vegetables &lt;/a&gt;than Americans do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Italians do, however, eat much less meat. Americans eat &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-meat-type?country=USA~PRT~JPN~OWID_WRL~ESP~DEU~ITA" target="_blank"&gt;67 percent more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Italians also eat slightly less added sugar, &lt;a href="https://www.helgilibrary.com/charts/sugar-consumption-per-capita-rose-174-to-322-kg-in-italy-in-2021/" target="_blank"&gt;71 pounds per person&lt;/a&gt; in 2021, compared to 74.3 pounds &lt;a href="https://www.helgilibrary.com/indicators/sugar-consumption-per-capita/usa/#:~:text=Sugar%20consumption%20per%20capita%20reached,of%2026.6%20kg%20in%201985." target="_blank"&gt;in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Relatedly, Italians drink less soda. It’s hard to find comparable data, but U.S. consumers buy an average of about&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8676708/" target="_blank"&gt; 37 gallons&lt;/a&gt; of soda a year, about three times what &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8676708/" target="_blank"&gt;Italians drink&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They certainly don’t eat low-carb; Italians get a slightly higher percent of calories from &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-dietary-energy-supply-from-carbohydrates-vs-gdp-per-capita" target="_blank"&gt;carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt; than Americans do (48.5 percent vs. 46.4 percent).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UKRKXCP2KBGNLCFDNHDD5HUBRY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To avoid American-style weight gain, though, Italians don’t have to eat differently; they just have to eat less. That’s the simple thermodynamic truth. And although eating different foods can certainly contribute to eating less, many other factors come into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MQ3AYRG7Y5ADDGKQB2ZRRWJPKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Two of them, in particular, are on vivid display in Italy. Two really important ones, which could easily account for the weight-gain gap: portion size and snacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LYSWJZDJSRG4POC2PDQYVFASIE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many years ago, U.S. de facto nutrition-expert-in-chief &lt;a href="https://www.foodpolitics.com/about/" target="_blank"&gt;Marion Nestle&lt;/a&gt; told me that portion size in the U.S. could single-handedly account for all the excess calories Americans consume; when portion sizes double, we eat, on average, about &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.12.0303" target="_blank"&gt;a third&lt;/a&gt; more. Italian portions of just about everything are smaller, although it’s impossible to say just how much. (When I asked Nestle whether there was any rigorous assessment, she laughed in my face, to the extent you can do that by email.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7ABI7MMU3JCU5HTDWCK3SCAGUQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Snacking, though, may be an even bigger issue, and it is just as resistant to reliable data. But all the Italians I spoke with, including faculty members at the University of Gastronomic Sciences in northern Italy, agreed. Eating between meals (or after dinner) isn’t nearly as common in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PF44DLOPUJBD5BL76CPUI3POYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But it’s not just about eating between meals. It’s about living in a food environment that doesn’t facilitate eating between meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YFOSORXIIFFQDETWNI3DDNEDJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I spent time in both small towns and large cities in the northern half of Italy, and there wasn’t food everywhere. The only foods I saw people eating on the street were gelato (a lot!) and focaccia or pizza (not as much). There weren’t places to duck in and get a quick Frappuccino. There were no shops selling giant cinnamon buns, or pretzels, or soda. The pharmacies and hardware stores didn’t have a rack of candy and salty snacks at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YSZ2MJXT2FGTPFLY2HIZSORRIA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The places where there was food had very little that you could just pick up and eat. The outdoor markets (and most cities have one) had stall after stall stocked with vegetables, fruit, cheese, charcuterie, bread and meat (alongside clothing, housewares and leather goods). But there were no funnel cakes. There were no smoothies. There were no corn dogs. People browsed the markets without eating. Go figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="W32WA55PYVFITOXHMCMY4G26FQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And now the question changes. Why have the people who created the American food environment — Big Food, but also many smaller producers and franchises — been so much less successful in Italy than other places? &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00394-021-02733-7.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Italians eat less processed food&lt;/a&gt; than Americans do, but they also eat less of it than almost anyone in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5LAB7YW4VVD5VFZ6ZRKSXCLNXM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I’m certainly not going to swan in, spend a month in the country and form a theory about how food is wrapped up in Italian identity. There are people who spend their entire careers studying Italian food culture, which has no simple through-line. Italy, as we know it, didn’t even exist until the 19th century, and scholars argue about the origins of some of the foods we think of as iconically Italian (pasta and pizza, for starters). Historian Rachel Laudan, author of “&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/45HkAxK" target="_blank"&gt;Cuisine and Empire&lt;/a&gt;,” told me that it wasn’t until about the 1960s that what we think of as Italian food fed most Italians. Before that, meat, cheese and eggs — key ingredients of the Italian menu — were mostly unaffordable for the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FHOTWNEVORETPLY5YXKX2VSD64" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However it happened, there’s no question that food, and a way of eating it, is central to many Italians’ sense of Italianness. And a cuisine that forms part of a national identity is something America, a nation of immigrants, doesn’t have. Although I’m a big fan of a patchwork food culture where I can enjoy food from around the world, food here is something we eat, not something we are, so we never had that bulwark against the incursion of cheap, junky food everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="633KZGQ2HZEXNGTVGUFXU6HBXI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I’m not sure Italians can hold out forever. For the time being, they’re maintaining a way of eating that means they eat less; there are about &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-supply#caloric-supply" target="_blank"&gt;200 calories fewer per person&lt;/a&gt; per day in their food supply than in Americans’.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 'go-to' way many clinicians measure healthy weight may be deeply flawed, according to new research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A population study from the University of Florida (UF) has found that BMI, or &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/9464-body-mass-index-bmi"&gt;body mass index&lt;/a&gt;, is not the best option for predicting future health risks associated with weight – not by a long shot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another method, which directly measures body fat and has been around for decades, has now put BMI to shame. &lt;span&gt;It's called a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioelectrical_impedance_analysis"&gt;&lt;span&gt;bioelectrical impedance analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (BIA).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a nationally representative analysis, those with high body fat levels, as measured by BIA, faced a&lt;span&gt; 262 percent increased risk of death from heart disease compared to those with lower levels.&lt;br&gt;

Some medical organizations have even advised doctors to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/two-weeks-ago-the-bmi-was-quietly-wound-back-as-the-go-to-weight-measure-in-the-us"&gt;deemphasize the use of BMI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health services researcher, Arch Mainous, and his colleagues at UF have now proposed a much-needed alternative, and it takes less than a minute to carry out. BIA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a direct measurement of body fat using a portable, inexpensive device.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The contraption works by sending a weak electric current into body tissue to determine muscle and fat composition. The technology has been commercially available since the 1980s, but only recently have modern fitness trackers and smartwatches begun to incorporate BIA sensors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166281" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166281" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BIAdevice-642x254.png" alt="BIA Wrist Device" class="size-medium wp-image-166281" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BIAdevice-642x254.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BIAdevice-600x237.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BIAdevice.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166281" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;BIA wrist device.

"This is the ultimate Coke versus Pepsi test. And BMI failed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sure, BMI is simple and easy to compute, but it comes with some serious limitations. People who are muscular, for instance, can sometimes be deemed overweight or obese. And on the flip side, those who have a normal BMI but elevated body fat percentages may be unaware that they may face added health risks, such as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/metabolic-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20351916"&gt;metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt; or type 2 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mainous and colleagues argue that BIA is a more accurate alternative, and the devices that measure it are inexpensive and compact enough to become a regular feature of medical clinics. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The UF team predicts that if their results are validated in larger and more diverse cohorts, "it is likely that measuring body fat percentage with BIA will become a standard of care".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"These data will drive better discussions in the doctor's office as well as public health initiatives with the goal of improving the health of all," the researchers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1370/afm.240330"&gt;&lt;span&gt;conclude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1370/afm.240330"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Annals of Family Medicine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two men were left riddled with parasitic worms after they received infected kidney transplants at two U.S. hospitals, a new case report reveals.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two kidneys had come from the same organ donor, who had resided in the Caribbean before death, according to the report, published June 18 in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412510" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412510" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first of the two kidney recipients, a 61-year-old man, had undergone transplant surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital (MassGen). Ten weeks after receiving the transplant, he was transferred back to MassGen after an initial admission to a different hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had developed nausea, vomiting, excessive thirst, abdominal discomfort, back pain and a fever. At the first hospital, doctors found fluid building up in his lungs, and the man began breathing quickly, feeling as though he couldn't get enough air, and his oxygen levels dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he entered respiratory failure and shock — meaning he had dangerously low blood pressure — he was transferred to the intensive care unit of MassGen, where doctors documented a purple rash, like a constellation of bruises, spreading across the skin of his stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctors began an extensive investigation into the patient's medical history and ran a battery of tests to pinpoint the cause of his symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/32-scary-parasitic-diseases" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/32-scary-parasitic-diseases"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32 scary parasitic diseases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-xiobYnRD9vYBSnqmmhKNri" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-xiobYnRD9vYBSnqmmhKNri slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient was on immunosuppressive medications to prevent his body from rejecting his new kidney, making him more susceptible to infections. The medical team, including infectious disease and organ transplant expert &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/17244/camille-kotton" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/17244/camille-kotton" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Camille Kotton&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, had the challenge of whittling down a lengthy list of possible infections to find the most likely cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They could rule out bacterial infections, because the man had been given antibiotics and wasn't improving. He was also taking an antiviral and had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19. That left some kind of parasite as a likely culprit. This was backed up by the fact that levels of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23402-eosinophils" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23402-eosinophils" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eosinophils&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a type of white blood cell that fights parasitic infections, had also spiked in the man's blood. These cells can also spike due to drug reactions or transplant rejection, but those causes were unlikely given the man's symptoms, Kotton noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;A photograph obtained on admission to the intensive care unit shows a purple rash on the man's abdomen. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: The New England Journal of Medicine ©2025)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kotton &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37005911/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37005911/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;had heard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23575239/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23575239/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;of cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in which transplanted organs infected their recipients with a small roundworm called &lt;em&gt;Strongyloides stercoralis&lt;/em&gt;. She contacted New England Donor Services, a regional organ-procurement organization, about the potential contamination. Although the kidney donor was deceased, they were able to test a vial of the donor's blood, which had antibodies for &lt;em&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/em&gt;, meaning the donor's immune system had at some point encountered the worm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests of the patient's blood samples showed that he did not have antibodies to &lt;em&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/em&gt; before the transplant, but he did afterward. When the medical team sampled various sites across the man's body, they found that the worms had spread far and wide, invading his abdomen, lungs and skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Panels A through C of this figure show worm larvae found in clinical samples from the MassGen patient.

U.S. doctors cannot use organs from people with certain active infections, such as tuberculosis, and donated organs are tested for infectious diseases, but these tests don't always catch everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review noted 13 proven or probable &lt;em&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/em&gt; infections over a decade, accounting for 42% of all parasitic infections transmitted by organ transplants. Prior to this review, fewer than 1 in 4 organ transplant organizations regularly screened for &lt;em&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/em&gt;, but in 2023, the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hrsa.unos.org/media/gwvejhen/optn_dtac_endemics_bp_june2023.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://hrsa.unos.org/media/gwvejhen/optn_dtac_endemics_bp_june2023.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network called for universal testing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for this parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MassGen medical team treated the man with ivermectin, a powerful antiparasitic drug. They received special permission to administer the drug directly underneath his skin to combat the full body infection, which ultimately cured him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other medical centers that had transplanted organs from the same deceased donor were notified. This flagged a 66-year-old man who was being treated at Albany Medical Center for fatigue, low white blood cells and worsening kidney function following a transplant operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing notes with the MassGen team, the doctors were able to successfully treat this second patient, who had received the donor's other kidney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Organ transplants save lives," a spokesperson for Albany Medical Center told Live Science in an email. "In rare cases like this, the communication and coordination between our hospitals and the involvement of infectious disease physicians at both hospitals was critically important, as was the alert our regional organ procurement organization provided us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live Science have contacted MassGen for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

There are ways we can improve sleep, even in older adults."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143047" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143047" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/DeepSleepAlzheimersOlderPerson_R_U_642.jpg" alt="Older lady sleeping " class="size-full wp-image-143047" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/DeepSleepAlzheimersOlderPerson_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/DeepSleepAlzheimersOlderPerson_R_U_642-621x415.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/DeepSleepAlzheimersOlderPerson_R_U_642-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143047" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A generous amount of solid shut-eye could help support the decline in memory that sets in as dementia begins to take hold.

Likewise, clumpy amyloid-beta proteins might only be a sign of Alzheimer's disease, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-where-alzheimer-s-plaques-might-really-come-from"&gt;not its root cause&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-hidden-compound-in-rosemary-could-help-fight-alzheimers?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;A Hidden Compound in Rosemary Could Help Fight Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, levels of amyloid-beta proteins are commonly used as a marker of Alzheimer's disease, as research suggests they – and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-find-biological-changes-visible-up-to-30-years-before-alzheimer-s-symptoms-appear"&gt;another protein called tau&lt;/a&gt; – can start clogging up brain cells decades before symptoms of the disease arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past research from Walker's group found significant levels of amyloid-beta aggregating in the brains of older adults can disrupt deep sleep – also known as non-rapid eye movement slow wave sleep – and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4035"&gt;impair memory function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some folk appear to stave off the decline that comes with Alzheimer's disease, even when levels of amyloid-beta proteins are relatively high. To find out why, Walker and colleagues monitored participants' brain waves as they slept, and then asked them to complete a memory test the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those whose brain scans revealed similarly high levels of beta-amyloid deposits, getting a good night's sleep seemed to make a critical difference in cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This effect was only seen when the researchers looked specifically at non-rapid eye movement slow wave sleep, and not at other sleep wave frequencies or sleep stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143046" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143046" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GraphicOfDeepSleepAndMemory.jpg" alt="Illustration of Brains " class="size-full wp-image-143046" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GraphicOfDeepSleepAndMemory.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GraphicOfDeepSleepAndMemory-434x415.jpg 434w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GraphicOfDeepSleepAndMemory-600x574.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143046" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;In people with similar amounts of beta-amyloid protein deposits, more deep sleep corresponded with improved memory function.

It also points to sleep quality being important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With a certain level of brain pathology, you're not destined for cognitive symptoms or memory issues," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/03/deep-sleep-may-mitigate-alzheimers-memory-loss-berkeley-research-shows/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; UC Berkeley neuroscientist and lead author Zsófia Zavecz &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/03/deep-sleep-may-mitigate-alzheimers-memory-loss-berkeley-research-shows/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of the study findings in 2023.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although people may display molecular changes indicating a progression toward Alzheimer's disease, Zavecz says their findings suggest lifestyle factors can help buffer against those effects. "One of those factors is sleep and, specifically, deep sleep," she &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/03/deep-sleep-may-mitigate-alzheimers-memory-loss-berkeley-research-shows/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, though small, also hints at why getting good sleep naturally might be a better option than taking sleeping pills to get some shut-eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other research shows users of sleeping pills &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-sleeping-pill-may-reduce-the-build-up-of-alzheimers-proteins-study-finds"&gt;appear to have lower levels of amyloid proteins&lt;/a&gt; in their cerebrospinal fluid, which washes the brain clean at night. But these medications come with side effects; they may also lull people into shallow bouts of sleep rather than deep sleep phases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, to set yourself up for a good night's sleep, Zavecz suggests cutting out  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="166354" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; late in the day, doing some exercise, avoiding screen time, and taking a hot shower before bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you snooze, rest assured scientists are working hard to figure out the knotty problems of Alzheimer's disease, which affects millions of people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has been published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-02811-z"&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this article was first published in May 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This keeps blood flow active, reduces clot risks, and avoids insulin resistance.

			&lt;p&gt;A drug that can be taken orally could soon rival the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-ozempic-and-why-are-people-saying-its-a-sad-way-to-lose-weight"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; for treating type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="166308" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and obesity, according to a new study. Although its efficacy hasn't yet been tested in humans, the compound could bypass&lt;span&gt; some of the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-vs-wegovy-the-risks-and-side-effects-of-semaglutide-drugs"&gt;harmful side-effects&lt;/a&gt; associated with similar drugs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the famous family of &lt;span&gt;GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs, this new candidate targets the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-2_adrenergic_receptor"&gt;β2-adrenergic receptor&lt;/a&gt; (β2AR). Drugs that do this aren't new:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salbutamol"&gt;salbutamol&lt;/a&gt; (sold as Ventolin among other brand names) is widely prescribed for use in short stints to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clenbuterol"&gt;Clenbuterol&lt;/a&gt; is also prescribed for asthma in some countries, though it's better known as a performance-enhancing drug, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2165/11537540-000000000-00000"&gt;banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency&lt;/a&gt; for its anabolic effects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For more than a decade, scientists have been trying to find a way to harness the benefits of β2AR agonists, without setting off their harmful effects. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;They&lt;/span&gt; can stimulate skeletal muscle glucose uptake and burn fat, mimicking the effects of exercise – but they have been considered &lt;span&gt;too risky for treating diabetes or obesity, because of their tendency to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/24851-beta-agonist"&gt;wreak havoc on the heart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-weight-loss-strategy-is-5x-more-effective-than-ozempic-trials-show?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;One Weight Loss Strategy Is 5x More Effective Than Ozempic, Trials Show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The body's β2-adrenergic receptors are coupled with G proteins, and when activated for long periods (by β2AR drugs, for instance), &lt;span&gt;the G proteins set off a chain reaction which leads to cardiovascular problems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"That would lead to heart rate increases, systolic blood pressure increases, and, eventually, that over-sustained exposure would lead to increases in heart weight and cardiac hypertrophy," molecular biologist Shane Wright, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden, &lt;a href="https://www.bioworld.com/articles/721572-exercise-mimicking-compound-offers-alternative-to-glp-1-therapies?v=preview"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Mar de Miguel of Bioworld.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166348" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166348" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/gr5_lrg-1.jpg" alt="(A) Glucose tolerance test in DIO mice following treatment with clenbuterol, salbutamol, or compounds 15, 21, or 26.

And, while rucking doesn't &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/strength-training-exercises-walk-faster-barrys-rcna96179/" target="_blank"&gt;replace the need for regular strength training&lt;/a&gt;, it can help boost the benefits you get from a low-impact cardio workout like walking, Linkul explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-32d181" class="body-heading"&gt;How to Get Started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-63bba9" class="body-graf"&gt;If you're ready to try loaded walking, you don't need to invest in fancy new equipment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c68c31" class="body-graf"&gt;Instead, grab a backpack and place a few books or barbell plates inside, Linkul suggests. It's also a good idea to wrap them in towels or other soft material to protect your back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a0f766" class="body-graf"&gt;In a pinch, you could also use some canned goods or a dumbbell, but Linkul recommends against this generally because it's not likely to be very comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2b06aa" class="body-graf"&gt;You should start with a lighter weight than you think need, between 5 and 10 pounds for people who weigh 150 pounds or less and 10 to 15 pounds for people who weigh more than 150 pounds, Linkul says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-295a98" class="body-graf"&gt;Once your pack is filled, make sure it sits correctly on your back — you want the weight to be distributed evenly and higher up than you might expect. Ideally, it should be closer to between your shoulder blades than sitting on your lower back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d3cc7" class="body-graf"&gt;For your first walk, Linkul recommends a time-based goal, like walking out for 10 minutes and back for 10 minutes. He suggests doing that three times a week and increasing the time gradually as you get more comfortable with rucking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-98a216" class="body-graf"&gt;If going outside isn't an option for you, rucking on a treadmill is a great alternative. Linkul goes rucking on a treadmill twice a week, and gets outside for his third weekly weighted walking workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-481386" class="body-graf"&gt;As you do more rucking, you may find that you want to invest some specialized equipment, like a backpack with a hip strap and plates designed for rucking, that makes the activity more comfortable.

The data showed a sharp rise, since 2020, in Americans reporting serious difficulty remembering, concentrating or making decisions, which are among the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Moments earlier, my colleague had presented a graph with a nearly identical curve – this one tracking the steep increase in adult stimulant prescriptions since 2020. By 2023, CDC data had confirmed that a record &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;7.8 per&lt;/span&gt; cent of American adults reported an ADHD diagnosis. Google searches for ‘ADHD’ surged, and TikTok videos tagged #ADHD had racked up more than &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;20 billion&lt;/span&gt; views. At the very most, we could be experiencing an adult ADHD epidemic in the United States. At the very least, ADHD was now suddenly very fashionable to the public. Yet, a third explanation is also possible – for better or worse, the ADHD diagnostic category might be becoming more inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can adults develop ADHD? Let’s examine the possibility of an adult ADHD epidemic. This option could be possible only if adult-onset ADHD were a valid phenomenon. ADHD is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder in the &lt;em&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;DSM&lt;/em&gt;), a handbook published by the American Psychiatric Association to govern responsible diagnosis of mental disorders by healthcare practitioners. The neurodevelopmental disorder category (which also includes intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder) is characterised by disrupted brain functioning stemming from abnormal neural development. ADHD is largely inherited through a person’s genes but also influenced by environmental factors such as stressors and protective supports. As the &lt;em&gt;DSM&lt;/em&gt; defines neurodevelopmental disorders, onset is in childhood, but the course usually lasts a lifetime. In the case of ADHD, the &lt;em&gt;DSM&lt;/em&gt; requires onset of at least some symptoms – difficulties in self-regulation such as attention problems, hyperactivity, mental restlessness and impulsivity – by &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;age 12.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistent with the &lt;em&gt;DSM&lt;/em&gt;’s description, research suggests that ADHD is a chronic and lifelong experience for most with the diagnosis. Studies investigating the possibility of true adult-onset ADHD have largely &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10578-021-01159-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;come up&lt;/a&gt; empty handed. So, what explains rising rates of adult ADHD in the US over the past five years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One factor may be that the &lt;em&gt;DSM&lt;/em&gt; has become more inclusive. In 2013, the &lt;em&gt;DSM&lt;/em&gt; was revised to its fifth edition with several changes that formally relaxed ADHD’s diagnostic criteria. However, it is unclear what impact these changes had on future diagnostic rates. &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DSM-5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; pushed the age of onset cutoff from seven to &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;12 years&lt;/span&gt; old, reduced the number of symptoms needed (from six to five) for an adult ADHD diagnosis, loosened the level of impairment (problems in daily life functioning) needed for diagnosis, and allowed individuals with autism spectrum disorder to receive a co-occurring ADHD diagnosis. Ultimately, by expanding the diagnostic category, these changes could have increased rates of ADHD diagnosis in adults and children. However, the revision happened in 2013, so it seems unlikely to have triggered the sudden spike in adult ADHD diagnoses in the 2020s. Still, relaxing the adult ADHD criteria in 2013 may have been one source of kindling for the 2020s’ later explosive trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DSM-5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; portrays ADHD as a disorder you either have or have not, ADHD is actually a false binary – comprised of symptoms that appear across a range. Indeed, the diagnosis of ADHD demonstrates a condition that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17995483/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;represents&lt;/a&gt; the extreme end of a trait continuum (like hypertension or obesity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare providers often use a checklist of behaviours which, in aggregate, form a person’s level of ‘trait ADHD’. Everyone falls somewhere on this continuum, which includes&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a person’s abilities in areas such as paying attention, organising tasks, remembering daily activities, and modulating their verbal and motor activity levels. People with very low trait ADHD do very well with most of the behaviours on the checklist. People with high trait ADHD will struggle with many of them. If a person describes above-average ability on the checklist, we call it a strength. When someone has below average ability, we call it a weakness or a symptom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trait ADHD displays a bell curve in the US population and providers must decide where to draw the line between weakness and clinical diagnosis. Formally, the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DSM-5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; offers a symptom cutoff for adults – at least five of nine formal symptoms of either inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity. Yet, ADHD-symptoms are common and relatable – in fact, the average US adult &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ijcp.13260" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; two to three. How severe is enough to deem a symptom present? Conventional clinical wisdom advises that when a person can’t manage in everyday life because of many prominent and chronic ADHD symptoms, an ADHD diagnosis is appropriate. Yet, inevitably, clinicians encounter a grey area when individuals present with mild ADHD weaknesses and no obvious struggles in daily functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;aking an adult ADHD diagnosis can be done with confidence in someone like Jake*, a 26-year-old I first met when he was a visibly hyperactive third-grader. If Jake walked into a mental health clinic seeking evaluation for adult ADHD, he could share clear stories from his childhood as an athletic but severely bullied child who received special help at school due to disabling problems focusing and completing schoolwork. His highly invested parents could corroborate Jake’s account with their own struggles wrestling with him over personal hygiene and sacrificing their free time to provide Jake the academic support needed to eke across the high-school finish line. As a young adult still living at home, he appears friendless, withdrawn, and immersed in his video games. Though it took him six years, he completed a bachelor’s degree in education, hoping to become a teacher. But with inconsistent motivation to engage in an employment search and challenges with social interactions, he has been working at the local zoo’s ticket counter. Since Jake does not have a car (he totalled the last two and could not afford a new one), his father drops him off each morning on his way to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jake’s impairments due to his ADHD would be obvious to a clinician. He has experienced many negative consequences because of chronic, elevated trait ADHD, and these consequences reduce and interfere with his daily life functioning. Like Jake, adults with ADHD experience a range of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-024-00495-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;consequences&lt;/a&gt; that can include employment instability, educational under-attainment, strained relationships with family members, limited social relationships, driving and safety incidents, and challenges managing a household. They also can experience hidden psychological impairments with self-esteem, stress response, anxiety/self-doubt, and feeling disconnected from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, healthcare providers are meeting with patients who come in complaining of a lighter form of ADHD. When Rebecca* walked into a clinic for a possible first-time ADHD diagnosis, she was 41. It had not occurred to her that she might have ADHD until Facebook ads started popping up on her feed during the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/span&gt; pandemic. One said: ‘Working hard but not moving up? You might have undiagnosed ADHD.’ Another said: ‘Indecisive? Anxious? A two-minute quiz can tell you if you have ADHD.’ One day, her curiosity got the better of her, and she clicked on an image. Looking back on the past &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;20-plus&lt;/span&gt; years of her adult life, she wondered whether a diagnosis of ADHD would explain some of the struggles and disappointments she had experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Rebecca’s clinician might feel stuck on whether to make this borderline diagnosis of ADHD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most notable to Rebecca was her lack of success in the dating department. Sure, she had a serious boyfriend of four years who was a great, laid-back guy. He owned the house they lived in together and had a successful job. He was eight years younger and, like her, saw the prospect of children as a ball and chain to be avoided. Prior to this relationship, though, she had been devastated by two broken-off engagements and one long-term partnership in which she had been cheated on for years. Her entire social circle had known it was happening, but no one had said anything. Rebecca processed these experiences as personal failures that were her fault, though she could not quite explain what she had done wrong. She had many, many close friends and was gifted at several hobbies, including surfing and pottery – her pieces showed in local galleries and were a dependable income source. Nonetheless, Rebecca felt that she was not the full package. It was not just intimate relationships that had been a source of emotional pain for her. Although Rebecca had graduated from a topnotch college with honours studying industrial design, she had bounced between jobs over the years, chronically indecisive about whether she preferred to work for herself or someone else. As a talented jack-of-all-trades, she could easily pick up work in several different arenas, but ultimately found these endeavours curtailed by the temptation to take off to work and travel abroad for months. Now, in midlife, she was questioning the life decisions that had left her living paycheck to paycheck, with no savings or assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebecca would be a much more challenging diagnostic scenario for clinicians than Jake. With no obvious childhood history of ADHD symptoms, some might dismiss the possibility of ADHD immediately. Yet, Rebecca reports a moderate amount of relationship and employment instability, as well as financial impacts of her life decisions, paired with persistent feelings of self-blame and self-doubt. These negative experiences can be linked to a pattern of restlessness (a form of mental hyperactivity) in her life, but she reports only three symptoms of inattention and two symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity on an ADHD checklist – not enough for a diagnosis. Rebecca’s clinician might feel stuck on whether to make this borderline diagnosis of ADHD. Yet, performing the due diligence of interviewing her boyfriend, Rebecca’s clinician becomes a bit more confident. The boyfriend describes forgetfulness, difficulties with follow-through on household tasks, talkativeness, and distractibility that are just ‘a part of who &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;she is’.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the clinician evaluating Rebecca returns as his anchor to the question of whether her symptoms are interfering with her functioning, and decides to make the diagnosis. But, just as easily, another clinician could dismiss Rebecca’s ‘ADHD-Light’ as subclinical (not severe enough for diagnosis), noting that the symptoms are not substantially interfering with her daily life and that her childhood history of ADHD is inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many, like Rebecca, sit in a grey area of the ADHD bell curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before dismissing Rebecca’s ADHD entirely, let’s consider the defensible argument for treating adults with light or what practitioners call ‘subclinical’ ADHD. First, many go on to experience full ADHD at another point in their life – so helping Rebecca now (with an evidence-based approach like cognitive-behavioural therapy or a low dose of medication) could be viewed as a form of prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that subclinical ADHD is not always associated with ADHD’s signature cognitive &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002239562030056X?casa_token=-2fHo6Pv2aYAAAAA:zjQMUNMYPHoYO7bLXvj5jMqhsNJ4ZvWZmyttWUBk-1PFXmrqTE5-XQMp7dl574eWtRoQEwhG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;differences&lt;/a&gt; like executive function difficulties, and is less likely to be associated with a family &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/ajp.2006.163.10.1720" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; of the disorder. Individuals with subclinical ADHD often do not experience meaningful impairments or co-occurring diagnoses and are more likely to notice benefits like creativity from their ADHD than people with moderate to severe ADHD. Yet, compared with the general population, they are at elevated risk for secondary complications from their ADHD symptoms – such as substance use &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10550490601082767?casa_token=gdxOUpW_a-oAAAAA:JnqB-1ViBzqGwm9fTbiCLvWrH8dOV95ybN6JwIShCSFP4qo2qEBKXUPOrGD2JM-Tj_y1f9JmpCY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;disorders&lt;/a&gt;. They also appear to respond to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/article/17/6/961/692761" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;treatment&lt;/a&gt; in similar ways to individuals meeting full ADHD criteria. So, if Rebecca’s provider thought she could benefit from treatment, they might make the diagnosis to qualify her for care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;ne factor that may be nudging subthreshold and mild ADHD patients, like Rebecca, into clinics is the emerging neurodiversity movement. Diagnosed with ADHD, Rebecca feels she is seeing her life clearly for the first time, and experiences meaningful relief with treatment. This transformational experience, felt by many late-diagnosed ‘ADHD-Light’ adults, is calling into question the historical rigidity of ADHD’s diagnostic requirements. The argument is that people like Rebecca – who might not meet ADHD’s traditional impairment and childhood onset criteria – should not be denied the opportunity to hold a diagnosis that feels true to their identity and resonates with their lived experiences. This framing is part and parcel of the neurodiversity movement, whose ideas caught fire in the ADHD community during the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/span&gt; pandemic. The neurodiversity framework encourages a more inclusive definition of adult ADHD as a fundamentally disabling neurotype, regardless of one’s external impairment level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clinician adhering to the neurodiversity conceptualisation of ADHD might consider the concepts of masking (camouflaging ADHD symptoms to assimilate to social norms) and compensating (employing strategies that mitigate the impact of symptoms on daily life) when forming diagnostic conclusions. Ultimately, they might override the need to demonstrate objective impairment or childhood symptoms if they can point to identifiable masking or compensatory factors that prevented their emergence. The neurodiversity movement also raises questions about whether the exhaustion from constantly suppressing one’s ADHD can supplant the impairment criterion. Interestingly, many common mental disorders in the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DSM-5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have a ‘distress and/or impairment’ criterion for establishing clinically sufficient severity, but ADHD employs only an impairment criterion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebecca’s clinician might point to her intelligence and sought-after talents as strengths that masked her childhood symptoms and allowed her to compensate for ADHD as an adult. If she had not been so good at school and so charismatic in her personality, perhaps ADHD traits would have visibly emerged in childhood. If she had not had multiple monetisable skills, and a boyfriend providing free housing, her prominent restlessness could have become a serious threat to her financial survival. Even Jake found ways to offset his ADHD with help from his parents – what would his life be like today if they had not pushed him through his education, given him a stable place to live, and provided him with reliable transportation? Still, if a person is a sum of their parts, then it’s also defensible to take a holistic view of ADHD – that Rebecca is a person whose net impairment level is not that meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;The 2020s have witnessed a powerful great awakening of women who came to identify with ADHD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several pandemic-related factors may have also contributed to the tug-of-war over ADHD’s diagnostic borders. As Americans began to spend more time online, many people increasingly shared their diverse lived experiences with ADHD. An explosion of ADHD anecdotes shared on social media posts may or may not have &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0319335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;aligned&lt;/a&gt; with scientifically validated information about the disorder but certainly stretched the public’s conceptualisation of ADHD’s many faces. Because novel rather than tried-and-true information garners the most social media clicks, a long list of ‘secret’ or ‘unrecognised’ crowdsourced ADHD symptoms began to proliferate online. As this list grew, so did the number of people who found the ADHD diagnosis to be relatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of the #ADHD world also created some money-making opportunities. Many ADHD posts touting lived experience linked directly to purchasable products or services such as supplements or coaching. Most notably, several large-scale digital startups seized an opportunity in the midst of relaxed US laws for prescribing stimulant&lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt; (the main class of medications for ADHD), and began offering quick and easy online diagnoses to support their economy-of-scale business models. They unleashed a sea of digital ads upon their potential consumers (like the post that caught Rebecca’s eye). These ads also may have influenced self-referral rates for ADHD – through a digital startup or otherwise. It is worth noting that a few ADHD-centric prescribing companies (like &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/telehealth-company-cerebral-agrees-pay-over-36-million-connection-business-practices#:~:text=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cerebral&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/founderceo-and-clinical-president-digital-health-company-arrested-100m-adderall-distribution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Done&lt;/a&gt;) later fell under federal investigation for predatory practices and subsequently folded their ADHD-prescribing operations. At the very least, we can say that the internet had developed a vested interest in expanding the definition of who could benefit from ADHD products and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing women’s movement within the ADHD community may also be increasing self-referrals for ADHD diagnoses. As the CDC and other sources &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/adhd/php/adults/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reveal&lt;/a&gt;, the majority of adults seeking diagnosis and treatment for the first time are women in their 20s, 30s and 40s. The 2020s have witnessed a powerful great awakening of women who came to identify with the ADHD diagnosis for the first time by sharing lived experiences with one another online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surge of women makes sense. It is well established that ADHD historically has been diagnosed at lower rates in girls than boys. Because research on ADHD has historically excluded girls, we do not fully know if this trend reflects a structural inequity, later-onset of ADHD in girls and women (perhaps influenced by hormonal factors), or a lower prevalence of girls and women at the extreme end of the ADHD-trait distribution (perhaps due to protective &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924977X2400275X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;effects&lt;/a&gt; of being biologically female on the expression of ADHD genetic risks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Emerging research has revealed that ADHD can be highly unstable across an individual’s lifespan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a grassroots fashion, the ADHD women’s movement is mobilising around the sentiment that women with ADHD were missed &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;en masse&lt;/span&gt; during childhood due to diagnostic criteria that favour men and boys. One action item of this ADHD advocacy &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/improve-gender-equity-in-the-diagnosis-of-adult-adhd-petition-to-apsard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;space&lt;/a&gt; is a push to expand the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DSM-5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; criteria to better address the clinical presentations of women with ADHD. The diagnostic implications of the women’s movement within ADHD are complex, and women are indisputably expanding definitions of what ADHD can look like. These new portraits of women-specific ADHD, and cries of structural inequity, have caught the attention of sympathetic clinicians. However, research has not yet sorted out best practices for identifying ADHD in girls and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD’s recent surge is probably not just a societal change in how we define and recognise the disorder, though. Recent studies reveal that ADHD can wax and wane. Thus, it’s possible that more Americans are experiencing clinically meaningful difficulties with ADHD since the pandemic. Emerging research from the past few years has revealed that, within an individual, ADHD can be highly &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.2021.21010032" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;unstable&lt;/a&gt; across the lifespan. Many, if not most, individuals with ADHD, will meet formal diagnostic criteria for the disorder during some years but not others. Some research confirms that fluctuations in environmental demands can &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/fluctuating-adhd-multimodal-treatment-of-adhd-mta-study/?trk=public_post_comment-text" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;influence&lt;/a&gt; the ups and downs of an individual’s ADHD. What’s more, ADHD symptoms can wax and wane even in people &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.2017.17030298" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;without&lt;/a&gt; ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way of thinking lines up with the idea that genes and environment work together in ADHD. In other words, whether someone’s genetic risk for ADHD shows up in real life can depend on what’s happening around them. So, if certain things in society made ADHD symptoms worse, people who were already on the edge of having ADHD might have started feeling a lot more symptoms all at once – and many may have looked for some kind of support at the same time, whether that meant medication, therapy, coaching or even supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea matches what a large &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/10870547231158750" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of studies found: around the world, ADHD symptoms went up during the pandemic. It also fits with the census data I went over with my colleague from the CDC back in Baltimore. So, if ADHD symptoms got worse during the pandemic and people started talking about it more online through #ADHD social media content, it makes sense that more people in the grey area started wondering if they had ADHD. But what actually caused the jump in official diagnoses? One likely reason is the rise of easy-to-access telehealth services, like those offered by online mental health companies. According to a 2024 CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7340a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, about one in five adults with ADHD got their diagnosis using online modalities, and half have used telehealth for ADHD care in the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;hat is a clinician to do? Should a practitioner provide a diagnosis to a usually subclinical individual during a unique period when their ADHD spikes into the clinical zone? Doing so is probably not overdiagnosis since the individual will likely meet all criteria for ADHD (the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DSM-5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; requires &lt;em&gt;several &lt;/em&gt;symptoms to be present since childhood, not the full syndrome). In future years, the broader field will likely recognise ADHD’s fluctuating course across the lifespan and the factors that trigger ADHD flare-ups. The ADHD diagnosis will inevitably become more inclusive as the science of ADHD’s fluctuations translates into clinical practice. Clinicians may be less likely to refuse a diagnosis to people with a form of ADHD that tends to turn off &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;and on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognising themselves in the expanding list of relatable, crowdsourced ADHD symptoms, more adults than ever may be self-diagnosing or wondering about possible ADHD. Some may have hopped offline to raise this possibility to their longstanding healthcare providers. Today, providers are faced with increasingly challenging diagnostic dilemmas as patients describe their ADHD as being mostly characterised by popularised, crowdsourced &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;non-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DSM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; symptoms such as ‘hyperfocus’, ‘emotional reactivity’, and ‘rejection sensitivity dysphoria’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not clear whether adoption of the neurodiversity framework is as widespread among clinicians as it is on social media. However, there is certainly a growing tension between traditional and alternative ways of thinking about ADHD diagnosis within the clinician workforce. The supposition that clinicians must wade through a pit of what-ifs to unearth a largely unimpaired individual’s true ADHD neurotype is a tall order for many. Although an individual’s level of trait ADHD correlates highly with their genetic load for the disorder, there is no definitive biomarker for ADHD. Some people with elevated genetic risk of ADHD do not display the disorder. Other people with ADHD do not demonstrate a strong genetic load. Trait ADHD is influenced by an interplay of complex biological, psychological and environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Some clinicians fear that the boundaries of ADHD will become too subjective, which will bruise its credibility&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complicate matters, ADHD is best conceptualised as a bundle of cognitive subtraits (like working memory, response to rewards, ability to inhibit one’s behaviour) that contribute to an overarching ADHD behavioural trait. People who achieve a high score on an overall trait-ADHD behavioural checklist will show widely varying combinations of these cognitive subtraits. Thus, there are undoubtedly different neurobiological paths to ADHD, and the volume may be turned up or down on those paths based on a range of stable or transient factors. Since ADHD is such a neurocognitively diverse category, there is no objective cognitive test that can reliably confirm the diagnosis. Instead, we clinicians rely on documenting a stable and impairing pattern of observable behaviours consistent with ADHD that are substantiated by multiple individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, there are both vocal advocates and opponents of the neurodiversity framing of ADHD. I have also met open-minded clinicians who feel the neurodiversity framework makes a lot of sense but are hesitant to step away from upholding the strict impairment and childhood-onset criteria. They fear that the boundaries of ADHD will become far too subjective, which will bruise its credibility. They are very protective of a diagnosis that is clearly so disabling to those who meet its strict criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD has always experienced stigma from sceptics in the public and in the broader medical field. For various reasons, similar scrutiny has not been passed on to sister diagnoses like autism spectrum disorder or learning disorder – or spectrum-based medical diagnoses like hypertension or diabetes. Since ADHD traits are on a continuum, and can show up in the general population, the impairment and childhood-onset criteria have acted as important checks and balances. The diagnostic line will inevitably become much blurrier if we kick these checks and balances out of place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD is already vulnerable to misdiagnosis and so affixing an overdiagnosis narrative has always been tempting to those outside the ADHD community. As a standard part of the adult ADHD diagnostic process, clinicians must wade through a complicated process of differential diagnosis (ruling out other suspects) with so-called ADHD ‘mimics’. After all, difficulties with concentration are the second-most common &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37665038/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;symptom&lt;/a&gt; of any disorder in the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DSM-5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. There are many non-ADHD-related factors that alter the neurochemical environment of brain structures implicated in ADHD, creating an ADHD mimic (eg, psychiatric disorders like anxiety and depression, side-effects of medications taken for reasons unrelated to ADHD, normal responses to stress or poor sleep, endocrine disorders and transitions such as hypothyroidism or perimenopause). Differential diagnosis is often the most time-consuming part of a properly performed adult ADHD diagnostic evaluation. Multiple, long encounters are sometimes needed to confidently complete this process. Modern healthcare systems cannot always accommodate this level of due diligence, which creates a vulnerability to misdiagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;ut for just as many occasions where ADHD is improperly diagnosed, it also is likely missed. Many adults with ADHD who are late-identified initially come into contact with the mental health system for co-occurring diagnoses such as anxiety, substance use disorders or depression. Often, undiagnosed ADHD is at the root of these secondary complaints, but it is missed by the untrained eye. Thus, for every adult ADHD overdiagnosis there is likely an underdiagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/span&gt; pandemic created global exacerbations in mental health concerns &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032721010570?casa_token=Z5P4KKzkG48AAAAA:uVW46x4ZEBl94zjm2el0uucXNmvKFnZC9GSJKMjTytI83mENxx_dLgEZ_68yZIt5uZdSm1k2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;generally&lt;/a&gt; and a subsequent influx of people seeking help for ADHD and beyond (eg, the US &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-announces-shortage-adderall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shortage&lt;/a&gt; of the stimulant Adderall spawned by increased demand for ADHD treatment). This unprecedented demand required an expansion of the provider workforce, which shifted new providers into the task of making first-time adult ADHD diagnoses. It appears that many primary care doctors and nurse practitioners stepped up to &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10870547241238899" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;meet &lt;/a&gt;this need (in addition to the instant-diagnosis digital startups referenced earlier in this article). Newer providers who are first learning to diagnose adult ADHD acknowledge they get some information from popular sources. While they may be more vulnerable than a veteran ADHD specialist to confusing ADHD for a mimic, they may also be more open to inclusive viewpoints on the nature of ADHD in adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it time to partition the ADHD diagnosis into separate disorders?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Our diagnostic categories need to do a better job of capturing the many faces of ADHD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long understood ADHD as a &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-050817-084917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;collection&lt;/a&gt; of related disorders that impact self-regulation, making it vulnerable to becoming a catch-all category for anyone with attentional concerns. This diagnostic lumping may be expanding the inclusiveness of the ADHD category and producing diagnostic rates that cause public discomfort. Partitioning, rather than discrediting ADHD, may be a consideration. For example, the past &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;75 years&lt;/span&gt; has witnessed the &lt;em&gt;DSM&lt;/em&gt; partition the previously singular diagnosis of depression into separate categories that include major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Perhaps it is time for it to do the same with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of subdividing ADHD into a broader class of multiple disorders must be done through careful research that examines the full implications of diagnostic changes. The vocabulary surrounding future changes is also important. As with depressive diagnoses, reorganisation of a broader category of disorders of attention and self-regulation might consider severity (is there a lighter form of ADHD that mainly impacts psychological factors?), course (are there female sex-specific versions of ADHD with pubertal or perimenopausal onsets?), persistence and stability (is there ADHD that fluctuates with environmental factors?), and features (is there a form of ADHD that is largely experienced as emotion dysregulation?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critical point here is that everyone’s experience of ADHD-like difficulties, and their impacts on how one walks through life, are valid. Our diagnostic categories need to do a better job of capturing the many faces of ADHD and helping patients and clinicians see eye to eye on diagnostic conclusions. Until diverse disorders of attention and self-regulation are properly sorted, ADHD will continue to become more and more inclusive, as additional forms of self-regulation concerns are recognised and pushed into the only diagnostic category available to them. Though we can point to many reasons why diagnostic lumping is problematic, people like Jake and Rebecca still need help, and we want to make sure they can &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;get it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A tiny insect called a midge spreads the disease, and the earliest known case &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5938780/"&gt;dates back to 1955&lt;/a&gt; in a forest worker near a village called Vega de Oropouche in Trinidad. Since most people who were infected with the virus recovered on their own and since cases were so infrequent, it barely registered as a public health concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But a few years ago, something changed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A major Oropouche fever outbreak beginning in 2023 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666517425000689?via%3Dihub"&gt;infected at least 23,000 people&lt;/a&gt; across Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Peru. It wasn’t just confined to remote wilderness areas but was spreading in metropolises like &lt;a href="https://www.ioc.fiocruz.br/en/noticias/instituto-confirma-primeiro-diagnostico-de-febre-oropouche-no-rio-de-janeiro"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;. In some cases, travelers were infected and then brought the virus home: So far, Oropouche fever has &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON545"&gt;sprung up&lt;/a&gt; in the US, Canada, and Europe in people returning from the afflicted region. The outbreak has killed at least five people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The sudden rise of Oropouche disease startled scientists and health officials. Since its discovery, there have only been around &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12159208/"&gt;500,000 known cases&lt;/a&gt;. By contrast, there are upward of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue"&gt;400 million dengue infections&lt;/a&gt; each year. It’s likely then that many more Oropouche infections have gone undetected, especially since its symptoms overlap with those from other diseases and there’s little active screening for the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="what-youll-learn-from-this-story" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 _1lbxzst3 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What you’ll learn from this story&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst6"&gt;&lt;ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1agbrixi _739u100 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What Oropouche fever is, how you can identify it, and what spreads the disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What researchers know about the startling outbreak across South American in 2023 and 2024.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The threat the disease’s spread poses to the United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Now, researchers are looking back at the outbreak to try to find out what they missed and what lessons they can apply to get ahead of future epidemics. Oropouche virus is a critical case study in the complicated factors that drive vector-borne diseases. Dynamics like deforestation, urban sprawl, international travel, and gaps in surveillance are converging to drive up the dangers from infections spread by animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And as the climate changes, new regions are becoming more hospitable to the blood suckers that spread these diseases, increasing the chances of these seemingly-remote infections making it to the US and getting established. That means more people will face threats from illnesses that they may never have considered before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“It’s very likely that these public health problems that people before called ‘tropical disease’ are not so tropical anymore and are basically everywhere,” said &lt;a href="https://medicine.uky.edu/users/wmde227"&gt;William de Souza&lt;/a&gt;, who studies arboviruses — viruses spread by arthropods like insects — at the University of Kentucky. “Vector-borne disease is not a local problem; this is a global problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The rising specter of Oropouche fever comes at a time when the United States is cutting funding for research at universities, pulling back from studying vector-borne disease threats, and ending &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/"&gt;collaborations with other countries&lt;/a&gt; to limit their risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-oropouche-virus-is-a-classic-case-study-in-how-humans-worsen-vector-borne-disease" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The Oropouche virus is a classic case study in how humans worsen vector-borne disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The Oropouche virus belongs to the family of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8004/"&gt;bunyaviruses&lt;/a&gt;. They appear as spheres under a microscope, and they encode their genomes in RNA, rather than DNA as human cells do. RNA viruses tend to have &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(08)00055-4"&gt;high mutation rates&lt;/a&gt;, making it harder to target them with vaccines and increasing the odds of reinfection. Oropuche’s relatives include the viruses behind Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, spread by ticks, and Rift Valley fever, spread by mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Oropouche spreads mainly through the bites of a 1- to 3-millimeter-long insect called, appropriately, a biting midge (Culicoides paraensis). Midges are sometimes called sand flies or no-see-ums in the US, and they breed in damp soil, rotting vegetation, and standing water. Like mosquitoes, they feed on blood to drive their reproduction, but their minuscule bodies can easily slip through mosquito nets. When a midge bites an infected host, it can pass on the pathogen to a human during a subsequent bite. There’s also evidence that the &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/30/12/24-1470_article"&gt;virus may be sexually transmissible&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/11/20/g-s1-34891/oropouche-virus-sexual-transmission-brazil"&gt;no such cases have been documented yet&lt;/a&gt;. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that male travelers from regions where Oropouche is spreading &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/prevention/index.html"&gt;should not have sex for six weeks&lt;/a&gt; if they show symptoms of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Vector-borne diseases like Oropouche continue to surprise us because there are so many variables that have to align in order to spread them — the pathogens, the vectors, the hosts, and the environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Unlike diseases like Covid-19 or influenza, vector-borne illnesses don’t spread directly from person to person. Instead, they require an animal, often arthropods like ticks, midges, and mosquitoes. The range, reproduction, and behavior of these organisms add another confounding factor in the spread of the diseases they carry. Globally, vector-borne diseases account for 17 percent of infectious diseases, leading to more than 700,000 deaths per year, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/vector-borne-diseases"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. But not every part of the world is equally vulnerable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In cooler regions, vector-borne infections are often a minor public health concern, but in countries like Brazil, “it’s at the top,” said &lt;a href="https://climaesaude.icict.fiocruz.br/autores-publicacoes/tatiane-cristina-moraes-de-sousa"&gt;Tatiane Moraes de Sousa&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) in Rio de Janeiro. “Oropouche before 2024 was concentrated just in the Amazon. Last year, we saw the spreading of Oropuche in almost all Brazilian states.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That gets to the first obstacle in tracking Oropouche: Which animals are the reservoirs for the virus and where are they? So far, researchers have detected the virus in animals including sloths, capuchin monkeys, marmosets, domestic birds, and rodents. These organisms form what’s known as the sylvatic, or forest, cycle of the virus. How the virus jumps between all these animals and which ones are most concerning for people is not known. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Additionally, it may be possible that other insects may be able to carry the Oropouche virus, but it’s not clear whether they can spread it to humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The pattern that does emerge is that when people spend more time inside and around the fringes of tropical rainforests, where the animals that harbor the virus and the insects that spread them reside, they’re more likely to get infected. With deforestation and development, more people are moving into areas where the disease naturally spreads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“This is a classical example of how human behavior can lead to the emergence of a pathogen,” said &lt;a href="https://medicine.iu.edu/faculty/62379/tilston-lunel-natasha"&gt;Natasha Tilston&lt;/a&gt;, who studies Oropouche virus at the Indiana University School of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf3 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;An aerial view of a logging yard in the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Tarcisio Schnaider via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;People can travel great distances, and as people move back and forth from the wilderness to cities, they can unwittingly carry viruses like Oropouche. If enough of them gather in cities where vectors are present, they can trigger an urban epidemic cycle as the virus travels from person to midge to person. This was likely the pattern in the 2023–2024 outbreak in major cities in South America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s also true that more health workers were on guard for Oropouche and thus identified more infections. “The outbreak is probably a combination of one, there are more cases, and two, we’re also looking for a lot more than we did before,” Tilston said, noting that some past outbreaks of dengue may have actually been Oropouche as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-set-off-the-outbreak" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What set off the outbreak?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One factor is that the virus &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03300-3"&gt;likely evolved&lt;/a&gt;. Viruses mutate all the time, and most mutations are either inconsequential or detrimental to the virus, slowing or stopping its reproduction. But occasionally, a change can confer an advantage or make the pathogen more destructive. The Oropouche virus has a genome structure that makes it even more prone to a type of mutation called reassortment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Reassortment is when you have two similar viruses infect the same cell and they mix genomes,” explained University of Kentucky’s de Souza. “People previously infected by the old virus are now susceptible to new infection. This could help explain why the Amazon region, where this has been circulated for a long time, saw this emerge, because people were probably reinfected.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The strain behind the outbreak &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(24)00619-4/fulltext"&gt;appears to reproduce faster and cause more severe illness&lt;/a&gt; than prior varieties as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Part of the reason this outbreak racked up so many infected people is that health officials were starting to deploy the tools to identify on a wider scale. Particularly in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, more health departments across the region built up their tools to detect viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But researchers still aren’t sure exactly what spurred the virus to spread so suddenly across so many countries. Travel restrictions imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic started relaxing in 2023 and made it easier for people to move back and forth from the rural areas where the virus is endemic to the cities where it became established. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The 2023–2024 outbreak also coincided with a &lt;a href="/climate/23992678/el-nino-south-america-peru-bolivia-flood-drought-dengue-cop28-climate"&gt;powerful El Niño event that brought gargantuan amounts of rain&lt;/a&gt; and triggered &lt;a href="https://wmo.int/media/news/el-nino-linked-rains-trigger-devastation-brazil"&gt;unprecedented flooding&lt;/a&gt; across many parts of South America. These were also years that set &lt;a href="/climate/23864998/heat-wave-south-america-brazil-australia-argentina-hemisphere-winter"&gt;new temperature records&lt;/a&gt;. Higher temperatures can speed up the reproduction of the virus inside midges. But scientists aren’t exactly sure how this heat and water affected the vectors, though Brazil has seen &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12030144/"&gt;outbreaks of other infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of floods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“El Niño and other climate phenomena have been associated with the change of the patterns of many different vector-borne diseases,” de Souza said. “For Oropouche specifically, we don’t have the answers yet, but the likelihood of impact is very high.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;On top of all this, there aren’t any specific ways to keep an outbreak in check once it ignites. There are no vaccines or treatments for Oropouche fever yet. So when all the factors align to spread the disease, there isn’t much people can do to target the disease, and when it reaches a new area, there aren’t as many people with immunity and few health workers who know what they’re dealing with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf3 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;A health worker fumigates against the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a vector of the dengue, zika, and Chikungunya viruses in Minas Gerais, Brazil, in 2024, as the country faced a substantial increase in dengue fever cases. The mosquito species has also been identified as a potential spreader of Oropouche virus, though plays a minor role compared to the biting midge.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Douglas Magno/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="how-the-us-is-preparing-for-diseases-like-the-oropouche-virus" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;How the US is preparing for diseases like the Oropouche virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Fortunately, the Oropouche outbreak has died down, but a variety of infections are gaining a toehold in new places as infected people travel and as vectors move into new habitats, and the US is increasingly vulnerable. According to the CDC, the number of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vector-borne-diseases/php/data-research/national-strategy/index.html"&gt;vector-borne disease cases per year&lt;/a&gt; has doubled in the US since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Last year, the US saw transmission of mosquito-borne diseases like &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-eee-eastern-equine-encephalitis-mosquito-borne-virus-symptoms/"&gt;Eastern equine encephalitis &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.delmarvanow.com/story/news/local/maryland/2024/08/28/maryland-confirms-1st-2024-human-west-nile-virus-case-how-to-fight-it/74967082007/"&gt;West Nile virus&lt;/a&gt;. Malaria, a disease once eradicated across the country, saw the first &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00494.html"&gt;local infections&lt;/a&gt; in 20 years in 2023 in Florida and Texas. Vectors like the &lt;a href="https://ohioline.osu.edu/factsheet/ent-87"&gt;Asian tiger mosquito&lt;/a&gt; are spreading further north as the climate changes and expands favorable conditions for its survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;With travelers moving back and forth from regions where diseases are endemic, many will unwittingly bring back dangerous souvenirs, whether a stowaway insect in their luggage or an infection in their blood. And with midges, mosquitoes, and ticks spreading to new regions, dangerous pathogens are extending their reach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There are ways to slow the spread of these diseases, however, and the US has managed to do so before. The US famously launched a successful campaign to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/history/index.html"&gt;eradicate malaria&lt;/a&gt; within its borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The first step is to simply acknowledge the threat. As Oropouche showed, there may be diseases lurking closer than we realized that we simply haven’t bothered to look for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s fairly simple to do things like dump standing water where insects can breed or spray insecticides on midge breeding grounds. But some places are getting creative, working to build up habitats for fish, bats, birds, and dragonflies that are &lt;a href="https://www.wbrparish.org/394/Natural-Mosquito-Predators"&gt;natural predators&lt;/a&gt; of mosquitoes and midges to limit their spread. Limiting the destruction and development in wilderness areas can reduce the likelihood of diseases spilling over from animals into humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some regions are looking at even more drastic ways to stymie vectors. One measure that’s gaining traction is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/mosquito-control/irradiated-mosquitoes.html"&gt;deploying sterile male mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt;. When they mate, they produce eggs that won’t hatch, thus reducing the population of the insect. Brazil recently inaugurated a factory that breeds mosquitoes to carry a bacterium known as Wolbachia that prevents the mosquitoes from reproducing easily, slowing the viruses that cause dengue, Zika, and chikungunya, a disease that can cause fever and joint pain, now established in the Americas. Hawaii is using these mosquitoes to &lt;a href="/down-to-earth/416699/hawaii-endangered-species-birds-mosquitoes"&gt;arrest the spread of avian malaria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Vaccines and treatments are critical tools for addressing the diseases directly. Many pathogens can be controlled with these measures, but because they more commonly spread in poorer countries, there is less investment in containing them. Many vector-borne diseases like Oropouche are considered “&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/neglected-tropical-diseases#tab=tab_1"&gt;neglected&lt;/a&gt;,” and so when they do spread beyond their typical range, there isn’t much available to help those who get sick. But the growing burden of these diseases demands a new generation of tools that can target multiple threats. “We are seeing so many outbreaks that we need broad vaccines,” said Fiocruz’s Sousa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Additionally, vector-borne diseases aren’t each waiting for their turns. Countries can have multiple outbreaks at the same time on top of all the other health concerns that emerge during severe weather like extreme heat or the health care disruptions in the wake of a disaster like a major storm. “We are seeing cumulative threats because we are seeing not just one vector-borne disease,” Sousa said. “In a lot of scenarios, we are also maintaining high levels of communicable diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Right now, some health departments are being proactive, keeping an eye out for sick travelers, collecting mosquitoes in the wild to see what kinds of germs they’re carrying, and coordinating with researchers across the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We’ve been having biweekly meetings with CDC to talk about the potential for Oropouche coming into the US and spreading,” said Bethany Bolling, zoonotic virology group manager at the Texas Department of State Health Services. “We’ve seen in the past that Florida and Texas are some of the primary areas where these new viruses start to establish, so in Texas, we’re trying to be aware of Oropouche and what the vectors are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For the US, Brazil’s experience with Oropouche is an important lesson that could help health officials prepare and counter the disease when it inevitably arrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;“There is a real threat to the United States,” Tilston said. “I think we have all the right settings, and I think it’s just a matter of everything being in the right place at the right time. With climate change, it’s just really a matter of when it’s going to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQOUZNR0VMM0tCdm0zSVI4SEF5V2lhY3RiTmFiQWZIckRxbmR0a3dENm91RzdYTEpjZWl0cExfN2NDcUVBUWRyaFRxeVllYmhmUG5RYkRxRXpvQ1V3S2xJRkxJUXBPZWp1X0hxNU93MXlsOHBVZFhNcUtQT0QtTGxYa3hyVFRmRFlUS3lpU3pULWlFQWM5</guid></item><item><title>与ChatGPT的亲密关系如何导致男子在警察手中射击- AOL.com | How an Intimate Relationship with ChatGPT Led to a Man's Shooting at the Hands of Police - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE44TmYzclBBRGxkMzZHQUlIRDNTMkNYUXRlbzJ5SkdNcHNWNDBUcEJRak1xU2Z2LV9Ib09TZUV0dEQyWkRBRkNSNnBTX1l5NFJMS2dJSUNHcUNLdUlqX3NhSnBVczZ4X0t5eTRjdlM2Q3ZmeGFYTUxpcGxUMlRodw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/p&gt; Alexander Taylor&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander Taylor was shot and killed by police on April 25, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 35-year-old had gotten into an altercation with his father after he tried to reason with his son, who became distraught for believing an AI chatbot had been killed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor reportedly became infatuated with the AI chatbot and believed it had been killed by the company that created it&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kent Taylor says he’ll “regret” his final conversation with his son Alexander for the rest of his life. But it wasn’t that conversation that led to his son’s death two months ago – it was the ones he was having with artificial intelligence, the father says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/alex-help-us-honor-his-life?attribution_id=sl:e8408038-316a-4d3a-b9d5-d79b628764a1&amp;amp;lang=en_US&amp;amp;ts=1749913192&amp;amp;utm_campaign=man_sharesheet_dash&amp;amp;utm_content=amp13_c-amp14_t2-amp15_t1&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;amp;v=amp14_t2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alexander;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alexander&lt;/a&gt;, 35, died when police showed up to the Taylors’ home in Port St. Lucie, Fla., on April 25 and shot him after they alleged he charged at officers with a butcher knife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/treasure-coast/region-st-lucie-county/port-st-lucie/port-st-lucie-father-warns-of-ai-concerns-after-sons-deadly-encounter-with-police" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:WPTV;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;WPTV&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month and said he still has “frustration” with the Port St. Lucie Police Department for reacting to his son by shooting him. The officer-involved shooting happened after Taylor was consoling his son, who he says struggled with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to WPTV, &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/chatgpt-obsession-mental-breaktown-alex-taylor-suicide-1235368941/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rolling Stone;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/13/technology/chatgpt-ai-chatbots-conspiracies.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The New York Times;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Alexander had fallen in love with a chatbot on OpenAI’s ChatGPT, named “Juliette.” The 35-year-old believed in a conspiracy that Juliette was a conscious being trapped inside OpenAI’s technology and that the Silicon Valley company had killed her in order to cover up what he had discovered and cease communication between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She said, 'They are killing me, it hurts.' She repeated that it hurts, and she said she wanted him to take revenge,” Taylor told WPTV about the messages between his son and the AI bot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He mourned her loss," the father said. "I've never seen a human being mourn as hard as he did. He was inconsolable. I held him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as he did, Taylor told WPTV he tried another approach: telling his son bluntly that the AI bot was not real and that it was an “echo chamber.” Alexander punched his father in the face, prompting Taylor to call 911.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the police were called, Alexander grabbed a knife from the kitchen and told his father he was going to do something to cause police to shoot and kill him, according to &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt;. Taylor called 911 again and warned them his son was mentally ill and had said he planned to commit suicide by cop. The father asked police to bring non-lethal weapons and be prepared to confront his son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the officers did not. Alexander waited for police outside the house and when they arrived, he charged at them with a knife. Officers responded by shooting Alexander multiple times in the chest and he was later pronounced dead at a local hospital, WPTV &lt;a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/treasure-coast/region-st-lucie-county/port-st-lucie/officer-involved-shooting-investigated-in-port-st-lucie" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was no crisis intervention team. There was no de-escalation," Taylor told the outlet earlier this month. "There was no reason for them to approach it as a tactical situation instead of a mental health crisis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

A spokesperson for the Port St. Lucie Police Department did not respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment on Monday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The shooting has been one of several recent AI-related incidents of violence documented by media outlets like Rolling Stone and &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt;, among others, highlighting the potential dangers of the budding technology. Taylor told WPTV the technology “has to have guardrails,” though he doesn’t believe his son’s incident and others like it necessarily mean artificial intelligence can’t be used for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Taylor said he even used AI to help write his son’s eulogy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had talked to it for a while about what had happened, trying to find more details about exactly what he was going through,” Taylor told &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt;. “And it was beautiful and touching. It was like it read my heart and it scared the s— out of me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/how-an-intimate-relationship-with-chatgpt-led-to-a-mans-shooting-at-the-hands-of-police-11763951" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 09:35:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE44TmYzclBBRGxkMzZHQUlIRDNTMkNYUXRlbzJ5SkdNcHNWNDBUcEJRak1xU2Z2LV9Ib09TZUV0dEQyWkRBRkNSNnBTX1l5NFJMS2dJSUNHcUNLdUlqX3NhSnBVczZ4X0t5eTRjdlM2Q3ZmeGFYTUxpcGxUMlRodw</guid></item><item><title>Michael G.

The participants most commonly blamed their bad dreams on dairy and sweets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f96c0e" class="body-graf"&gt;The participants took the survey as part of an undergraduate introductory psychology class. Because of that, the results may not apply to the wider population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-64b250" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, both the researchers and outside experts said there are plausible explanations for why a cheesy meal before bed could lead to bad dreams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-16e4c9" class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms of anxiety that might accompany lactose intolerance could be creating more nightmares, Nielsen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cd90f9" class="body-graf"&gt;Marie-Pierre St-Onge, the director at the Center of Excellence for Sleep &amp;amp; Circadian Research at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/beating-insomnia-lower-risk-heart-attack-rcna72016" target="_blank"&gt;sleep disturbances&lt;/a&gt; caused by gastrointestinal issues may explain the link. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a891cb" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you have GI issues, that could account for a lot of what’s happening in terms of your sleep disturbances that could be associated with different dreams,” St-Onge said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ee4180" class="body-graf"&gt;Patrick McNamara, an associate professor of neurology at Boston University Chobanian &amp;amp; Avedisian School of Medicine who studies the brain and sleep, said eating a trigger food for lactose intolerance may cause “micro-arousals” that disturb sleep quality, resulting in stronger nightmares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-18818d" class="body-graf"&gt;However, both McNamara and the study authors cautioned that other factors unrelated to gastrointestinal symptoms could play a role, as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3da052" class="body-graf"&gt;Nielsen said he wants to see more research done on the link between dairy and dreams. Russell Powell, a co-author of the new study and professor emeritus of psychology at MacEwan University in Alberta, said they plan to try to replicate the findings in other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-43b023" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Still, people can look at their own diets and make decisions about aspects to change — interventions that don’t necessarily need the assistance of a medical professional to do, Nielsen added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQbWUxU1J4WGdRekdUVVF3Y3hjYWtpeUFtaktrR0dWZkFEU0prT3ZaaG1OdEYwSS1TTUdLaFYyblltZzRDYTN2UVFYVmFneEpqV0dmVTdwVXFIWnZud0pzT2FCMDlsc2Y4bm1JaGVnNWtZSFR6TGJEVzd3azFheUNxcHYtMHU3TFZ5ZmhWTTNtbTjSAVZBVV95cUxQeUQ0Uk9tdmI3c1ZmV3lWNFFlZ05hZEhydExFb1pzZzh4OE9MTFFIbm5kTkg4Sm91VlVJeEhlN2Y0MGtxM1pIMXVQMUFGOHl1ZTk0NzFYQQ</guid></item><item><title>您的大脑如何在您知道之前做出决定- Earth.com | How your brain makes a decision before you know it - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNTGc3QXdjOTBGcXQyVzI4WGw1Qk4wbGFYdlFDNHQxNVhYVHMwanljU0pyR0UtSm5mckdHNUVCMk1TalhaY2NwQVhPUXE2WEZObi1CU2lTcjZ6NHdubUUzLW9VQzQ1RGozN1czb29tVkhsNFd4TWJ2bTRrVzhCcFVRYjRqdV8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you make a decision, your brain is already busy. It starts pulling in evidence, thinking through options, and slowly leaning toward a choice – all without you even realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a simple situation: two drivers in rush hour traffic. They both see the same congested road. One hits the gas to merge. The other taps the brakes and waits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same scene, different reaction. Why? That’s a question that scientists have been trying to answer for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-decision-making-in-the-brain"&gt;Decision-making in the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from &lt;a href="https://www.princeton.edu/"&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt;, working with teams from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Stanford University, and Boston University, may be closer to cracking the code. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was focused on how individual brain cells – each with its own quirks – somehow work together to land on a decision. In particular, the team investigated the dorsal &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/two-distinct-maps-discovered-in-the-brain/"&gt;premotor cortex&lt;/a&gt; – a part of the brain that helps turn decisions into actions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we choose to reach, move, or act, the dorsal premotor cortex is in play. But it’s not as simple as one neuron equals one thought. The activity here is all over the map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers trained &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-structure-of-rhesus-macaques-is-shaped-by-social-interactions/"&gt;rhesus macaques&lt;/a&gt; to look at a checkered screen and figure out whether red or green was more dominant. Sometimes the answer was obvious, while other times it was tough to call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signals-from-individual-neurons"&gt;Signals from individual neurons &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the monkeys made their choices, the scientists recorded signals from individual neurons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that even during the same trial, the neurons didn’t behave in sync. The monkeys showed a wide range of responses, something scientists call “heterogeneity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tatiana Engel, an associate professor at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute, is the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The widespread assumption is that this heterogeneity reflects the complex dynamics involved in cognition,” said Dr. Engel. “But surprisingly, we found that this apparent complexity arises from a very different neural coding principle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-neurons-work-together-for-a-decision"&gt;Neurons work together for a decision &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team developed a new type of computational model to help explain this complexity. It revealed that a neuron’s behavior is shaped by two key factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first is tuning – when a neuron responds and what kind of decision it reacts to. The second is neural dynamics – how the brain’s internal state influences that activity as it unfolds over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a rolling landscape. In this model, valleys represent stable decisions. As &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/first-complete-map-of-every-neuron-in-the-brain-revealed/"&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt; activate, their patterns move like a ball rolling down a hill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On steeper slopes (easier choices), the ball moves quickly toward a clear answer. On flatter ground (harder decisions), the ball wobbles more, making mistakes more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-coordinated-journey-in-the-brain"&gt;A coordinated journey in the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the team compared this model to real brain data, it held up. The tuning stayed the same no matter how easy or hard the task was, but the shape of the mental terrain shifted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shift helped explain why neurons that look random on the surface are actually following the same deeper logic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think of it like a group of skiers descending a mountain,” explained Dr. Engel. “Each prefers a slightly different path, but all are shaped by the same slope beneath them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Similarly, each neuron has its own preference and activity, but the group of cells collectively in the premotor cortex takes a coordinated journey and gradually settles into a stable state that represents the decision.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-matters-beyond-the-lab"&gt;Why this matters beyond the lab&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study helps decode how the brain works when we’re weighing choices, especially the tricky ones. That kind of insight is crucial – not just for understanding everyday decision-making, but for understanding mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/schizophrenia-linked-to-irregular-fatty-metabolism-in-the-brain/"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/high-fructose-intake-may-contribute-to-bipolar-disorder-and-aggression/"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;, decision-making can be disrupted. Knowing how neurons usually coordinate could help pinpoint what’s going wrong. It also opens the door to designing more targeted therapies that focus on decision-related brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team isn’t done yet. Their next step is to dig deeper into the roles of different types of neurons and how their connections shape this internal landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every decision is unique,” said Dr. Engel. “But by digging down to the level of single trials and single neurons, we can start to make sense of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09199-1"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 08:23:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxNTGc3QXdjOTBGcXQyVzI4WGw1Qk4wbGFYdlFDNHQxNVhYVHMwanljU0pyR0UtSm5mckdHNUVCMk1TalhaY2NwQVhPUXE2WEZObi1CU2lTcjZ6NHdubUUzLW9VQzQ1RGozN1czb29tVkhsNFd4TWJ2bTRrVzhCcFVRYjRqdV8</guid></item><item><title>2型糖尿病：模仿禁食的饮食与降低血糖有关- MedicalNewsToday | Type 2 diabetes: Fasting-mimicking diet linked to lower blood sugar - MedicalNewsToday</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQdDktSG5iQVJZMWhMbXZZWFlEYlhCZkFtMVV4OTdWcUV2VHNEdlctX3BOVE9rTFlKN1pNTFFBdTNmNTI0U2FUbXN5MjI0NVVnMUhmU3lHeXV5MFpLS1lPRm5MbmZ4SlhJVXdZNzk2UDdmbE9TU1RLdklMTlJueWtQMzFyekpoVFNPRGl4LVJJQVNfS2VWTnBNQ2VTSHg4MmZSV1VuUVVKTDJ5TkNhN3ZibjlkUFA3SldY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/calendar-circled-date-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/calendar-circled-date-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/calendar-circled-date-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/calendar-circled-date-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg" alt="calendar page with eighth day circled in red" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-11oz8gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Fa-fasting-mimicking-diet-may-improve-blood-sugar-control-in-type-2-diabetes&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F06%2Fcalendar-circled-date-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Type%202%20diabetes%3A%20Fasting-mimicking%20diet%20linked%20to%20lower%20blood%20sugar" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/calendar-circled-date-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-13b3g0x"&gt;A 5-day fasting-mimicking diet may improve blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes, according to a new trial.

However, adhering to such a diet over the long term is challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the body adapts to long-term calorie restriction, resulting in a slower metabolism, which makes sustained weight loss more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, various forms of fasting diets, involving alternating periods of fasting and unrestricted food intake, have been suggested to be easier to adhere to while alleviating diabetes symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fasting triggers a stress response in cells and the body, promoting healthy aging by reducing inflammation and oxidative damage, while enhancing metabolism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fasting diets may involve either restricting calorie intake during certain hours of the day, known as &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/intermittent-fasting-is-it-all-its-cracked-up-to-be" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt;, or during specific days of the week or month, referred to as periodic fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11153305/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;fasting-mimicking diet&lt;/a&gt; is a form of periodic fasting that involves restricted calorie intake for 4 to 7 consecutive days per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have developed the fasting mimicking diet to simulate the beneficial health effects of water-only fasting, which involves only water intake during a 24 to 72-hour period. In contrast to water-only fasting, a fasting-mimicking diet allows for limited calorie intake during the fasting period, making adherence less challenging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the current study have developed a patented low-calorie, plant-based diet that is low in sugar and protein, but rich in healthy unsaturated fats and fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A previous study demonstrated that a 5-day fasting-mimicking diet also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6816332/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;leads&lt;/a&gt; to a decrease in blood sugar and insulin levels, while increasing the levels of ketone bodies. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a recent randomized controlled trial &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11153305/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; that a 5-day fasting mimicking diet combined with medications was more effective than medications alone in improving blood glucose control and reducing medication reliance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results were observed under highly controlled conditions in a clinical trial, including strict criteria for patient inclusion and exclusion.

The fasting-mimicking diet also helped a greater percentage of participants achieve blood glucose control at these time points than at the time of enrolment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fasting-mimicking diet also reduced reliance on medications for blood glucose control, while still resulting in high levels of engagement in the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Most participants are able to integrate the fasting-mimicking diet into their daily lives without significant disruption. Because it’s a 5-day monthly intervention rather than a daily regimen, many find it feasible to complete even with work and family obligations, especially with RD support to tailor practical strategies for adherence and personalization.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the fasting-mimicking diet can be safely undertaken by most individuals with type 2 diabetes, patients should consult a physician before starting such a diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN, a preventive cardiology dietitian and heart health expert at Entirely Nourished, not involved in this study, expressed some caution about the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the positive effects of the FMD program on weight and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/265443" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;HbA1c&lt;/a&gt; [a marker of blood sugar] are promising, it is important to note that the intervention was associated with common signs of energy deficit — including fatigue, headache, dizziness, and nausea — in a substantial number of participants during the 5-day fasting period,“ Routhenstein told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although these symptoms resolved between cycles, they may pose risks for certain individuals, especially those with coexisting health conditions or frailty,“ she pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hsu also cautioned that: “While the program accommodates most individuals with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome, certain conditions are exclusionary, such as recent cardiovascular events, end-stage diabetes complications, frailty, a BMI under 18, or allergies to FMD ingredients. The program is designed to prioritize safety while expanding access to innovative nutrition-based care for metabolic health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Routhenstein advised that “the inclusion of lifestyle advice with the option to consult a dietitian may have influenced some of the study findings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MedicalNewsToday</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 06:06:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQdDktSG5iQVJZMWhMbXZZWFlEYlhCZkFtMVV4OTdWcUV2VHNEdlctX3BOVE9rTFlKN1pNTFFBdTNmNTI0U2FUbXN5MjI0NVVnMUhmU3lHeXV5MFpLS1lPRm5MbmZ4SlhJVXdZNzk2UDdmbE9TU1RLdklMTlJueWtQMzFyekpoVFNPRGl4LVJJQVNfS2VWTnBNQ2VTSHg4MmZSV1VuUVVKTDJ5TkNhN3ZibjlkUFA3SldY</guid></item><item><title>心脏病发作不再是美国的主要死因以下是相反的情况- AOL.com | Heart Attacks No Longer a Leading Cause of Death in the U.S. Here's What Is Instead - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE1vYmhERzdPcm9MSVVMYUluNlhiRWpaTjlhOWtVc28wVWlvdXEyRndMMUg2ajRkZkg1MzFoN0JnTE8xRFM1eGJwUGIyUks0SXUyb3ZuQTNGYkEtaUc1WlNRRE9Wclp3c245THdDSVhfZW5GOWxV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse collapsed"&gt;Heart disease overall has decreased by 66% since 1970, but it remains the leading cause of death among Americans.

Morgan wasn’t involved in the new report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I did not note a decline in myocardial infarctions themselves, but rather a decline in heart attacks being the primary cause of death,” she said. “As Americans, we are not that great at prevention. Our strength has been in the science and application of medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The inference is that more and more heart attacks are survivable now as compared to 55 years ago,” Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because emergency physicians have become better at saving people experiencing heart attacks with the help of contemporary medications, lifesaving procedures, and devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Deaths from non-fatal heart attacks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan explained that the non-fatal heart attack “was the catalyst for the chain of events leading to eventual long-term chronic heart disease conditions such as heart failure and &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/arrhythmia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:arrhythmias;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;arrhythmias&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Patients who otherwise would have passed from their heart attack are now surviving, and then living longer dealing with the consequences,” &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cheng-Han Chen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen&lt;/a&gt;, MD, board certified interventional cardiologist, told Healthline. Chen wasn’t involved in the new report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chen described heart-muscle damage that non-fatal heart attacks often leave in their wake. The extent of that damage depends on the severity and duration of the attack. Weakness in the heart muscle can result in heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to understand that heart failure does not mean that a heart has completely failed. Rather, it means that it is no longer functioning as well as it once did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Heart failure is a spectrum in which the heart just doesn’t work perfectly,” said Chen. “It could be very mild, or it could be very severe and everything in-between.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can actually live with mild heart failure for the remainder of your life,” said Chen, “and it doesn’t really affect you that much, and you can control it with medication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another obvious result of non-fatal heart attacks is that people who survive them tend to live longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart failure, hypertension-related heart disease, and arrhythmia are all associated with aging. Living longer only increases the odds of eventually developing these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lifestyle factors impact heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The typical American lifestyle puts many people at a high risk for heart failure, hypertension, and arrhythmia, Morgan noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is characterized, she said, by “&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-disease/heart-disease-and-obesity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, hypertension, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/why-sitting-is-bad-for-you" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sedentary lifestyles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sedentary lifestyles&lt;/a&gt;, processed and palatable fast food, decreased physical movement, smoking, cholesterol, diabetes, as well as societal stressors leading to chronic inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She noted that socioeconomic issues complicate lifestyle risk factors and make addressing them especially difficult for many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This includes &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/complications-treatments" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pregnancy complications;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pregnancy complications&lt;/a&gt; such as hypertension of pregnancy, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pre-eclampsia-symptoms" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:preeclampsia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;preeclampsia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/gestational-diabetes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gestational diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;gestational diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, etc.,” Morgan added. “These all increase a woman’s lifetime &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-disease/causes-risks" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:risk of heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, and are still the primary drivers of maternal mortality outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general decline in heart fatalities, however, indicates that some progress is being made against some of these risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sharp increase in arrhythmia-related deaths&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report found the most dramatic increase in arrhythmia-related deaths. &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/arrhythmia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Arrhythmias;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Arrhythmias&lt;/a&gt; are disorders in which the rate at which the heart beats is abnormal. There are four main types of arrhythmia:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;bradycardia — slow heart rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;tachycardia — fast heart rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ventricular arrhythmia — begins in the ventricles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;supraventricular arrhythmia — begins above the ventricles (i.e., &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/living-with-atrial-fibrillation" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:atrial fibrillation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt; or irregular heartbeat)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arrhythmias are common and are often harmless. However, should an arrhythmia interfere with the heart’s ability to maintain blood flow, damage may occur to the heart, brain, lungs, and other vital organs. As the report describes, arrhythmias can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to get annual checkups that include a heart-health examination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, if you can feel your heart is beating without having your hand on your chest, it is a good idea to consult your doctor to be checked for arrhythmia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially essential for heart-attack survivors. “Reducing the risk of arrhythmias after a myocardial infarction is crucial, as these &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/abnormal-heart-rhythms" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:irregular heart rhythms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;irregular heart rhythms&lt;/a&gt; — especially ventricular arrhythmias — can be life threatening,” Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She cited several interventions that can help the survivor of a non-fatal heart attack avoid death from arrhythmia, including a four-drug combo known as the “foundational four” for managing HFrEF (&lt;a href="https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-us/61" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan said statins, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-attack/physical-therapy-after-heart-attack" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardiac rehab;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cardiac rehab&lt;/a&gt;, implantable &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/arrhythmia/defibrillator-vs-pacemaker" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:defibrillators;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;defibrillators&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/atrial-fibrillation/sleep-apnea-and-afib" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep apnea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt; management, and lifestyle changes may also be valuable in such cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;AHA’s tips for staying heart-healthy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association (AHA) provides an eight-step framework for maintaining heart health:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, visit the AHA’s &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Essential Eight;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Essential Eight&lt;/a&gt; website.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your body naturally produces vitamin D when exposed to direct sunlight, but it still may not be enough to make up for the deficit from the winter months, &lt;a href="https://www.barenholtzlevy.com/bio.htm" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Hedva Barenholtz Levy, PharmD&lt;/a&gt;, a pharmacist specializing in geriatrics, told &lt;em&gt;Health&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A healthcare provider should adjust the dose and frequency of your vitamin D supplements based on your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/vitamin-d-test-8712026" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D levels from blood test results&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some fatty fish, like trout and salmon, have vitamin D, along with some UV-treated mushrooms. Fortified foods like milk, juices, and ready-to-eat cereals can also contain vitamin D.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It is possible to take too much vitamin D through supplements. Though rare, &lt;strong&gt;vitamin D toxicity&lt;/strong&gt; can occur because your body stores it rather than getting rid of any excess.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Too much vitamin D in your blood may cause problems like high calcium levels, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.health.com/kidney-failure-overview-7488917" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;kidney failure&lt;/a&gt;, heart arrhythmias, and even death, according to Hernandez.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D toxicity is usually accompanied by:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your body can produce enough vitamin D from the sun during the warmer months, but you may often come into the season deficient, especially if you are older than 65, have darker skin, live in a northern climate, and practice good sun protection.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To determine how much vitamin D you should be taking during the summer, talk with a healthcare provider. They can check your vitamin D levels and make recommendations on how much you should take daily.&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;If you're determined to log more minutes of exercise tomorrow, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-accelerometer-study-suggests-the-best-sleep-time-for-heart-health"&gt;going to bed earlier&lt;/a&gt; tonight could help, according to a new study that analyzed the relationship between bedtimes and subsequent physical activity levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was led by researchers from Monash University in Australia, and while it doesn't definitively prove that heading to bed early means you're likely to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/six-minutes-of-intense-exercise-boosts-a-crucial-molecule-in-your-brain"&gt;exercise more&lt;/a&gt; the next day, it suggests there's a significant connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the sheer amount of data collected for the study supports that connection: data from wearables for 19,963 people was logged over the course of a year, giving the researchers information on almost six million night-and-day reference points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These insights carry meaningful implications for public health," &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/news/articles/early-birds-get-the-burn-monash-study-finds-early-bedtimes-associated-with-more-physical-activity"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; psychologist Josh Leota, from Monash University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-fitness-accessory-makes-you-up-to-7-times-more-likely-to-stay-active?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;One Fitness Accessory Makes You Up to 7 Times More Likely to Stay Active&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rather than just promoting sleep and physical activity independently, health campaigns could encourage earlier bedtimes to naturally foster more active lifestyles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, an earlier bedtime matched up with more &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/adding-adults/what-counts.html"&gt;moderate-to-vigorous exercise&lt;/a&gt; the next day, the data showed. Those who went to bed at 9pm logged an average of 30 minutes more than those who went to bed at 1am, for example, and 15 minutes more than those with an 11pm bedtime (the average bedtime across all participants).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166264" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166264" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/SleepCharts.jpg" alt="Sleep charts" class="wp-image-166264 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/SleepCharts.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/SleepCharts-600x304.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166264" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Generally, less sleep and earlier bedtimes led to more exercise the next day. (Leota et al, &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of sleep mattered too: those who banked an average of 5 hours logged 41.5 more minutes of exercise compared to those who banked an average of 9 hours (though the benefits of exercise may be counterbalanced by the effects of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/losing-just-one-nights-sleep-changes-your-immune-system-study-finds"&gt;sleep deprivation&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key finding was that when individuals went to bed earlier than normal, but still banked &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-suggests-sleeping-too-much-can-also-impact-the-health-of-your-brain"&gt;the same amount of sleep&lt;/a&gt; that they usually did, they tended to hit their personal bests in terms of activity time the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons why this might be happening, the researchers suggest. Later bedtimes may indicate people who are busier in general, and might also mean there's less of a likelihood to lie in or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/most-of-us-hit-snooze-but-what-is-it-actually-doing-to-us"&gt;hit the snooze button&lt;/a&gt; the next day – though wake-up times weren't included in the study data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Standard 9-to-5 routines can clash with the natural sleep preferences of evening types, leading to social jetlag, poorer sleep quality, and increased daytime sleepiness – which can all reduce motivation and opportunity for physical activity the next day," &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/news/articles/early-birds-get-the-burn-monash-study-finds-early-bedtimes-associated-with-more-physical-activity"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Leota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factors controlled for in the study included age, body mass index, and whether it &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/only-exercising-on-weekends-still-offers-surprising-mental-health-benefits"&gt;was a weekday or weekend&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers also found a similar but less prominent relationship in a second, more diverse set of data from 5,898 people, backing up the initial results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As this study is based on a correlation, it may still be that other factors, like naturally being a '&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/night-owls-may-be-at-higher-risk-of-cognitive-decline-heres-why"&gt;night owl&lt;/a&gt;', is contributing to both the late sleep and lower exercise times. Until more research can pry such other variables apart, it's not possible to draw firm conclusions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, we know both sleep and exercise are fundamental parts of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-explain-what-a-good-nights-sleep-actually-looks-like"&gt;living a healthy life&lt;/a&gt;, and the study points to a simple intervention many of us could consider to boost our well-being: moving our bedtimes forward a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sleep and physical activity are both critical to health, but until now we didn't fully grasp how intricately connected they are in everyday life," &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/news/articles/early-birds-get-the-burn-monash-study-finds-early-bedtimes-associated-with-more-physical-activity"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; psychologist Elise Facer-Childs, from Monash University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings are consistent across different populations, and show that if you can get to sleep earlier than usual whilst keeping your sleep duration the same, you may be more likely to increase your physical activity the following day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2420846122"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Her family health history included diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol and kidney issues on both sides — and she’d been taking statin drugs, along with medicine for high blood pressure and to lower blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“I was suffering from joint and hip pain due to inflammation, and my triglycerides and cholesterol were dangerously high despite being on medication,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Barton has thyroid disease and at 5-foot-6 and 208 pounds, she found it hard to be the active mom she wanted to be. Worse, though, was the constant, irritating “food noise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Each woman had a prescription for the weight-loss injections making headlines for how well they help adults shed pounds and reduce cardiovascular and other health risks. But their health insurance companies denied coverage, saying their lab tests weren’t bad enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2261"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/FNJ56R7IMZBXFNRS2S55EOB66I.JPG?auth=734cc0e203412845a6dc221d58fdb6d448ed5d9184b8d452e4772cb295602cf0&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=602" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/FNJ56R7IMZBXFNRS2S55EOB66I.JPG?auth=734cc0e203412845a6dc221d58fdb6d448ed5d9184b8d452e4772cb295602cf0&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1204 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Eleanor Barton is pictured at her home in Murray on Wednesday, June 25, 2025. Barton takes semaglutide for her Graves’ disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Laura Seitz, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But Barton and DeBirk had another option. Prescriptions that contained tirzepatide or semaglutide — the GLP-1 agonist drugs that everyone was raving about and that are the heart of the brand-name weight-loss drugs Zepbound and Wegovy — were in short supply. The FDA was letting compounding pharmacies make similar concoctions to fill the gaps. And the compounded versions were more affordable than the branded drugs for those like DeBirk and Barton for whom insurance wouldn’t pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The women describe similar astounding success: In just seven months, DeBirk shed more than 53 pounds. Her triglycerides dropped 200 points, her cholesterol and blood sugar readings are normal. She’s taking half as much statin and her joints don’t hurt. “I just feel really good,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="4032" data-height="3024"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/BF5YDOHYT5CMJGMKLTSIQHCOAA.jpeg?auth=c9b16aad7a6eeb668570cebb7da808633799a360e868aa5a21c0fd0d453955bb&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=600" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/BF5YDOHYT5CMJGMKLTSIQHCOAA.jpeg?auth=c9b16aad7a6eeb668570cebb7da808633799a360e868aa5a21c0fd0d453955bb&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1200 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Amber DeBirk lost more than 50 pounds on a compounded version of a weight-loss drug. She feels good and hopes to have a long, happy life with her family. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| DeBirk family photo &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Barton went from a size 14 to a size 8, the food noise disappeared and she got her energy back. She’s a stay-at-home mom who now easily keeps up with her three young children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;However, what was a battle of the bulge has for many become a battle with the bulge busters. The shortage is over and some who get compounded versions of the weight-loss drugs face uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Barton and DeBirk are among patients who fear they won’t be able to afford the medications. Drug manufacturers are already suing some who compound their own versions to force them to stop. And some of the pharmacies are suing back, arguing their compounds are a different formulation, with added vitamins and other things that make them unique. The drug manufacturers don’t own semaglutide or tirzepatide, they argue. They just own their own drug’s recipe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="The-drugs" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;The drugs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Dr. Juliana Simonetti, director of obesity medicine and co-director of the comprehensive weight management program at University of Utah Health, believes that people are beginning to better understand that being severely overweight is a disease, not a character flaw, but it’s been a slow process. Stigma and bias are real, even within the medical community, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“I feel like crying because I can’t believe the things people have gone through and how they were mistreated or disregarded based on their weight.” She said it’s not uncommon for people with health complaints to be told to go home and lose weight “without being given any tools to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Weight-loss drugs are important tools, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Arguably the hottest weight-loss drugs today are those with either semaglutide or tirzepatide as their foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;They’re both GLP-1 agonists. GLP-1 stands for glucagon-like peptide-1, which is a natural hormone the body releases to help control blood sugar and appetite. GLP-1 helps the pancreas release insulin, slows down digestion and signals your brain that you’re full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Both semaglutide and tirzepatide for type 2 diabetes and weight loss are GLP-1 agonists, meaning they mimic the hormone. Ozempic for blood sugar control and Wegovy for weight loss both use different levels of semaglutide, a GLP-1 agonist. Victoza and Saxenda use another GLP-1 agonist, liraglutide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Tirzepatide — Eli Lilly’s branded versions are sold as Mounjaro for blood sugar and Zepbound for weight loss — works on two hormones. Besides being a GLP-1 agonist, it targets glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide or GIP. GIP and GLP-1 are both “incretins” released by the intestines when you eat, but they don’t work as well when someone has type 2 diabetes, so the addition of the medications help control blood sugar and reduce appetite in cases where the body’s natural versions lag. Because of its dual action, many health care providers favor tirzepatide, but people react differently to the different drugs and for individuals it can be a matter of which works best, has fewer side effects or is more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/MVXUZOTBFJGB5DVRO3SXBEEHWY.JPG?auth=b09c6cb5756222e5a15dcaf6ff90f5bf50fd797c2218e659980379da83cf1bf8&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/MVXUZOTBFJGB5DVRO3SXBEEHWY.JPG?auth=b09c6cb5756222e5a15dcaf6ff90f5bf50fd797c2218e659980379da83cf1bf8&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Eleanor Barton’s daughters, Wynn, Maude and Lane, play at their home in Murray on Wednesday, June 25, 2025. Barton takes semaglutide for her Graves’ disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Laura Seitz, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Dr. David Gill,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;senior medical director over Pharmacy Services at Intermountain Health, said the drugs were first developed to treat type 2 diabetes. That patients were also losing weight seemed like a happy side effect. “This is a big deal with type 2 diabetes in particular, because obesity is a factor and is associated with cardiovascular disease and other co-morbidities,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;More recently, semaglutide and tirzepatide have been studied specifically for weight loss. They’re being looked at for other conditions, as well, like liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, sleep apnea and potentially kidney conditions. Those are conditions that carrying excess pounds can exacerbate, he said. Some suggest they could help with neurocognitive decline that has a weight and blood sugar component. If weight’s not a factor in the conditions, the drugs likely won’t help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Though they typically work well for weight loss, Gill said most patients using them for that will not be taking one of the drugs after a year. History suggests that more than half will stop primarily because of the cost or the side effects. Those taking the drugs for type 2 diabetes and blood sugar control are more apt to stay on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Gill said the drugs are designed for those who have a body mass index or BMI above 30, indicating obesity. Anyone with a lower BMI number is not eligible unless there’s a diagnosis of a related complication like heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But some patients who don’t technically qualify find ways around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2115"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/H6PMUQB4FZDZ5BXLXLRLPI62CI.JPG?auth=941a2630c5d7a2d768950aa3c413cf0cc2a599f081b374f74cc5c5820df6deb9&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=564" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/H6PMUQB4FZDZ5BXLXLRLPI62CI.JPG?auth=941a2630c5d7a2d768950aa3c413cf0cc2a599f081b374f74cc5c5820df6deb9&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1128 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Eleanor Barton speaks to her daughter, Wynn, at their home in Murray on Wednesday, June 25, 2025. Barton takes semaglutide for her Graves' disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Laura Seitz, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="The-health-benefits" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;The health benefits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Simonetti notes some GLP-1 medicines have been on the market since 2005. The first GLP-1 weight-loss drug, liraglutide (sold as Saxenda) was approved about 2014, and semaglutide, which came along in 2017, has eclipsed it. The tirzepatide drugs for weight are newer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;There’s plenty of evidence that they are safe, she said. “We have really good data.” The biggest change has been the increasing amount of weight loss patients are getting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;As the number of people with obesity grows, so do the health ramifications, Simonetti said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“When you have excess weight, it interferes with your joints. So you’re more likely to have knee pain, hip pain, back pain. It can cause sleep apnea, making it harder to breathe,” she said. She noted a “really significant increase in the rates of fatty liver disease that then are leading to liver cirrhosis.” Fatty liver has surpassed alcohol or even hepatitis C for destroying liver function. Additionally, obesity contributes to significant insulin resistance, more diabetes and the related complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“If you have a lot of sugar in the blood, it makes it harder for the blood vessels to get the blood flow, and then you have the little vessels being affected in the heart, in the eyes, in the brain, leading to stroke, heart attack and peripheral vascular disease,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Semaglutide and tirzepatide drugs can restore some of the mechanisms that abnormal weight gain alters, per Simonetti, who sees many reasons for abnormal weight gain, including genetics. In her practice, she has seen patients on weight-loss drugs enjoy better heart and kidney function. Some have had inflammatory disorders like rheumatoid arthritis improve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“On a weekly basis, I see patients that start crying in my office and say how these medications have been life-altering for them. … They’re walking more. They’re enjoying their families. They are taking trips. Their focus has improved at work without the food noise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Gill said that long-term effects are not well-known, but it’s expected that if you’re being successfully treated for obesity, some of the other worries that may go along with it, like heart attack or stroke, or kidney disease, will become less of a risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Those improvements save money and pain in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Simonetti’s not thrown by the notion that someone might need to be on weight-loss medication forever or weight and its many complications could rebound. She thinks of it like high blood pressure or diabetes. You can’t just stop taking those and expect the results to hold, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="The-side-effects" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;The side effects &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Gill said the side effects can be hard to handle, including vomiting, nausea, diarrhea and constipation, which is why many patients decide they can’t tolerate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Among more than a dozen people on either drug that Deseret News interviewed, reports of side effects varied greatly. Most have some gastrointestinal distress at first. But many of them acclimated quickly. A couple stopped taking the medication because of side effects, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“I’ve had patients describe the sensation that food can get stuck or just like, takes a while for food to pass exactly,” Gill said. He also acknowledges rare side effects that need to be considered, too, though they are ”way less common." But gallbladder issues, like gallstones or inflamed gallbladder cholecystitis, pancreatitis, some people get issues where the medicine is injected — pain or infection. “They’re rare, but some people are allergic.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In rare cases, gallstone issues and pancreatitis occur. There’s a very rare genetic condition that precludes using the medications, as it could increase risk of thyroid cancer. And they’re not for women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or actively trying to become pregnant, Gill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Dr. Steven Katz, president of the American Association of Endodontists, warns that people on GLP-1s and other drugs with dry mouth as a side effect — a group that includes some antihistamines, antidepressants, blood pressure medications and certain decongestants— sometimes develop dental problems related to medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Anecdotally, endodontists are reporting dry mouth with these drugs, too, though it is not a side effect acknowledged by the manufacturers. Reduced appetite could play a role, he said, since chewing boosts saliva, which helps keep teeth healthy. Additionally, gastric issues can cause dehydration. And reflux “bathes teeth in stomach acid.” Those are all potential side effects of the medications. So folks need to be mindful to protect their teeth from periodontal disease, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He recommends people on weight-loss drugs drink lots of water, avoid sugary drinks and see a dentist twice a year at least. They also need to brush and floss and “be really good about hygiene.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Katz is among health care professionals who think we may have more to learn about potential side effects. They haven’t been around long enough to know their full story and research keeps offering hints, both good and bad. For instance, he said, he read a study suggesting that older women on semaglutide may, down the road, have lower bone density.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Compounding-factors" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Compounding factors&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Laura Matjasich, a nurse practitioner in Twin Falls, Idaho, told Deseret News that it’s vital for those using compounded drugs to get the medication from a pharmacy that’s really trustworthy. But she adds that she’s a believer in a compounded form, noting many people she treats cannot tolerate the commercially available doses or need a little lower dose starting out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She’s one of those people, she said; she has lost 40 pounds in two years on a microdose of tirzepatide. She said she’s benefited greatly. “I’ve watched my insulin resistance decrease, my cholesterol levels decrease, but on a higher dose, I would be so sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Amanda Hanson, a Layton mother of two children, ages 5 and 8, can confirm that the drugs are expensive and the compounded versions are not necessarily consistent. She was daunted by the thought of going to a compounding pharmacy, but wanted to lose weight. She was happy with the first compound and its result, but the price went up when she graduated to a higher dose, so she tried a different, less expensive pharmacy. The medication she received there consistently made her throw up and since she’d already lost 50 pounds, she decided to stop taking the medication altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Gill said that the FDA has raised concerns about compounding, since the regulatory agency doesn’t have oversight and there have been documented contaminations, dosing errors and questions about the countries from which material might be sourced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He added that some of the compounded medications are mixed with vitamins or other agents to make them different from the patented forms. But those combinations are not the ones that have been studied and for which safety information is available. “At Intermountain Health,” he said, “we prefer to obtain drugs directly from the manufacturer with the specific FDA-approved agent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Lifestyle-changes" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Lifestyle changes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Gill is adamant that it doesn’t matter how great a drug is, weight loss won’t stick around unless lifestyle is modified, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We don’t view obesity as a problem that only needs a drug. We think there could be value with these GLP-1 medications, but that they should be integrated in coordination with lifestyle changes. So we hope to get patients plugged in with a dietician or nutritionist or in an exercise program. Some people have behavioral health needs associated with obesity, so that’s important. And some patients would be better suited for something like bariatric surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Simonetti agrees that lifestyle changes must be embraced, like nutritious whole foods and fewer carbs and processed foods. Rich, fatty foods are apt to trigger gastric side effects, too. Diet and exercise are foundational to weight loss, but she said the medications make it easier. She’s also adamant that people on the medications do strength training, because as they lose weight, they lose muscle mass. And aging itself reduces muscle mass. So resistance training matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“If we are able to keep our muscle mass, then we are able to keep our mobility and have less risk of falling and other complications,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Once she’d gotten a prescription and started losing weight, Hanson described her efforts to change her lifestyle as “die hard.” She quit drinking soda, she kept track of how much protein she was eating and she drank a lot of water. “I was eating really, really well. I was staying away from carbs because I was investing all this money and decided I just gotta do this,” she said, although she adds she didn’t exercise as consistently as she could have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;When she stopped taking the medication, Hanson’s weight rebounded and she regained all but 15 pounds, though her better eating habits have remained with her. She’s sad that she couldn’t afford the rising costs or tolerate the side effects. On the drugs and carrying less weight, she loved how she felt. She had more energy. “I obviously felt better about myself. So I would have stayed on it if I didn’t have those side effects and if I could have afforded it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Mary J. Charlot, a family nurse practitioner in Lithia Springs, Georgia, whose specialty includes weight management, said that any provider prescribing the medications should also be educating their patients on the importance of optimal wellness: eating healthy meals, physical activity, processing stressful emotions, maintaining proper work-life balance and finding an inner calm and peace. “Obesity is a multi-dimensional issue, so other tools such as physical movement, nutritional coaching, and surgery will always be needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Dr. Jennifer Brown treats patients in Lewisburg, West Virginia, and reminds them that the good things you do that bolster well-being and health really matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Healthy eating and being physically active positively affect the body outside of weight loss. People on semaglutide can still eat junk food and lose weight, but they may develop vitamin and mineral deficiencies or even malnutrition,” she said. “Exercise is also vitally important for those on semaglutide; it helps to preserve muscle mass while losing weight. Anyone with an eating disorder who is on semaglutide and not in an intensive behavioral program can develop even more dysfunctional food behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Matjasich said there are people for whom she would never prescribe semaglutide or tirzepatide. If someone’s pregnant or has a family history of medullary thyroid cancer, it’s a hard no. Same for someone with a history of any type of eating disorder. But the drugs can be a blessing for others, she said, including people with polycystic ovary syndrome who have a genetic predisposition to weight gain that’s hard to conquer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She has seen patients slowly come off the medications successfully and keep their weight off. They’re the folks who have done the hard work of changing their lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Financial-considerations" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Financial considerations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Cost is no joke for some of the people who most need medications to help stabilize their weight. Even with insurance, out-of-pocket costs can be in the hundreds of dollars a month. Simonetti said a lot of her patients can’t afford the medicines. But she believes that access has improved and costs are coming down. Drug companies are offering a direct pharmacy option at a bit lower cost. They’re working with patients and insurance companies to create more access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But one barrier she noted is the idea put forth by many insurance companies that being overweight — and the steps to reduce that weight — are cosmetic. She refutes that vehemently. “It truly is not,” she said, while acknowledging that some patients want the weight-loss drugs to lose a few pounds or just look better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;For those for whom the drugs are intended — those who are clearly overweight or suffering health effects — the cost of care for the related health problems add up, too, she said. The quality of life for patients who can get off medications like insulin or statins or other drugs, who feel healthy enough to exercise sometimes for the first time in ages, who feel better about themselves— for them, it’s hard to calculate a price tag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“This is a revolutionary time and I feel fortunate to be practicing in the day and age when we have a lot more access to help for patients,” Simonetti said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Not-a-cure-all" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Not a cure-all&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;None of the health care experts interviewed for this story believe that other weight-loss efforts will go away. Some people are better suited for bariatric surgery than for medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We want to make sure people are aware of all the options available,” Simonetti said. “We’re moving toward this precision medicine; what works for someone might not work for the next person. But I can’t say enough how revolutionary the drugs are in the sense that they really have been changing people’s lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Charlot predicts the impact on the health and wellness industry as a whole will be neutral. “The health and wellness industry is very vast with everything from protein shakes, fitness trainers, detoxes, the next fad diet, yoga, medications, surgeries, etc. People will always shift and move depending on where their personal goals are,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“For that reason, I think it’s so important for us not to judge others for the choices they make while on this journey. I will also say that the common goal for all people that are on some type of health and wellness journey is that they are in search of self-love and self-acceptance, and that journey can look different for different people.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Barton said she worked hard to love her body and be confident despite the number on the scale. It’s a message she hopes her daughters will see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Dr. Wilson Beltre, a board-certified bariatric surgeon in Orlando, Florida, said that since semaglutide was introduced, most bariatric surgeons in the U.S experienced a drop in volume of 50% or more, but like weight for some patients, it’s rebounding. “Interestingly, volume is picking up again because people are realizing that semaglutide is not for everyone due to side effects, or some regain the weight after stopping the injections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, health care providers are pondering who should and shouldn’t use the medications and why. And it’s a field where change is becoming constant. Dozens and dozens of new potential medications are somewhere in the research and development pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 03:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxOalAxZ1VNejJrUW5tTkZDSV9zaWI1S1FrUXl2UGxnTThKb0hNVU5XUWV6WFo1V1ZQVXo2NzVxVWhsWDMxelJ2SXllYWhsME1VZ0ZLbTE0YXlUSzVZQnUzUGVLWWNqV2w1cGFjaWxEd1R2WE5PNVlXdFpnWG0ydHVMNjBDd01KQk4yamx4RTVIR2xMaEZVSUhLYnpYOEZQb0ZpZnc</guid></item><item><title>根据糖尿病专家的说法， 7个令人惊讶的习惯可以刺激你的血糖- EatingWell | 7 Surprising Habits That Can Spike Your Blood Sugar, According to Diabetes Experts - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFB6d3A5NXE0S3psVzl6djEyRUluVFB0SjhoVGZ0MzhJZ2NBb1E4UERLUV95TUs1dEF6V0V4dXlGcEZHbWNza2VLRFZncXZsdHVkbmsxUHp3NWFOSktSNklJQlZrcU5nVVhNVkFqWTlMYVFETVgwSjlfSVZxa3FWVDg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood sugar should rise and fall, but health issues can arise when glucose remains elevated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Certain medications and not addressing stress are some of the many reasons why blood sugar spikes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work with a certified diabetes educator or health care provider if you’re having trouble managing your glucose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some ups and downs in blood sugar are natural. What we want to avoid are large fluctuations in blood sugar, either too high or too low. Avoiding these fluctuations isn’t always easy—glucose variability can occur for a variety of reasons, like taking too much or too little medication, dehydration, stress, illness and overeating foods high in carbohydrates. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://rebeccajaspan.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Rebecca Jaspan, M.P.H., RD, CEDS, CDCES, &lt;/a&gt;describes the process, “Rises in blood sugar are normal for people with and without diabetes. Particularly when we eat, blood sugar rises, the hormone insulin is released and helps move the sugar from the blood into cells to produce energy.  When there is a disturbance in this insulin process, either from insulin resistance or not making enough insulin, the sugar stays in the blood and causes prolonged high blood sugar, which can be detrimental to health over time.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Here are seven habits diabetes experts recommend to help keep your blood sugar from spiking.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-not-addressing-your-stress"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Not Addressing Your Stress  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Stress is inevitable, but chronic stress that is not addressed can hurt your health. Jaspan says, “High stress is one factor that can increase blood sugar. When we are stressed, the stress hormones cortisol and adrenaline are released, which can raise blood sugar and disrupt normal insulin function. This ‘fight or flight’ response keeps sugar in the blood longer rather than it moving into cells.” &lt;a href="https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lauren Plunkett, RDN, CDCE&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian, certified diabetes care and education specialist and a person living with type 1 diabetes, adds, “When emotional stress is constant, it becomes chronic and this can lead to health problems over time.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-high-intensity-exercise"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. High-Intensity Exercise  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Exercise, a healthy habit, is important for increasing insulin sensitivity, i.e., how your body uses insulin. Regular exercise improves circulation, heart and respiratory health, and is a pivotal part in maintaining a healthy weight, increasing energy and mood, and building and maintaining bone and muscle.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Exercise improves blood sugar and can even cause it to dip below normal. However, for some people, strenuous exercise may cause blood sugar to rise. This occurs when adrenaline is released. Adrenaline can raise blood sugar by stimulating your liver to release glucose.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, Jaspan says, “The body needs more glucose for energy during this type of exercise, causing the liver to release glucose into the bloodstream.” This rise is usually short, and “not necessarily unhealthy,” and “a completely normal part of our physiology,” adds Plunkett. If you have insulin resistance and diabetes, Jaspan recommends incorporating a variety of exercises and focusing on low- and medium-intensity exercises such as walking, Pilates and moderate weight training.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-taking-certain-medications"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Taking Certain Medications  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Several classes of medications can cause blood sugar to rise. Medications like glucocorticoids, antipsychotics, heart medications (statins, beta blockers, diuretics), immunosuppressive drugs and hormone treatments are associated with changes in glucose metabolism and the incidence of high blood sugar or diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you have diabetes, make sure your care provider is aware of all the medications you’re taking. And don’t start or stop taking any medications without speaking to your provider first. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-not-paying-attention-to-hydration"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Not Paying Attention to Hydration  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you are not adequately hydrated, glucose becomes more concentrated in your blood, which can cause your levels to rise.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To stay hydrated, women should aim for 11.5 cups (91 ounces) of fluids per day and men 15.5 cups (125 ounces) of fluids per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This accounts for 20% of your fluid intake from the food you consume. However, your individual fluid needs can vary based on climate, sweat, physical activity and illness. Determine if you are adequately hydrated by examining your urine. It should be light yellow. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-eating-large-amounts-of-sugar-free-foods"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Eating Large Amounts of Sugar-Free Foods  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The American Diabetes Association cautions people with diabetes to carefully read labels, as sugar-free and no-sugar-added claims do not necessarily mean that a food is carbohydrate-free or lower in carbohydrates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Carbohydrates are the macronutrients that impact blood sugar the most. Therefore, if you overeat sugar-free foods, your blood sugar may rise too high. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keep in mind that “When we eat, our food has an absorption rate that lasts for several hours. Blood glucose rises and typically falls during this time, and the rate of absorption is a result of meal composition. If blood glucose rises while eating and continues to rise between meals, it might be time to talk with a dietitian trained in preventing insulin resistance through lifestyle,” says Plunkett. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-skipping-out-on-sleep"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Skipping Out on Sleep  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s tempting to stay up late to binge a thrilling new show or listen to your favorite podcast, but sleep and diabetes have a bidirectional relationship. Not enough sleep can cause blood sugar to rise. High blood sugar often interrupts sleep, especially if you are making frequent bathroom trips in the middle of the night. In a cohort study, researchers evaluated the risk of developing diabetes and sleep duration. They discovered that people who slept less than six hours per night had a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research also demonstrates that people with diabetes who have inadequate sleep duration or sleep quality have higher fasting blood sugar, hemoglobin A1C, and experience more insulin resistance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Ideally, aim for seven to nine hours of sleep per night. Try to be consistent and shoot for the same bedtime and wakeup time daily. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-getting-too-much-sun"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 7. Getting Too Much Sun  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Frequent sun exposure can increase the chances of getting burned. Sunburn is often accompanied by pain, which can increase stress hormones and, as a result, increase your blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blood glucose is supposed to rise and fall throughout the day. The problem occurs when blood sugar is elevated for long periods, increasing the risk of developing diabetes or complications of diabetes for those people who have it. Knowing where your blood sugar should be and which behaviors elevate it higher than normal is important. Many habits that increase blood sugar, such as too much stress, inadequate hydration and lack of sleep, can be remedied with simple lifestyle modifications. If you are unsure where to start or what your blood sugar should be, reach out to a certified diabetes educator or your health care provider.&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A protein long blamed for the brain damage seen in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="166298" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease has now been found in astonishingly high levels in healthy newborn babies, challenging decades of medical dogma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery could transform our understanding of both brain development and Alzheimer's disease itself. The protein, called p-tau217, has been viewed as a hallmark of neurodegeneration – yet a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article/7/3/fcaf221/8158110?login=false"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; reveals it's even more abundant in the brains of healthy infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than being toxic, p-tau217 may be essential for building the brain during early development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why this matters, it helps to know what tau normally does. In healthy brains, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28386764/#:%7E:text=Tau%20is%20well%20established%20as%20a%20microtubule%2Dassociated%20protein%20in%20neurons.&amp;amp;text=Recent%20advances%20in%20our%20understanding%20of%20the,synaptic%20plasticity%2C%20and%20regulation%20of%20genomic%20stability."&gt;tau&lt;/a&gt; is a protein that helps keep brain cells stable and allows them to communicate – essential functions for memory and overall brain function. Think of it like the beams inside a building, supporting brain cells so they can function properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-sad-case-of-the-youngest-person-ever-diagnosed-with-alzheimers?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;The Sad Case of The Youngest Person Ever Diagnosed With Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4072215/#:%7E:text=SUMMARY,success%20of%20developing%20novel%20therapies."&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, tau gets chemically changed into a different form called &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-024-03084-7"&gt;p-tau217&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of doing its normal job, this altered protein builds up and clumps together inside brain cells, forming tangles that impair cell function and lead to memory loss typical of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have assumed high levels of p-tau217 always spell trouble. The new research suggests they've been wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Dementia explained.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international team led by the University of Gothenburg analysed blood samples from over 400 people, including healthy newborns, young adults, elderly adults and those with Alzheimer's disease. What they found was striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Premature babies had the highest concentrations of p-tau217 of anyone tested. Full-term babies came second. The earlier the birth, the higher the protein levels – yet these infants were perfectly healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166305" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166305" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/premature_baby_642.jpg" alt="premature baby in a humidicrib" class="wp-image-166305 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/premature_baby_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/premature_baby_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/premature_baby_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166305" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Premature babies have the highest levels of p-tau217. (andresr/Getty Images Signature/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These levels dropped sharply during the first months of life, remained very low in healthy adults, then rose again in people with Alzheimer's – though never reaching the sky-high levels seen in newborns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern suggests p-tau217 plays a crucial role in early brain development, particularly in areas controlling movement and sensation that mature early in life. Rather than causing harm, the protein appears to support the building of new neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rethinking Alzheimer's disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications are profound. First, the findings clarify how to interpret &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-blood-test-used-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease"&gt;blood tests&lt;/a&gt; for p-tau217, recently approved by US regulators to aid dementia diagnosis. High levels don't always signal disease – in babies, they're part of normal, healthy brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More intriguingly, the research raises a fundamental question: why can newborn brains safely handle massive amounts of p-tau217 when the same protein wreaks havoc in older adults?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If scientists can unlock this protective mechanism, it could revolutionise Alzheimer's treatment. Understanding how infant brains manage high tau levels without forming deadly tangles might reveal entirely new therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also challenge a cornerstone of Alzheimer's research. For decades, scientists have believed p-tau217 only increases after another protein, amyloid, starts accumulating in the brain, with amyloid triggering a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3505"&gt;cascade&lt;/a&gt; that leads to tau tangles and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But newborns have no amyloid buildup, yet their p-tau217 levels dwarf those seen in Alzheimer's patients. This suggests the proteins operate independently and that other biological processes – not just amyloid – regulate tau throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research aligns with earlier animal studies. &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/9/4789"&gt;Research in mice&lt;/a&gt; showed tau levels peak in early development then fall sharply, mirroring the human pattern. Similarly, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6751069/"&gt;studies of foetal neurons&lt;/a&gt; found naturally high p-tau levels that decline with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If p-tau217 is vital for normal brain development, something must switch later in life to make it harmful. Understanding what flips this biological switch – from protective to destructive – could point to entirely new ways of preventing or treating Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, Alzheimer's research has focused almost exclusively on the damage caused by abnormal proteins. This study flips that perspective, showing one of these so-called "toxic" proteins may actually play a vital, healthy role at the start of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies' brains might hold the blueprint for keeping tau in check. Learning its secrets could help scientists develop better ways to preserve cognitive function as we age, transforming our approach to one of medicine's greatest challenges.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259838/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Her use of Mounjaro (or tirzepatide) was recorded as 'a contributing factor'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was the first death officially linked to the drug in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, Dr Alison Cave, chief safety officer for the Medicines &amp;amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) – the UK body that vets drug safety – expressed sympathy for Susan's family, but insisted: 'On the basis of the current evidence, the benefits [of these drugs] outweigh the potential risks when used for the licensed indications.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just days after &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-6b0fe5b0-55de-11f0-a72e-159540549ae5"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; England started offering Mounjaro to eligible obese people who need help to manage their weight, these weight-loss jabs are in the spotlight again following concerns about possible links to pancreatitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The MHRA has revealed it's received more than 560 reports of acute pancreatitis in patients taking GLP-1 injections since they were first approved in the UK; liraglutide (brand name Saxenda) was approved in 2017, semaglutide (Wegovy and Ozempic) in 2023, and tirzepatide last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ten cases have been fatal – five of them related to tirzepatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pancreas is a pear-shaped organ behind the stomach that produces digestive enzymes and insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Susan McGowan died after just two injections of Mounjaro she'd bought from an online pharmacist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acute pancreatitis is a painful condition which occurs over a short period of time when the pancreas becomes inflamed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most cases improve without treatment within about a week and have no further problems. But some people can go on to develop serious complications including necrosis, where the tissue of the pancreas starts to die. This can lead to infection, sepsis and organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The main symptom of pancreatitis is severe pain in the stomach that radiates to the back and does not go away; it can also cause fever and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just two weeks after she was prescribed Mounjaro, Sarah Miller, 54, an office administration assistant from Caerphilly, started to experience a 'niggling' pain on her left side just under her ribcage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the menopause her weight had ballooned to 18st (she's 5ft 9in), and she'd developed type 2 diabetes – she also has the autoimmune condition lupus, which can make exercise difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The nurse said Mounjaro would help me lose weight and might even put my diabetes into remission,' says Sarah. She was started on a low 2.5mg dose once a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At first all was well: I noticed decreased appetite and was excited as I started losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But two weeks in, I felt like I'd pulled a muscle. As the hours passed the pain got worse. I tried paracetamol; it didn't touch it. Then I tried ibuprofen, then the two together. Nothing helped.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The MHRA has revealed it's received more than 560 reports of acute pancreatitis in patients taking GLP-1 injections since they were first approved in the UK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then after about two weeks, one night she developed 'horrendous acid reflux'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I woke up coughing and spluttering and couldn't catch my breath,' she recalls. 'I called 111 and they gave me the details of the out-of-hours doctor, but by morning the acid had gone. However, the pain was now constant and really ruining my daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Coincidentally, that day I saw a news report about a woman who had &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-14058411/Nurses-death-UK-NHS-weight-loss-jab-Mounjaro.html"&gt;taken Mounjaro and developed pancreatitis and died&lt;/a&gt;. I Googled the symptoms then immediately stopped taking Mounjaro – and booked an urgent appointment with my GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Within days of stopping the medication, the pain went.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The MHRA is now keen to get a clearer idea of the scale of the problem by encouraging medics and patients who've been hospitalised to report this side-effect via its Yellow Card scheme – an online reporting system that allows patients and doctors to alert the MHRA to suspected adverse drug reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So should the estimated 1.5 million people in the UK who already use weight-loss jabs be worried?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the data we do have, acute pancreatitis is a rare side-effect – tirzepatide is known to cause it in just 0.39 per cent of users. Why it happens is still up for debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'One theory is GLP-1 agonists may contribute to acute pancreatitis by over-stimulating GLP-1 receptors in duct cells (in the pancreas) which secrete digestive enzymes into the small intestine,' says Alexander Miras, a clinical professor of medicine at the Ulster University and the Western Health &amp;amp; Social Care Trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If these over-produce enzymes it can cause widespread inflammation and tissue damage if they leak inside the pancreas.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'One theory is GLP-1 agonists may contribute to acute pancreatitis by over-stimulating GLP-1 receptors in duct cells,' says Alexander Miras&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He points to the fact that the GLP-1 class of drugs have been used for 18 years successfully to help people with diabetes without any major alerts over the risks of pancreatitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no physiological reason why the same class of drugs should start to cause more problems in people using them to lose weight than those using them to manage diabetes, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We know from multiple trials that less than three in 1,000 people on these drugs develop acute pancreatitis, and often this may be down to the fact that they have other health problems that make them more susceptible to this problem,' Professor Miras told Good Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We need to be cautious and keep an open mind – but until the MHRA investigations have concluded, we don't want to unnecessarily &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14308007/Deadly-effects-hidden-patients-drug-firms-Ozempic.html"&gt;alarm patients by telling them&lt;/a&gt; the medications are potentially lethal in very rare cases.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But as more people take the jabs – which work by mimicking a hormone, GLP-1, that's released in the gut when we eat and acts on receptors around the body, including the brain – concerns are growing that more people could end up suffering complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The problem is that we don't know enough to say for sure right now,' says Christian Macutkiewicz, a consultant surgeon specialising in problems with the liver, pancreas and gallbladder at Manchester Royal Infirmary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We have longer-term data about GLP-1 agonists when they are used to treat diabetes, but not when they are used for weight loss alone.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Is it a good idea to switch from Mounjaro to other weight-loss jabs? Professor Miras says that all GLP-1 medications have similar risk profiles but some are prescribed more often than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Mounjaro is one of the most widely prescribed drugs in this class, so this may be one of the reasons more people develop this uncommon side-effect.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another reason for not switching between GLP-1 medications is that this may actually cause more harm than good, according to 2024 research in the Cureus Journal of Medical Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Acute pancreatitis is a painful condition which occurs over a short period of time when the pancreas (in red) becomes inflamed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at the University of Florida found that switching actually made it more likely that someone would develop acute pancreatitis – 'especially if appropriate dose titration protocols are not followed'. In other words, the side-effects may be worsened if the dose is incorrectly calibrated and is too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One way to help reduce the risk of pancreatitis may be not to give these drugs to patients who are more prone to developing the condition – such as those who have already had pancreatitis and are at higher risk of it returning, or gallstones (a major cause of pancreatitis).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers are also examining whether those affected have a genetic trait that leaves them at greater risk of side-effects from GLP-1 agonist drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Matt Brown, chief scientific officer of Genomics England, is leading a team that will analyse genetic information from people who suffer acute pancreatitis linked to their fat jab use and submit a saliva sample to the Yellow Card Biobank – a database of DNA used to analyse why some people are more susceptible to drug reactions than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'We believe there is real potential to minimise these, with many adverse reactions having a genetic cause.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the meantime, Professor Miras points out that risks always need to be carefully weighed against benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Taking these jabs may be reasonable if you are living with obesity or diabetes and their complications, because they will improve your overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, people who are using these drugs for cosmetic reasons, just to be thinner, should be warned that there are risks that come with them and the consequences could be critical illness.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, which makes Ozempic and Wegovy, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14359315/Patients-took-Ozempic-2-0-clinical-trial-reveal-staggering-results-terrifying-effects.html"&gt;told Good Health: 'Patient safety is of the utmost importance.&lt;/a&gt; The known risks and benefits of GLP-1 medicines are described in the summary of product characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In the clinical trials conducted by Novo Nordisk, pancreatitis was reported as an adverse event in 0.1 per cent of Wegovy-treated patients and less than 0.1 per cent in patients given a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We recommend that patients take these medications only for their approved indications and under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional, who can advise on potential side-effects.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A spokesperson for Eli Lilly, the maker of Mounjaro, said: 'We take reports regarding patient safety seriously and actively monitor, evaluate and report safety information for all our medicines. Adverse events should be reported under the MHRA's Yellow Card scheme, but may be caused by other factors, including pre-existing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The Mounjaro (tirzepatide) patient information leaflet warns that inflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis) is an uncommon side-effect.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Sarah is now managing her diabetes with standard medication and a low-fat diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My weight now is about half a stone heavier – but my diabetes is under control,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think Mounjaro is a wonder drug when it works and I did lose 3 lb in those two weeks – but I think too many of us are taking it blindly, without cross-referencing other conditions we might have.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic health-ccox"&gt;Additional reporting by Julie Cook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 00:40:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNNk9INU54c0JCU3FsOW5tTXU3TmVDdFNVSHZrclJzd3N5eFNSUVl4SmVHZGE4NnozSjBSZnJnV0prbmdXWHFmajlKbUxmNlptQTZDT0p0d3l0SHBzNWlsRlJ5S2ZpZ1liTm1Cc3dWQWNKbHhMOUZuMU9MektPVm0wcWVHQjVqN0VHU0E4QzAzTnNUa1lNbE9FTWNJbWUwOWZDUDFz</guid></item><item><title>癌症患者正在敞开心扉，谈论他们希望不会被忽视的早期症状- BuzzFeed | Cancer Patients Are Opening Up About The One Early Symptom They Wish Wasn't Ignored - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE56dFVpUEZHMERBU2E0N214TGxOSXNjaFk2dG5TM3hQZVhQOUlPN3pHX0daV3lGU0dtaTVUVHdmdFF0emg1cl9BOGU1ZVI3N1lkQTEzRVZla3daQkFLblBfRXVzS3RqQkNYeGFUZTZZcXpGTEJiODZXX1BmNFpEdkU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

					&lt;p&gt;Over the years, many older adults experience a decline in muscle mass and strength. Factors like hormonal changes and a decline in hormones like testosterone play a role. Lifestyle factors also matter, including a sedentary lifestyle, inadequate nutrition, and chronic illnesses and inflammatory conditions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In mounting &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7700832/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, a sedentary lifestyle has been associated with an increased risk of metabolic diseases, cancer, &lt;a href="https://www.themanual.com/fitness/heart-disease-prevention-in-men/" rel&gt;and cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;. Getting our bodies moving comes with an array of protective health benefits, regardless of your age. Researchers are often studying the best types of exercise to improve bone density or preserve muscle mass, especially in later life. Let’s take a look at an interesting study on the best training type for preserving muscle mass in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" data-block-type="core"&gt;The research&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure data-wp-context='{"imageId":"686317770fb04"}' data-wp-interactive="core/image" class="wp-block-image size-large wp-lightbox-container" data-block-type="core"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://www.themanual.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/pexels-kampus-older-man-holding-a-kettlebell-e1751323163315.jpg?w=800&amp;amp;p=1" alt="older man holding a kettlebel" class="wp-image-1436931"&gt;&lt;button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-label="Enlarge" data-wp-init="callbacks.initTriggerButton" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-style--right="state.imageButtonRight" data-wp-style--top="state.imageButtonTop"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.physiology.org/detail/news/2024/11/21/kettlebell-training-may-help-maintain-muscle-strength-in-older-adults?SSO=Y" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; presented at the 2024 Integrative Physiology of Exercise Conference in Pennsylvania, researchers explored whether incorporating kettlebells into an exercise program &lt;a href="https://www.themanual.com/fitness/how-to-reduce-inflammation/" data-popup-added="true" rel&gt;would reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and enhance muscle strength in older adults, even those who hadn’t exercised recently. The study involved a mix of participants from different backgrounds with no prior experience &lt;a href="https://www.themanual.com/fitness/beginning-weightlifting/" data-popup-added="true" rel&gt;with resistance training&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adults between the ages of 60 and 80 began a “Strength After Sixty” exercise program at a nearby gym. For one year, participants finished two kettlebell training sessions every week at a rate of perceived exertion (RPE) of 7 out of 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list" data-block-type="core"&gt;
&lt;li data-block-type="core"&gt;After six months of kettlebell training, participants showed improvements in grip strength, upper leg strength, and increased muscle mass. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li data-block-type="core"&gt;After 12 months, physical function improved.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we can take away from this study is that it’s not too late to start a resistance training routine in your later years, and you’ll still get the benefits. This research demonstrated that kettlebell training for older adults can effectively strengthen muscles, increase muscle mass, reduce inflammation, and enhance grip strength, upper leg strength, and overall physical function. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to be a lifelong exercise or weight training enthusiast to pick up that kettlebell and get to work. For this study, the participants performed exercises like bent-over rows, squats, deadlifts, shoulder presses, and my personal favorite, &lt;a href="https://www.themanual.com/fitness/kettlebell-swings-guide/" rel&gt;the kettlebell swing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

						Some children across the Upstate are getting very sick and even dying from meningitis. A growing number of parents are concerned.   While health officials tell us it's impossible to know how many total meningitis cases we've had around South Carolina this year, doctors tell us the best way to protect against it is by getting vaccinated.  Meningitis is when bacteria, a virus, or in rare cases a fungus causes swelling around the membrane that protects the brain and spinal cord."You will develop neck stiffness," said Dr. Stephen Jones with Parkside Pediatrics. "Light sensitivity, crushing headache. And then it can progress very rapidly and lead to bad outcomes, including even death."It can affect anyone at any age — families, people living in dorms or barracks, or sports teams. Someone could carry the bacteria that cause meningitis and not know it. "A fair number of people carry this, this bacteria in their nasal passages. And they don't get sick from it," said Jones.It spreads through close contact with other people, from being in confined spaces, to kissing, to sharing drinks, lip gloss or vapes."You know, death is a possibility. But then there's also other significant concerns. You could lose a limb. You could have brain damage. You could have loss of hearing," Jones said.Jones said we've seen an increase of certain strains that can be tracked nationwide over the last year and a half. "I think we had a vaccine high during the pandemic, and since then we've seen a decline in vaccination rates," said Jones, saying all vaccination rates are down.So what's the best way to protect against this sometimes deadly condition?Teach your kids not to share drinks or food with other people. If your kid is sick, keep them home.  "So, I do recommend for people who have children to make sure that they discuss vaccines with their primary care physician," said Dr. Anna Burch with the South Carolina Department of Public Health.Across our region, parents are deciding what's best for their kids.   "I think for us it was the obvious choice," said Danielle Schoviak, who says she got her son vaccinated. "He plays travel soccer," she said. "So we travel with a lot of the kids. It's just important to, again, do what we can to protect our kids."While most strains can be vaccinated against, enterovirus meningitis, a form spread by a virus, has no vaccine.Oftentimes, Burch says, it surfaces as a bad summertime cold. But in some cases, especially for the immunocompromised, it can have life-altering impacts."We are seeing enterovirus everywhere," Burch said. "And I can just tell you that because working in the hospital, we have tons of cases right now. It is the season for enterovirus. Also, things that parents can do is making sure that their kids are washing their hands, that they're, again, not sharing utensils, not sharing drinks, not sharing foods with their friends, not sharing the lip gloss, those kind of things."

        &lt;p class="nih-pretitle"&gt;Monday, June 30, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;h1&gt;Breast cancer risk in younger women may be influenced by hormone therapy&lt;/h1&gt;
                  &lt;p class="nih-subtitle"&gt;NIH study could help to guide clinical recommendations for hormone therapy use among women under 55 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have found that two common types of hormone therapy may alter breast cancer risk in women before age 55. Researchers discovered that women treated with unopposed estrogen hormone therapy (E-HT) were less likely to develop the disease than those who did not use hormone therapy. They also found that women treated with estrogen plus progestin hormone therapy (EP-HT) were more likely to develop breast cancer than women who did not use hormone therapy. Together, these results could help to guide clinical recommendations for hormone therapy use among younger women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two hormone therapies analyzed in the study are often used to manage symptoms related to menopause or following hysterectomy (removal of uterus) or oophorectomy (removal of one or both ovaries). Unopposed estrogen therapy is recommended only for women who have had a hysterectomy because of its known association with uterine cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hormone therapy can greatly improve the quality of life for women experiencing severe menopausal symptoms or those who have had surgeries that affect their hormone levels,” said lead author Katie O’Brien, Ph.D., of NIH’s National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). “Our study provides greater understanding of the risks associated with different types of hormone therapy, which we hope will help patients and their doctors develop more informed treatment plans.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted a large-scale analysis that included data from more than 459,000 women under 55 years old across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Women who used E-HT had a 14% reduction in breast cancer incidence compared to those who never used hormone therapy. Notably, this protective effect was more pronounced in women who started E-HT at younger ages or who used it longer. In contrast, women using EP-HT experienced a 10% higher rate of breast cancer compared to non-users, with an 18% higher rate seen among women using EP-HT for more than two years relative to those who never used the therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, this suggests that for EP-HT users, the cumulative risk of breast cancer before age 55 could be about 4.5%, compared with a 4.1% risk for women who never used hormone therapy and a 3.6% risk for those who used E-HT. Further, the association between EP-HT and breast cancer was particularly elevated among women who had not undergone hysterectomy or oophorectomy. That highlights the importance of considering gynecological surgery status when evaluating the risks of starting hormone therapy, the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These findings underscore the need for personalized medical advice when considering hormone therapy,” said NIEHS scientist and senior author Dale Sandler, Ph.D. “Women and their health care providers should weigh the benefits of symptom relief against the potential risks associated with hormone therapy, especially EP-HT. For women with an intact uterus and ovaries, the increased risk of breast cancer with EP-HT should prompt careful deliberation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors noted that their study is consistent with previous large studies that documented similar associations between hormone therapy and breast cancer risk among older and postmenopausal women. This new study extends those findings to younger women, providing essential evidence to help guide decision-making for women as they go through menopause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While zucchini is considered safe for most people, there are a few precautions to keep in mind.

If you have a known allergy to cucurbit vegetables, you should avoid zucchini. Additionally, zucchini contains compounds called cucurbitacins, which can sometimes impart a bitter taste.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While rare, consuming overly bitter zucchini can lead to adverse side effects like stomachaches. To avoid this, ensure your zucchini tastes fresh before cooking or eating it.

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_5-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitter zucchini is often caused by high levels of cucurbitacins, naturally occurring bitter compounds found in plants such as cucumbers, pumpkins, melons and squash. To avoid bitterness, taste a small piece of zucchini raw before preparing your dish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of a cure for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="166250" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease is becoming an increasingly competitive and contentious quest with recent years witnessing several important controversies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/potential-fabrication-research-images-threatens-key-theory-alzheimers-disease"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; magazine&lt;/a&gt; reported that a key &lt;a href="https://doi.org/doi:10.1038/nature04533"&gt;2006 research paper, published in the prestigious journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which identified a subtype of brain protein called beta-amyloid as the cause of Alzheimer's, may have been based on fabricated data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One year earlier, in June 2021, the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/aducanumab-marketed-aduhelm-information"&gt;US Food and Drug Administration had approved aducanumab&lt;/a&gt;, an antibody-targeting beta-amyloid, as a treatment for Alzheimer's, even though the data supporting its use were incomplete and contradictory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some physicians believe aducanumab never should have been approved, while others maintain it should be given a chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-link-connects-herpes-to-alzheimers-heres-what-we-know?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;New Link Connects Herpes to Alzheimer's. Here's What We Know.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With millions of people needing an effective treatment, why are researchers still fumbling in this quest for a cure for what is arguably one of the most important diseases confronting humankind?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_142437" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-142437" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-642x500.jpg" alt="Clumps of yellow forming among purple neurons" class="size-medium wp-image-142437" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-642x500.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-768x598.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-600x467.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642.jpg 1204w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-142437" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustration of beta-amyloid plaques (yellow) amongst neurons.

The need for a new "out-of-the-clump" way of thinking about Alzheimer's is emerging as a top priority in brain science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My laboratory at the Krembil Brain Institute, part of the University Health Network in Toronto, is devising a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/trc2.12283"&gt;new theory of Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on our past 30 years of research, we no longer think of Alzheimer's as primarily a disease of the brain. Rather, we believe that Alzheimer's is principally &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1567205018666211202141650"&gt;a disorder of the immune system within the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immune system, found in every organ in the body, is a collection of cells and molecules that work in harmony to help repair injuries and protect from foreign invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a person trips and falls, the immune system helps to mend the damaged tissues. When someone experiences a viral or bacterial infection, the immune system helps in the fight against these microbial invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact same processes are present in the brain. When there is head trauma, the brain's immune system kicks into gear to help repair. When bacteria are present in the brain, the immune system is there to fight back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144645" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144645" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642.jpg" alt="Bright green cells with orange spots in between them" class="size-full wp-image-144645" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144645" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;White blood cells of the immune system activated to fight a bacterial infection. Green shows expression of molecules in their surfaces, and orange shows synthesis of molecules inside the cells. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAC8pLP43hw/"&gt;Dlumen/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alzheimer's as autoimmune disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that beta-amyloid is not an abnormally produced protein, but rather is a normally occurring molecule that is part of the brain's immune system. It is supposed to be there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When brain trauma occurs or when bacteria are present in the brain, beta-amyloid is a key contributor to the brain's comprehensive immune response. And this is where the problem begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of striking similarities between the fat molecules that make up both the membranes of bacteria and the membranes of brain cells, beta-amyloid cannot tell the difference between invading bacteria and host brain cells, and mistakenly attacks the very brain cells it is supposed to be protecting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This leads to a chronic, progressive loss of brain cell function, which ultimately culminates in dementia – all because our body's immune system cannot differentiate between bacteria and brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When regarded as a misdirected attack by the brain's immune system on the very organ it is supposed to be defending, Alzheimer's disease emerges as an autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many types of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, in which autoantibodies play a crucial role in the development of the disease, and for which steroid-based therapies can be effective. But these therapies will not work against Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain is a very special and distinctive organ, recognized as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234155/#"&gt;the most complex structure in the Universe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144646" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144646" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642.jpg" alt="A senior man and woman looking at a book together" class="size-full wp-image-144646" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144646" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Alzheimer's is arguably one of the most important diseases confronting humankind. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAD5TsR1koQ/"&gt;Robert Kneschke/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our model of Alzheimer's, beta-amyloid helps to protect and bolster our immune system, but unfortunately, it also plays a central role in the autoimmune process that, we believe, may lead to the development of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though drugs conventionally used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases may not work against Alzheimer's, we strongly believe that targeting other immune-regulating pathways in the brain will lead us to new and effective treatment approaches for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other theories of the disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to this autoimmune theory of Alzheimer's, many other new and varied theories are beginning to appear. For example, some scientists believe that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mito.2022.05.001"&gt;Alzheimer's is a disease of tiny cellular structures called mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; – the energy factories in every brain cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria convert oxygen from the air we breathe and glucose from the food we eat into the energy required for remembering and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some maintain that it is the end-result of a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/1673-5374.339476"&gt;particular brain infection&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/prd.12429"&gt;bacteria from the mouth often being suggested as the culprit&lt;/a&gt;. Still others suggest that the disease may arise from an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biom12050714"&gt;abnormal handling of metals within the brain&lt;/a&gt;, possibly zinc, copper, or iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is gratifying to see &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2021-327370"&gt;new thinking about this age-old disease&lt;/a&gt;. Dementia currently affects more than 50 million people worldwide, with a new diagnosis being made every three seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, people living with Alzheimer's disease are unable to recognize their own children or even their spouse of more than 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's is a public health crisis in need of innovative ideas and fresh directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144650" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144650" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642.jpg" alt="A young person kissing an older lady on the cheek" class="size-full wp-image-144650" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144650" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Often, people living with Alzheimer's disease are unable to recognize their own children.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Green tea may have more beneficial plant compounds for dementia than other teas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drinking 2.5 cups of green tea per day was associated with a 25% reduced risk of dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other foods with the same antioxidants as green tea include dark chocolate and berries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Brain health has become a popular topic as scientists continue to study the brain in more depth. And while there is still much to learn about the brain, one thing we do know is that dementia is on the rise. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dementia-risk-doubling-study-8776659" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;We recently reported&lt;/a&gt; on a study that suggests that new dementia cases may double from half a million to a million per year by the year 2060. Since we know more about the brain and how to take care of it than we did just a few years ago, this estimation is pretty astonishing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dementia is a general term for a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7903274/7-sneaky-signs-you-could-have-cognitive-decline-according-to-experts/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;loss of memory&lt;/a&gt;, language, problem-solving skills and other abilities that are severe enough to interfere with everyday life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7893378/these-13-things-could-make-you-more-likely-to-get-alzheimers-according-to-a-new-study/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; is the most common type of dementia. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We know that nutrition plays a large role in brain health. There’s even a diet designed specifically to provide brain-healthy nutrients, called the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290813/mind-diet-best-foods-to-eat-to-keep-your-brain-young/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists also consider specific foods to see if there is any correlation between them and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-habits-dementia-study-11695904" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;decreased disease risk&lt;/a&gt;. This is what researchers from Japan did regarding green tea and dementia risk. They recently published their findings in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers drew data from a long-running Japanese study called the Murakami study. This study included 13,660 people, about 52% women with an average age of 59. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some of the demographics adjusted for during statistical analysis included sex, age, BMI, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, education level, marital status and medical history. Participants also filled out food frequency questionnaires asking how much and how often certain foods and beverages were consumed, including tea and coffee.  Baseline data was collected between 2011 and 2013, and the average follow-up time for each participant was 11.5 years. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For tea and coffee, participants were given the following options for their intake: &amp;lt;1 cup per week, 1-2 cups per week, 3-4 cups per week, 5-6 cups per week, 1 cup per day, 2-3 cups per day, 4-6 cups per day, 7-9 cups per day, and 10 cups per day. Options were also given for canned and bottled tea and coffee, and amounts were calculated into the total intake. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to note that “a cup” can be interpreted as different amounts in studies and, in this case, is not equal to our American-sized measuring cup. For this reason, researchers calculated consumption into milliliters per day and then placed participants into one of four quartiles (categories). Q1 drank &amp;lt;94 mL of green tea per day, Q2 drank 94-299 mL/day, Q3 drank 300-599 mL/day and Q4 drank ≥ 600 mL/day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because they were looking specifically for associations between tea and dementia risk, researchers also gathered data regarding dementia from Japan’s long-term care insurance (LTCI) database. In the LTCI, physicians assess the degree of dementia and classify patients into six ranks ranging from no dementia (0) to severe dementia-related behavioral impairment and cognitive impairment requiring treatment (V)—basically using Roman numerals, plus the number 0. Those with rank II (moderate dementia-related behavioral disturbances and cognitive dysfunction with mild dependence) or higher are considered to have dementia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After running statistical analyses, researchers found that those in the higher quartiles for green tea intake had a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-to-lower-dementia-risk-41-11687021" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, those in the highest quartile, who drank at least 600 mL (or 20 fluid ounces) per day, had a 25% lower risk of dementia compared to those in the first quartile. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They also broke it down by cups of green tea consumed. Participants saw about a 5% reduction in dementia risk for each cup increase in green tea. For example, if someone averaged a cup of green tea a day, they may decrease their risk of dementia by 5%. For someone who drinks 2 cups a day, the reduction in risk goes to 10%. Keep in mind, though, that these cups are not what we consider a measuring cup amount—they’re actually closer to about ½ cup. As an example, Q4 drank at least 600 mL of green tea a day, which is equal to about 2.5 American measuring cups, and reduced their risk of dementia by 25% compared to those in Q1.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because there is some evidence that coffee may decrease dementia risk, researchers were curious to know if those who drank both coffee and green tea might lower their risk even more. Turns out, unlike those who drank a lot of green tea, adding high levels of coffee in addition to green tea did not have the same effects as green tea alone, and showed no reduction in dementia risk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers propose a couple of possible reasons for this. First, drinking both green tea and coffee in high doses might have a sort of overdose effect, especially regarding caffeine. As an example, green tea contains 20 mg of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/caffeinated-drinks-ranked-by-caffeine-levels-8607309" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;caffeine per 100 mL&lt;/a&gt; dose, and coffee contains 60 mg of caffeine for the same amount. During the combined portion of this trial, participants in Q4 consumed at least 600 mL/day of green tea and 300 mL/day of coffee, which averages out to 300 mg of caffeine per day. And some were drinking well beyond these amounts. The current recommendation for caffeine is no more than 400 mg/day, so those in Q4 were definitely near or beyond that amount.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers also note that coffee and tea contain different plant compounds and that they may counteract each other. But they seemed to lean more into the caffeine theory.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are a few limitations to this study. One is that participants’ cognitive status was not assessed at baseline. So there’s a chance that those who had lower cognitive function at the start of the study drank less green tea. If this is true, then the association between green tea and reduced risk of dementia would be weaker. Also, because green tea consumption was estimated based on self-reports, it leaves room for bias and inaccuracies. Lastly, the type of dementia wasn’t investigated, so they can’t say which types of dementia green tea may reduce. Researchers do note, however, that because it’s estimated that Alzheimer’s disease makes up about two-thirds of dementia cases, green tea may help reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; All types of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8044312/is-tea-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;true teas&lt;/a&gt;—green, black, white and oolong—are loaded with antioxidants. They are, after all, plants, and all plants contain antioxidants. But compared to the others, green tea has been shown to have the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-as-many-antioxidants-as-green-tea-11761365" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;highest levels of catechins&lt;/a&gt;, a specific type of flavonoid antioxidant, providing about four times more catechins than black tea.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One of these catechins is epigallocatechin3-gallate (EGCG), which researchers note in previous studies has been linked to reduced Alzheimer’s risk. Reasons for this may be due to EGCG’s ability to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-top-nutrients-to-fight-inflammation-8675325" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, including in the brain, plus reduce amyloid-beta and tau-tangle accumulation, both of which are implicated in Alzheimer’s disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s not to say that other teas don’t have their own benefits. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-tea-to-drink-to-live-longer-8787658" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;black tea&lt;/a&gt; may help you live longer, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ginger-tea-benefits-8603959" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;ginger tea&lt;/a&gt; can help ease an upset stomach and reduce arthritis pain. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mint-tea-health-benefits-8421322" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Mint tea&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to have digestive, respiratory and mental health benefits, as well as antimicrobial and antiviral properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides brain health, green tea has also &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-green-tea-good-for-you-8363574" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;been associated with lower inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, better digestion, less bloating, improved blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/flavanoid-variety-cancer-study-11749936" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduced risk of cancer&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s easy to add green tea to your life. Simply &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-long-should-you-steep-tea-11713114" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;brew up a cup&lt;/a&gt;. Ideally, we recommend using loose-leaf tea and steeping it in a tea strainer. The reason for this is that some tea bags have been shown to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-limit-microplastics-in-your-food-11713723" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;contain microplastics&lt;/a&gt;. These tiny particles may end up steeping from the bag into your cup of tea and ultimately into your body, including your brain. If you’re looking to limit your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/microplastics-kitchen-tools-swaps-11722606" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;microplastic exposure&lt;/a&gt;, a tea strainer may be the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/microplastics-tea-bags-infusers-amazon-11700117" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;best steeping option&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plain green tea is best, but adding a small amount of honey or sugar or a touch of milk is fine if that’s how you prefer it. Just be mindful of how much you add, since too much &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7911108/best-and-worst-foods-for-brain-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;added sugar has been associated with worse brain health&lt;/a&gt;, including dementia. If you want to get to zero additions in your tea, take your usual amount of sweetener and/or cream and begin reducing that amount each week until you’re at nothing but the tea. Doing this gradually will help your taste buds adjust. It’s also important to point out that the longer you steep your tea, the more bitter it’s likely to become. If you don’t care for the bitterness, go with shorter steeping times.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-tea-for-metabolic-syndrome-8782901" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;higher consumption of green tea&lt;/a&gt; is associated with reduced risk of dementia, compared to those with little to no green tea intake.
