That applies to those over 65, a CVS spokeswoman wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.newsday.com/news/health/covid-vaccination-questions-mkkumlfq" target="_blank"&gt;authorized three updated COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for people 65 and over as well as those with underlying health conditions such as high blood pressure, asthma and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other people can get the vaccine after consulting with their doctors, according to a &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy?lang=en" target="_blank"&gt;social media post&lt;/a&gt; from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear what that would entail for healthy adults under the age of 65 and children as respiratory virus season looms. September and October are the prime time for people to receive COVID-19 and influenza vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled to meet Sept. 18-19. That panel usually makes recommendations on vaccines for the general public and can be pivotal in whether health insurance companies pay for the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;a href="https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/cdc-monarez-fired-trump-kennedy-vaccines-science-l07051" target="_blank"&gt;current upheaval at the CDC&lt;/a&gt; following the firing of its latest director could also have an impact. Health professionals expressed concerns in June when Kennedy, a longtime vaccine critic, fired all members of the ACIP and replaced them with appointees who have also publicly expressed skeptical views of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eve Meltzer Krief, a pediatrician at Allied Physician Group’s Huntington Village Pediatrics, said she has not received any information about changes to the way vaccines are delivered to children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think we are waiting to see if insurance companies will cover the vaccine according to the American Academy of Pediatrics guidance recommending children 6 months to 2 years get the vaccine," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meltzer Krief said documenting high-risk conditions such as asthma will be "cumbersome and not efficient particularly at this late date."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nidhin Mohan, owner and supervising pharmacist at New Island Pharmacy in Deer Park, said he has not yet heard anything about the need for prescriptions or other limitations but doesn’t expect any issues with supply since he can order directly from Pfizer and other pharmaceutical firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walgreens, the nation's second largest pharmacy chain, did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lisa L.

GTP provides essential energy for cleaning up dead cells, with a lack of the compound previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-022-00717-x"&gt;being linked&lt;/a&gt; to the development of Alzheimer's in aging brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171918" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171918" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GTPPower.jpg" alt="GTP graphical abstract" class="wp-image-171918 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GTPPower.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GTPPower-600x297.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171918" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;GTP is closely related to autophagy, the natural recycling of dead cells. (Santana et al., &lt;em&gt;GeroScience&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;GTP-boosted neurons were shown to help the brain clear out damaging clumps of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta"&gt;amyloid beta proteins&lt;/a&gt;, which have long been linked with the progression of Alzheimer's. The compounds also reversed damage associated with age in brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While GTP has previously been linked with neurodegeneration, the study reveals how levels can drop over time, especially when Alzheimer's is involved. The researchers speculate that the combination of epigallocatechin gallate and nicotinamide may return GTP to levels found in younger cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study highlights GTP as a previously underappreciated energy source driving vital brain functions," &lt;a href="https://news.uci.edu/2025/08/06/uc-irvine-researchers-find-combination-of-natural-compounds-for-brain-cleaning/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Brewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-more-green-tea-each-day-cuts-risk-of-dementia-brain-lesions"&gt;a separate study&lt;/a&gt; linked green tea with fewer white matter lesions in the brain, and in turn a lower dementia risk, though the research didn't prove direct cause and effect. Nicotinamide &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1178646918776658"&gt;has also been implicated&lt;/a&gt; in protecting neurons from the effects of stroke and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this research, we know that GTP might be part of the reason why – and that epigallocatechin gallate and nicotinamide could make a critical difference together. It's going to take some time to turn this into a treatment, and it's important to note that this has only been tested in mouse cells &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"&gt;in vitro&lt;/a&gt;, but the results are encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As people age, their brains show a decline in neuronal energy levels, which limits the ability to remove unwanted proteins and damaged components," &lt;a href="https://news.uci.edu/2025/08/06/uc-irvine-researchers-find-combination-of-natural-compounds-for-brain-cleaning/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Brewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that restoring energy levels helps neurons regain this critical cleanup function."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-025-01786-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeroScience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON — Two siblings at Klein Cain High School have been diagnosed with active tuberculosis, prompting Harris County Public Health officials to conduct contact tracing. Klein ISD is also notifying potentially affected families and staff members.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the district was alerted about the cases by Harris County Public Health, they sent targeted notifications to a small group of students and staff who may have had prolonged close contact with an infected student. Klein ISD also sent general notifications to all Klein Cain families and staff.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The affected students are currently receiving medical care and are not on campus. They will not be permitted to return until cleared by a physician or Harris County Public Health in accordance with state health regulations.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health experts say tuberculosis is not transmitted through casual contact, such as walking past someone in a hallway. The disease typically requires prolonged, close contact in an enclosed setting to be transmitted. Harris County Public Health officials are conducting official contact tracing to identify anyone who may have had such exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"TB is treatable and curable with medication," the district emphasized in letters sent to families.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klein Cain High School contacted specific students and staff members who shared classes with one of the infected students during the potentially contagious period. Families who were not contacted directly by the school have not been referred to Harris County Public Health as potential close contacts, though they may still be contacted if identified during the ongoing contact tracing process.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district noted that, due to privacy laws, it cannot disclose any information that could potentially identify the students. School officials requested that the community respect the privacy of the students and their family.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents with questions about potential exposure can contact their child's healthcare provider, visit the Harris County Public Health Tuberculosis Information site, or contact the county's TB Program at (832) 927-7575 during business hours or via email at &lt;a href="mailto:Epidemiology_Program@phs.hctx.net"&gt;Epidemiology_Program@phs.hctx.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Families with questions about why they received notification letters can contact Klein Cain High School at (832) 375-8503.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

The team chopped on polyethylene and polypropylene boards, mixed the released particles into feed, and watched how the gut responded over weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tiny particles, called microplastics, are fragments of plastic smaller than 0.2 inches that can carry additives and hitchhiking chemicals. The results did not look the same for each plastic, which matters for everyday kitchens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-the-cutting-board-study"&gt;Inside the cutting board study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team, led by Hai-Jun Gan from the School of Environment at &lt;a href="https://hjxy.nju.edu.cn/English/HOME/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nanjing University&lt;/a&gt;, used two common plastics, polypropylene and polyethylene – then prepared mouse diets on these boards for four and 12 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polypropylene particles averaged about 10 micrometers, while polyethylene pieces averaged about 27 micrometers, which means the polypropylene feed contained many more particles for the same mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By week 12, the diets prepared on plastic carried roughly a milligram of microplastics per gram of feed, and the number rose with repeated chopping cycles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent laboratory work reported that a single cut on a new polypropylene board can release on the order of 100 to 300 particles, which helps explain why older boards tend to shed more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-different-plastics-different-effects"&gt;Different plastics, different effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polypropylene did not just ride through the gut. Mice eating polypropylene board &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dishwashers-release-nearly-a-million-plastic-particles-per-cycle/"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt; showed higher blood markers that track inflammation and gut barrier stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The markers included lipopolysaccharide and &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/c-reactive-protein-test/about/pac-20385228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;C-reactive protein&lt;/a&gt;, and lower expression of tight junction genes that help seal the intestinal wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polyethylene told a different story. The mice did not show clear signs of inflammation, but their gut microbiota shifted after 12 weeks, with a lower share of &lt;em&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/em&gt; and a higher share of &lt;em&gt;Desulfobacterota&lt;/em&gt; in the cecum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shift lined up with distinct changes in fecal and liver metabolites, especially bile-acid related compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contrast matters. It points to particle size, count, surface chemistry, and additives as separate levers of harm, instead of a single “plastic effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-polypropylene-boards-and-microplastics"&gt;Polypropylene boards and microplastics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic cutting boards are not the only source of microplastics in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/food-packaging-is-leaking-harmful-chemicals-into-meals/"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, but they are close to the action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis estimating real-world chopping suggested that people could ingest 7.4 to 50.7 grams per year from polyethylene boards and about 49.5 grams from polypropylene boards, depending on use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those numbers track with the lab result that repeated chopping increases particle release as surfaces become scarred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are not limited to kitchens. They have been &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/glass-bottles-contain-more-microplastics-than-plastic-containers/"&gt;measured in human blood&lt;/a&gt;, which tells us that particles are bioavailable and can circulate to different tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical researchers have also detected plastics in carotid artery plaques and linked their presence to higher rates of heart attack, stroke, or death over nearly three years in a 304 patient cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those findings do not prove that plastic cutting boards cause disease. They show that human exposure is real, widespread, and worth reducing where it is sensible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gut-response-to-different-plastics"&gt;Gut response to different plastics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut barrier is more than a wall. It is a dynamic system that includes mucus, tight junctions, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/daylight-boosts-the-immune-systems-ability-to-fight-infections/"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt; signals, and bacterial metabolites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polypropylene particles in this experiment lined up with lower expression of genes that help seal that barrier and higher activity of myosin light chain kinase, a protein that can loosen junctions and permit lipopolysaccharide to enter the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polyethylene pushed on metabolism and community structure instead. Bile acids, the detergents our livers make to manage fat and signal to the gut, dropped in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, specific microbially shaped bile acids in the gut also shifted. That pattern fits a gut liver axis response, not a classic inflammatory spike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One plastic leaned toward barrier injury. The other leaned toward ecosystem drift. Neither path is good news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wood-is-not-a-perfect-solution"&gt;Wood is not a perfect solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People switch to wood to avoid plastic shedding. That can reduce &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-are-escaping-from-water-treatment-plants/"&gt;microplastic&lt;/a&gt; ingestion, but any swap needs basic hygiene. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knife scars, moisture, and fat can trap microbes on any surface, and regulators have wrestled with these tradeoffs for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food safety guidance has long noted that wooden boards behave differently from scarred plastics and can be harder or easier to sanitize depending on use and cleaning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is routine cleaning, separation of raw and ready-to-eat foods, and timely replacement of boards that are deeply grooved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-weigh-plastic-risks"&gt;How to weigh plastic risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on the limited evidence available, chemicals and biofilms associated with microplastics in drinking-water pose a low concern for human health,” according to the World Health Organization (&lt;a href="https://www.who.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that is drinking water, not food, and it reflects what we know today, not a permanent verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where kitchen practice and common sense meet science. Replace old plastic boards more often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid harsh scraping that chews up surfaces. Keep raw meat, seafood, and produce on separate boards, and clean thoroughly with hot water and detergent after each use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a bigger picture. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-from-plastic-bottles-linked-to-high-blood-pressure-and-heart-problems/"&gt;Plastics&lt;/a&gt; differ by polymer and additives, and they age in different ways. Real exposure rarely involves clean, single-polymer spheres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results in people may hinge on mixtures, particle sizes, and how the gut is already primed by diet, stress, medications, and infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-directions-in-cutting-board-studies"&gt;Future directions in cutting board studies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mouse study used realistic chopping, not pristine pellets, which is why it stands out. Next steps include human exposure tracking that can pair biomarkers with what people actually do in their &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plastic-kitchen-utensils-may-leach-toxic-chemicals-in-food/"&gt;kitchens&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also plan to compare particle counts and sizes from new, moderately used, and heavily scarred boards across brands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are also working to standardize sampling and detection from tap water to tissue so estimates line up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That will help translate animal data into sharper human guidance, without overstating confidence or downplaying potential trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/EHP15472" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Environmental Health Perspectives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 19:21:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxQd0JTb2hJS2R5STFwdHREcjBhTjE5dWU2QXdrV3QydzBfbDBrX3YwNmFDVXh0U2Z5RnRLbUpTNDl5TERzRkplSnp2RU9HazR6ZzRIRG1iRWl5SHpXS05KbVBaQWpveDYtRWJCYmpBZE1TTzV3eEM5aUtfVmkwOEthOW81c3ZBTWZGQ2htSUgxWHUzYXE5OUMtVXNxUnlyN0I4WGVGWm45bVZOUlFXblVieXhCQS03UjhOMnBET19UQQ</guid></item><item><title>在RFK Jr.变更后，您可以在CVS获得新冠疫苗的州- Axios</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2025/08/29/cvs-covid-vaccines-kennedy-rfk</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 19:20:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBCclNWbmJuM1VFb0ZqTUZMXzFzdUt5YkxsOG5UZ1V1YVEwWUxJVVVvUno0cUdQdlljcHBVZU1YdGZ1b3JsSFNJcVRWMHJvc3N1b1RVeG9DdTM2d1V4WEhmbk9tYVRjanhUaWJUd3BBSkQ</guid></item><item><title>纽约军团爆发可追溯到城市拥有的网站，包括哈莱姆医院-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/29/nyregion/nyc-legionnaires-disease-harlem-hospital.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 19:06:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQY2lBVzgyaUFISHB6dEdURDdQSHZoMWtUaWhpZERKVjd0UGVjWGM5NVVIMlFoMmI1bFFoSkhjdEVXVlE4Ymc3UHdWdk1rLW5yMVdGT3pmckJwWjJSNEFBaWppbzZWQ1JRT1otMjFWU2V2WC1CQ2ZadGlXeVMwMGc5aE0tcTF0dXl0OWV5SnNtTmZoanc</guid></item><item><title>无需医院的急诊护理：私人诊所连锁店在西部地铁扩张- Star Tribune</title><link>https://www.startribune.com/emergency-care-without-the-hospital-private-clinic-chain-expands-in-west-metro/601458140</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;A group of emergency physicians is bringing its urgent care-plus model of medicine to the west metro area, following years of success in the east metro plus a couple nervy years during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;The Urgency Room’s fourth Twin Cities location, in Golden Valley, started slowly by treating less than 100 patients in its first week. A blank whiteboard indicated zero patients during a visit Monday afternoon. But clinic leaders believe it’s a matter of time before it thrives like the locations in Eagan, Vadnais Heights and Woodbury that are staffed with ER doctors and have advanced imaging and lab capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;The approach might be overkill for most patients with typical urgent care needs, such as tests for strep throat or persistent cough, but it saves time and money when treating patients with complex conditions who otherwise visit crowded hospitals, said Dr. Craig Matticks, the Urgency Room’s medical director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;“What we’re really good at in emergency medicine is figuring out what people have and figuring out what people need,” he said. “We’re bringing that into the outpatient setting for all those patients that don’t actually need immediate, critical interventions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;The Urgency Room, a doctor-owned private practice, has grown despite competing in an urgent care marketplace dominated by large multispecialty health systems like Allina Health, HealthPartners and M Health Fairview. Each of the east metro Urgency Room locations treats more than 30,000 patients per year, Matticks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Emergency Physicians P.A. (EPPA) owns and staffs all four locations. The medical group started in the east metro to avoid competition with the hospital ERs at which its doctors work on contract, including Methodist Hospital in St. Louis Park, Southdale Hospital in Edina and North Memorial in Robbinsdale. But Matticks said they had been planning for years to add a west metro location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Physician-owned treatment centers have &lt;a href="https://www.aha.org/fact-sheets/2023-03-28-select-financial-operating-and-patient-characteristics-pohs-compared-non-pohs-fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.aha.org/fact-sheets/2023-03-28-select-financial-operating-and-patient-characteristics-pohs-compared-non-pohs-fact-sheet"&gt;faced criticism from community hospitals&lt;/a&gt; because they often set up in wealthier suburbs and limit their exposure to low-income and uninsured patients. The Urgency Room takes low-income patients covered by Minnesota’s Medical Assistance program and uninsured patients, though they must submit a $350 deposit before receiving care, according to &lt;a href="https://www.urgencyroom.com/who-we-are/frequently-asked-questions/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.urgencyroom.com/who-we-are/frequently-asked-questions/"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box   article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;EPPA’s urgent care model is unusual, but it’s responding to the same consumer demands that have resulted in more urgent care clinics nationally and also standalone emergency rooms, said Allan Baumgarten, a &lt;a href="https://allanbaumgarten.com/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://allanbaumgarten.com/"&gt;Twin Cities analyst&lt;/a&gt; of health care markets.

							&lt;p&gt;We all know them. The people who make you do a double-take when they mention their age. Not because they've had work done, but because they seem to have negotiated a better deal with time. They move like they're younger, their skin glows without Instagram filters, and they have that energy that makes you wonder what they're putting in their coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing: they're not doing anything you couldn't do. No exotic supplements, no $500 face creams, no bizarre biohacking. They've just been quietly consistent with habits most of us know about but somehow never stick to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference isn't what they know—it's what they actually do, every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They protect their sleep like it's sacred&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just getting eight hours—actually protecting the quality of those hours. They have bedtimes that would make teenagers roll their eyes. They've been turning off screens an hour before bed since before it was trendy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/good-nights-sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; affects cellular regeneration more than any serum ever could. While you're scrolling at midnight, they're giving their bodies time to actually repair the damage of existing. Their growth hormone is doing its job while yours is struggling against blue light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They treat sleep like a non-negotiable appointment with aging prevention. Boring? Maybe. Effective? Look at their skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They move constantly, not intensely&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're not CrossFit warriors or marathon runners. They just never really stop moving. They take stairs without thinking about it. They garden, walk to get coffee, stretch while watching TV. Movement is woven into their day, not scheduled into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This constant, gentle activity keeps their &lt;a href="https://www.visiting-angels.co.uk/middlesex/blog/daily-activities-and-exercise-for-the-elderly/#:~:text=It%20(%20Exercise%20)%20also%20supports%20better,the%20benefits%20to%20cardiovascular%20health%20are%20significant." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;metabolism active&lt;/a&gt; and joints lubricated. They avoid the inflammation that comes from both extreme exercise and complete sedentary living. Their bodies stay functional because they keep using all the functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not about workout intensity; it's about never letting their body forget how to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They eat real food without making it weird&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No dramatic diets, no superfood obsessions, no elimination protocols that make dinner parties awkward. They just eat actual food—vegetables, fruits, proteins—most of the time. They've been doing this since before kale had a publicist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their approach to eating patterns is remarkably undramatic. They eat sugar occasionally without guilt. They have wine with dinner sometimes. But their baseline is real, recognizable food that doesn't need a nutrition label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They figured out that consistency beats perfection. Their cells are well-fed, not confused by constant dietary whiplash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They hydrate like it's their job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water bottle always within reach, but you never see them forcing down gallons. They sip constantly, automatically, like breathing. Their skin cells are perpetually plump, their joints cushioned, their organs functioning smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proper hydration affects everything from skin elasticity to cognitive function. But they're not water-logging themselves. They maintain steady hydration rather than cycling between desert and flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their lips aren't chapped, their skin doesn't flake, and they never get those dehydration headaches. Water is their most basic beauty secret, and they've been consistent about it for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They manage stress instead of denying it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don't pretend stress doesn't exist—they've just developed actual strategies for dealing with it. Maybe it's meditation, maybe it's walking, maybe it's calling a friend. But they have a plan that isn't "push through and collapse later."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress is aging's best friend, breaking down collagen and accelerating cellular damage. These people learned early that stress management isn't self-indulgence—it's self-preservation. They process emotions instead of storing them in their jaw, shoulders, and eventually, their face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They look younger because they're not carrying twenty years of unprocessed tension in their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They maintain social connections actively&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not social media connections—actual humans they see and talk to regularly. They have standing coffee dates, regular calls with old friends, conversations with neighbors. They invest in relationships like they're compound interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Social connections&lt;/a&gt; age people better than any intervention. These folks understood this before the research proved it. They maintain their social network like it's critical infrastructure—because it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their faces are animated from actual conversations, not just selfie practice. They laugh real laughs regularly. Connection keeps them vital in ways no supplement can replicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They protect their skin from the sun religiously&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not hiding indoors—just being smart about exposure. They've been wearing sunscreen daily since the 1990s. Hats aren't fashion statements; they're face-savers. They find shade automatically, like plants finding light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3790843/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sun damage&lt;/a&gt; accounts for up to 80% of visible facial aging signs. While everyone else was pursuing the perfect tan, they were playing the long game. Their skin cells haven't been repeatedly traumatized by radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They still enjoy the outdoors—they just do it without volunteering their face as a solar panel. Their wrinkles are from smiling, not from decades of squinting against sun damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what's maddening and liberating: none of this is revolutionary. These aren't secrets—they're basics that compound over time. The 60-year-olds who look 45 didn't discover anything we don't know. They just did the boring, sensible things consistently while everyone else was looking for shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They started these habits in their thirties and forties, when the damage was still reversible and the habits still had time to compound. They chose daily disciplines over future procedures. They prevented instead of corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, aging well isn't about finding the fountain of youth—it's about not poisoning the well you already have. It's about treating your body like you plan to keep living in it, because you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people look younger because they've been living like they respect their future selves for decades. They didn't wait for a health scare or a bad photo to start taking care of themselves. They just quietly, consistently chose the habits that honor the body they're in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that, more than any cream or procedure, is why they look the way they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="vegou-quiz-after-article" id="vegou-2759822759"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s Your Plant-Powered Archetype?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder what your everyday habits say about your deeper purpose—and how they ripple out to impact the planet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 90-second quiz reveals the plant-powered role you’re here to play, and the tiny shift that makes it even more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 fun questions. Instant results. Surprisingly accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They may also eat non-food objects or steal from other people's plates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marilena Aiello, a neuroscientists who researches the condition, said previously: 'These behaviors are problematic, of course, socially, but also with regard to patients' health as they tend to gain weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[But], some people lose weight because they eat a narrow range of foods in an obsessive way.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was not clear why the condition may cause this behavior, but researchers say it is potentially linked to alterations in the body's signals for hunger and fullness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bruce Willis, pictured above with wife Emma Heming in July 2018, is a sufferer of frontotemporal dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was not known whether Bruce Willis suffers from any compulsive eating behaviors as a result of his condition, but his family has said he is struggling with communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15036003/bruce-willis-wife-subtle-symptom-frontotemporal-dementia-diagnosis.html"&gt;And earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, his wife Heming Willis revealed the subtle sign he started to suffer shortly before his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/video/bruce-willis-wife-emma-heming-willis-speaks-124980747"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;: 'For someone who is really talkative, very engaged, he was just a little more quiet, and when the family would get together he would kind of just melt a little bit.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also soon began losing words, she said, and a stutter he dealt with as a child returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[He] felt very removed, a little cold, not like Bruce, who is very warm and affectionate to going the complete opposite of that was alarming and scary,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In frontotemporal dementia, behavioral changes are normally the first noticeable sign of the disease. In Alzheimer's, for comparison, which affects up to 6.7million people,  the first signs are normally memory loss or confusion with time or place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, more areas of the brain degenerate, meaning patients with frontotemporal dementia eventually often mirror those with late-stage Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts say that people suffering from the condition may have compulsive eating behaviors (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other symptoms of frontotemporal dementia include difficulty eating or swallowing, trouble walking and being vulnerable to infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is not normally fatal on its own, but weakens the body and raises the risk of life-threatening infections or other complications. This may include problems swallowing or eating and drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure for the disease, although some drugs and therapies may help to slow the progression of the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also not clear what causes the dementia, although it has previously been linked to a build-up of protein clumps in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some researchers say it can also be caused by damage to blood vessels in the brain, that they say can affect the supply of nutrients and oxygen to brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 17:10:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxQY1d6ZlVrX2pQeHNMUkFuU3hseEdHTVpoVHBCWHVxMDdvSzBzZWxDalBVZ1dQNUt2TzRnUHB5NVhFSGhRQm1hVzdVTkZGSi1qNjgwS1JIZXQ3OU5Ma3pqVlNRbDNaVXFMenRpOVh5QmYxbDF2UXA1ZVZpUjRfZDdHUUVITUZSS2lfdkRHbzFGRURNSzEyM1RKNUJhMTRZMlnSAaQBQVVfeXFMUC1qMDBDT3RtdUVHdm8zLTdJdTRKUE1xZHRVWGVqOHNUSzlfWFBmWmVqRUJRVjNQLUlCZVVxZldpUWxLbnUzaU9lYVdlcDNyd1V1bU9WZW45TXlnc29fNDFoTFBlUW8wYk95SGZVbEUtaXdBc2pFWU5WaDd3cVBCdU5iREFsNEh0ZVlHSUd1eFR0REMwYjVEbllNVjdBdGMwWWJNd20</guid></item><item><title>纽约市宣布第7例死亡宣布后，哈莱姆军团疫情爆发结束- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/7th-person-dies-legionnaires-outbreak-harlem-114-confirmed-cases-rcna227951</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4d019d" class="body-graf"&gt;New York City health officials on Friday declared the Harlem Legionnaires’ disease outbreak over, a day after revealing a seventh associated death as the patient count ticked up slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-007cf0" class="body-graf"&gt;There have been no new cases among people who live and work in the affected area since Aug. 9, health officials said, meaning the cluster can be considered ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6066db" class="body-graf"&gt;Legionnaires’ disease is a type of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria, which grow in warm water and spread through building water systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-407ac5" class="body-graf"&gt;In total, health officials said 90 people were hospitalized throughout the duration of the outbreak, which went back to late July.

&lt;p&gt;COLDWATER, MI (WTVB) – An individual at Coldwater High School was recently diagnosed with active tuberculosis (TB). The Branch- Hillsdale-St Joseph Community Health Agency (BHSJCHA) was recently notified and an investigation has been initiated. BHSJCHA has notified Coldwater High School (CHS), and has confirmed the individual is currently undergoing treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHS is working with the health agency  to identify potential students and staff from the Spring Semester of the 2024- 25 school year to determine who should be evaluated for TB infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the coming week, anyone identified as being potentially exposed to TB will receive a notification with recommendations for testing and a health&lt;br&gt;
questionnaire. BHSJCHA, in partnership with CHS, will communicate how the health questionnaire and testing can be completed. Evaluation and testing through BHSJCHA will be at no cost to family or staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or your child are not identified as exposed to TB, no action is required on your part, and testing is not recommended. However, if you choose to seek testing for your peace of mind, you may contact your doctor or the BHSJCHA clinic at 517-279-9561 extension 123.&lt;br&gt;
You should Monitor for TB signs and symptoms in yourself or your child. Although it is cold and flu season, TB symptoms can be different. Active TB disease can cause a cough with or without blood, sweating at night, weight loss or inability to gain weight, low appetite, feeling tired, swollen glands, or chest pain,&lt;br&gt;
among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms can start gradually and not go away for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The umbrella review encompassed 248 individual meta-analyses, which synthesized data from over 200 controlled clinical trials involving more than 10,000 autistic people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review evaluated the evidence for 19 complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine (CAIM) interventions, including oxytocin therapy, melatonin, music therapy, animal-assisted therapy and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also considered polyunsaturated fatty acids, dietary supplements theorized to support brain health, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive technique that uses a mild electrical current to modulate brain activity, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), another non-invasive method that uses magnetic pulses to stimulate or inhibit specific brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brain stimulation techniques may help autism by modulating abnormal neural activity, either stimulating underactive areas or inhibiting overactive ones, and improving communication and synchronization between brain regions involved in social, communication, and cognitive functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The analysis also included a wide range of other therapies, such as secretin, a hormone traditionally produced in the small intestine that plays a role in regulating the digestive system. It was used in the 1990s as an experimental treatment for autism, based on the idea that it might improve gastrointestinal issues and, consequently, behavioral symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also investigated acupuncture, Chinese medicine, including herbal mixtures and therapeutic massage, various diets, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research found that, on average, 54 percent of autistic people use some form of CAIM. In some studies, this figure was as high as 92 percent over a person's lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers added: ‘However, many studies and international clinical guidelines indicate a lack of efficacy—and, in some cases, adverse events—for this type of intervention in autism.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The analysis evaluated alternative treatments based on their impact on both core symptoms of autism and a wide range of associated behaviors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For core symptoms, the review included social communication impairments, restricted and repetitive behaviors, sensory challenges, and overall symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Oxytocin therapy had the strongest evidence but was largely ineffective, showing only a small reduction in repetitive behaviors for autistic adults (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Several other therapies, like music and animal-assisted interventions for children, magnetic stimulation for teens and physical activity for adults, showed promising results, but findings were supported by very low-quality evidence, making their true effectiveness uncertain (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review also measured effects on key associated outcomes such as disruptive behaviors, co-occurring conditions, such as anxiety, depression, and ADHD symptoms, adaptive functioning, cognitive abilities, quality of life, and language skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study specifically analyzed improvements in sleep quality and quantity as a secondary outcome of crucial importance, ‘given the significance of sleep for autistic individuals and their families that emerged from the screened papers,’ researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Samuele Cortese, NIHR Research Professor at the University of Southampton and co-senior author, said: ‘This study shows that when people want to know whether a treatment is effective, they shouldn’t just look at one single study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s essential to consider all the available evidence and how good that evidence is. Drawing conclusions from one low-quality study can be misleading.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also created &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ebiact-database.com/"&gt;an online platform&lt;/a&gt; to make it easier for people to see the evidence they generated on different CAIMS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their review WAS published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02256-9#Abs1"&gt;Nature Human Behavior.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Corentin Gosling, associate professor at the Paris Nanterre University and first author of the study, said: 'Ultimately, we hope this tool will support autistic people and practitioners in choosing together the best treatment.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The umbrella review did not explicitly recommend any specific therapies over alternative ones. Still, the researchers suggested that the standard of care should be behavioral, educational, and developmental therapies that have a strong evidence base.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2000, about 1 in 150 children received an ASD diagnosis; by 2020, that figure had &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14619253/america-autism-hotspots-data-rampant-epidemic.html"&gt;climbed to 1 in 31&lt;/a&gt;, a near-quadrupling that reflects both greater awareness and evolving diagnostic criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age for an autism diagnosis is five, though the vast majority of parents notice developmental delays or atypical behavior in their children, particularly around social skills, as early as two years old. And rates at which children are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14025037/autism-spiked-kids-young-adults-health-experts.html"&gt;being diagnosed have spiked&lt;/a&gt; in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2825472#:~:text=The%20ASD%20diagnosis%20rate%20was,6.3%20per%201000%20in%202022."&gt;a 2024 analysis&lt;/a&gt; of millions of health records, diagnosis rates climbed 175 percent from 2011 to 2022, increasing from 2.3 to 6.3 per 1,000 people across all age groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most significant rise was observed in young adults aged 26 to 34, whose rates jumped 450 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, children between the ages of five and eight continue to have the highest diagnosis rate, at 30 per 1,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A jump in diagnoses has largely been attributed to improvements in screening children, reduced stigma around the diagnosis and greater society-wide awareness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The precise cause of the condition remains unknown, recent studies indicate that environmental influences, such as exposure to pollution, maternal infections during pregnancy, and advanced parental age, may play a role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Even within the normal range we have a higher risk at low-normal potassium compared to high-normal.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: ‘We have a list of foods that we gave to the patients - white beets, beetroots, cabbage and so on are all high-content potassium-rich diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We did not recommend meat, which is also potassium rich, because it is also rich in sodium and counter-interacts the increase in potassium.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings of the POTCAST trial were simultaneously presented at the conference and published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients helped to increase their potassium intake saw their levels rise from under 4.3 mmol/L to 4.5mmol/L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Low potassium increases the risk of arrhythmias and heart failures and death&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some 6.7 per cent of the intervention group were hospitalised due to an irregular heartbeat and 3.5 per cent experienced heart failure, compared with 10.7 per cent and 5.5 per cent, respectively, in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, clinical director at the British Heart Foundation and consultant cardiologist, said: ‘Many people in the UK are living with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, commonly known as an ICD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘These automatically shock your heart if it goes into an abnormal and life-threatening rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘While having a shock may save your life, the experience can be unpleasant for some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This trial from Denmark found that increasing blood potassium levels into the high normal range in people with ICDs improved patient outcomes, and importantly reduced their chances of needing a shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If you’re advised by your doctor to improve your dietary potassium intake, you can do this by including more vegetables and fruit rich in potassium such as spinach, bananas or avocados in your diet, as well as pulses, fish, nuts, and seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Don’t be tempted to try to increase your potassium intake with supplements unless supervised by your doctor, as ending up with too high a potassium level is dangerous – for example it can cause cardiac arrest.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023/24 over 7,000 new ICDs were fitted in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Other key foods are spinach, lima beans, baked potato, yoghurt, banana and tuna&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the findings, dietitian Dr Carrie Ruxton said: ‘Everyone knows about cutting down on salt, but few people realise that increasing potassium is almost as important for preventing strokes and heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The European Food Safety Authority highlighted a lack of potassium across Europe as a major diet concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘In the UK, the latest National Diet and Nutrition Survey shows that a third of teenagers and a quarter of adults are at risk of potassium deficiency, with implications for blood pressure control and muscle function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We can do more individually to boost our potassium intakes by eating more fruit, vegetables and fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Fruit juices are particularly rich in potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘A study published in Nutrients found that starting the day with a glass of orange juice provides 10 to 15 per cent of our daily potassium needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Other key foods are spinach, lima beans, baked potato, yoghurt, banana and tuna.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A banana contains around 500mg of potassium, half a baked potato contains around 600mg and a cup of raw spinach around 450mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The National Institutes of Health recommends that adult males should consume 3,400mg of potassium daily and adult females should consume 2,600mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pregnant or breast feeding women should consume significantly less and should consult a specialist if concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically concentrations of potassium in the blood range from about 3.6 to 5.0 millimoles per litre (mmol/L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;DANE COUNTY, Wis. — The first West Nile virus human case in Dane County was confirmed Thursday, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/mosquito/wnv-data.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Wisconsin Department of Health Services&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1BXNAdMpmZ/" target="_blank"&gt;Public Health Madison and Dane County&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late July, the first West Nile virus human case was reported in Barron County. &lt;span&gt;Other human cases have been reported in Rusk and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Sheboygan counties.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For context, this virus is spread to humans and other animals through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes acquire WNV by feeding on infected birds. The virus is not spread directly from person to person, animal to animal, or animal to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;Most people infected with West Nile virus, about 80%, do not develop symptoms. Those who do typically experience mild illness, such as fever, headache, fatigue, muscle aches and rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are four human cases, two hospitalizations and zero deaths as of Friday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wisconsin DHS has a website that details how people can &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/mosquito/bite-prevention.htm?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank"&gt;avoid mosquito bites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;​COPYRIGHT 2025 BY CHANNEL 3000.

    &lt;p&gt;Two people have died from eating raw oysters that were contaminated with a flesh-eating bacteria, Louisiana health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vibrio vulnificus is a bacteria that occurs in warm coastal waters. It is more common between May and October. The bacteria can cause illness when an open wound is exposed to contaminated waters, or when a person eats raw or undercooked seafood. Oysters are particularly risky, state health officials &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/news/vibrio-vulnificus-2025" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;said in a July news release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria can cause life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis, which may result in limb amputation, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. About one in five people with a Vibrio vulnificus infection die, the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been 22 cases of Vibrio vulnificus infection in Louisiana residents, the state department of health said. All of the victims were hospitalized. Four people have died, the health department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the deaths were among people who had eaten raw Louisiana oysters. The other two deaths were among people who reported exposing an open wound to seawater. None of the victims have been identified. One of the victims who ate contaminated oysters was a Louisiana resident. The other lived out of state, the health department said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louisiana has been seeing a higher number of Vibrio vulnificus infections and deaths, the state's health department said. During the past 10 years, the state has seen an average of seven infections and one death per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk of the bacteria is rising due to &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flesh-eating-bacteria-vibrio-vulnificus-florida/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;warming oceans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Earlier this mont, Florida confirmed 13 cases of Vibrio vulnificus across 11 counties. Eight victims died, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/report-13-cases-of-flesh-eating-bacteria-eight-deaths-confirmed-in-florida/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;CBS Miami reported&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

That 4.6% absolute risk reduction (number needed to treat = 22) translated to a statistically significant 18% relative risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69-0.98; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; =.03). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both components contributed to this reduction. The hazard ratio was 0.86 for death (95% CI, 0.69-1.07) and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.69-1.05) for first hospitalization for heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subgroup analyses yielded a moderate signal for a heterogenous treatment effect in which the benefit from digitoxin appeared strongest in patients with more advanced heart failure. Effect sizes were greater in patients with systolic blood pressure &amp;lt; 120 mm Hg vs greater than 120 mm Hg, and with heart rate ≥ 75 bpm vs &amp;lt; 75 bpm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total hospitalizations occurred in around 70% of both the digitoxin and placebo groups. Unlike patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction, wherein hospitalizations for heart failure are a small fraction of total hospitalizations, in DIGIT-HF, hospitalizations for cardiac causes represented the majority of total hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serious adverse events occurred in 4.7% of patients in the digitoxin group vs 2.8% in the placebo group. There was no difference in &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/151907-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;sudden cardiac death&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Five Lessons &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harm signal debunked&lt;/strong&gt;. One clear message from this trial is the safety of cardiac glycosides. While a few more patients had adverse effects from digitoxin, all the important signals of harm (death, cardiac death, and hospitalizations) were better on digitoxin — similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199702203360801?logout=true" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;DIG trial&lt;/a&gt; nearly 30 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly every suggestion of harm from cardiac glycosides has stemmed from observational analyses marred by selection bias, wherein sicker patients get the glycoside. When patients are randomly assigned, no harm from cardiac glycosides is observed. This lesson transcends any specific therapy and should infuse us with caution in making causal claims from nonrandom comparisons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive results despite good background therapy&lt;/strong&gt;. Patients in DIGIT-HF were well-treated with contemporary heart failure therapy, including beta-blockers, renin-angiotensin blockade, angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (76%). Only 1 in 5 patients were on SGLT2 inhibitors due to the trial starting before approval of this drug class. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That the benefit occurred over and above baseline therapy complicates translation: Should patients with HFrEF now take five drugs rather than four? An even more provocative question: Since digitoxin costs almost nothing, should it be preferred in cost-constrained situations over SGLT2 inhibitors?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinically meaningful effect size&lt;/strong&gt;: An absolute risk reduction of nearly 5% in death and first heart failure hepatization compares favorably to the most recent &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1911303" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;SGLT2 inhibitor&lt;/a&gt; trials. And the signal appears even stronger in patients with lower blood pressure and higher heart rate. Considering the low cost of digitoxin only enhances the clinical meaningfulness of the effect size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slightly less than a third of patients in the trial had &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/151066-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt;. Subgroup analysis based on atrial fibrillation (AF) status revealed no significant difference in effect size. A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(14)61373-8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;meta-analysis of HF trials&lt;/a&gt; reported that beta-blocker benefit was isolated to patients with sinus rhythm. Perhaps patients with HFrEF and AF should receive cardiac glycosides for rate control before beta-blockers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statistical robustness is a concern&lt;/strong&gt;. DIGIT-HF had slow enrollment and lower-than-expected event rates despite having highly symptomatic patients with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 28%. This speaks to the benefits of modern HF therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upper bound on the hazard ratio for the primary endpoint was 0.98, nearly reaching 1.0, or no effect. The P-value, which tests how surprising the results were if you assumed no difference, was barely below the accepted (but arbitrary) threshold of.05. A handful of events in a different column would have yielded a “negative trial.” This differs from the SGLT2 inhibitor trials, which had highly persuasive P-values. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bayesian statisticians will tell you that the probability of benefit more than 0 is strong, but the probability of a 20% reduction in the primary outcome is not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 17 patients in the digitoxin arm and 8 in the placebo arm lost to follow-up. While that isn’t terrible, it is far more than the number of events it would have taken to change the results to nonsignificant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish I could tell you how to resolve the concern that the findings in DIGIT-HF could be noise rather than signal. But I can’t. The trialists made a great effort; the fact is that small numbers of events often add uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digitoxin is not digoxin. &lt;/strong&gt; In the US and other countries, only &lt;a href="https://reference.medscape.com/drug/lanoxin-digoxin-342432" class="cl_ref_drugs"&gt;digoxin&lt;/a&gt; is available. All cardiac glycosides bind to and inhibit the sodium-potassium ATPase pump (Na+/K+-ATPase) in cardiac myocytes. And both digoxin and digitoxin lead to similar effects: positive inotropy and neurohormonal modulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet there are important pharmacodynamic differences. Digitoxin is easier to use and leads to steadier blood levels. Unlike digoxin, digitoxin is less affected by renal impairment because it has additional enterohepatic clearance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is important when it comes to translating evidence outside of a trial environment where patients may not have the same access to surveillance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the small numbers of events in DIGIT-HF, even a tiny difference in clinical effects of digitoxin vs digoxin could be clinically meaningful. DIGIT-HF authors emphasize that the Dutch &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ejhf.3428" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;DECISION&lt;/a&gt; trial will test digoxin in patients with HFrEF. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would be reluctant to translate results in the carefully done DIGIT-HF to &lt;em&gt;routine&lt;/em&gt; use of digoxin in US healthcare systems, where many patients have poor access to drug monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting in the audience at ESC, I felt a burst of optimism about our field when Professor Udo Bavendiek presented the trial. DIGIT-HF began with a bold idea. Bold because mainstream thinking had turned against cardiac glycosides. Bold because the old drug class has no industry backing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet a neutral observer of the history of heart failure trials could see reason to be optimistic about the use of cardiac glycosides. How easy it was to forget that more than 90% of patients in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199605233342101" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;seminal carvedilol trial&lt;/a&gt; were on digoxin. Maybe the positive inotropy allowed beta-blockers to provide their benefit? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I worry a little about the statistical robustness issue but lean on my positive priors (digoxin reduced heart failure hospitalizations in the DIG trial), the large effect size, and the high likelihood that digitoxin benefit is greater than 0. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that regulators bring back digitoxin for US clinicians. I am also excited to be able to use digoxin in selected patients without people worrying that we are giving poison to our patients. And I eagerly await the Dutch-led digoxin trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What a great day for evidence-based cardiology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;John Mandrola, MD, practices cardiac electrophysiology in Louisville, Kentucky, and is a writer and podcaster for Medscape.

These are just two of the reasons that the signs of pancreas problems can slip by unnoticed or attributed to a different illness or condition. Considering that this is the norm, it doesn't come as much of a shock that pancreatic cancer has such a &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/pancreas.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:low survival rate;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;low survival rate&lt;/a&gt; and that problems like pancreatitis can be so difficult to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Part of the reason survival rates are so low is that identifying pancreatic cancer early is difficult," said &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/andrew-hendifar-546093.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Andrew Hendifar, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Andrew Hendifar, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, the medical director of pancreatic cancer at the Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Center in Los Angeles.

While symptoms of pancreas issues can be persnickety, both Dr. Epperly and Dr. Hendifar say there are a handful of warning signs that warrant a call to your doctor. Here are some of the biggest ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pale, floating stool&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice your stool is light colored and floating, that's a sign of poor nutrient absorption because of a pancreas malfunction. "The enzymes your pancreas produces help you digest fats in your diet," Dr. Hendifar explained. Along with breaking down fats, your pancreas helps your body absorb fat-soluble vitamins like A, E, and K, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When pancreatic disease messes with your organ's ability to properly manufacture those enzymes, the result is feces that looks paler and is less dense. You may also notice your poop is oily or greasy. "The toilet water will have a film that looks like oil," Dr. Hendifar said. That's the dietary fat your body failed to break down, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice your poop looks funky now and then, that's no reason to freak out. But if all or most of your bowel movements have these characteristics, let your doctor know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Radiating back pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abdominal pain is one of the most common symptoms of both pancreatic cancer and acute pancreatitis, which is a type of deadly inflammation, Dr. Hendifar said. But that pain manifests in different ways depending on the underlying condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the pain seems to start in your middle before "radiating" into your mid or lower back—and if it lingers for weeks—that may be a sign of pancreatic cancer, Dr. Epperly said. Also, if you've already seen your doctor and he or she has prescribed a type of drug called a proton-pump inhibitor—such as omeprazole (Prilosec) or esomeprazole (Nexium)—let your doc know if your symptoms don't improve. Dr. Hendifar said it's common for doctors to mistake pancreatic cancer–triggered pain for reflux or other GI issues, many of which a proton-pump inhibitor should help resolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if the pain comes on suddenly and is intense and focused in the middle of your abdomen, that's the type associated with acute pancreatitis (sudden, temporary inflammation of the pancreas), Dr. Epperly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, it's important to remember that a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of health issues—some serious, but many mild—can cause &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20514235/what-it-means-if-you-have-one-of-these-7-types-of-stomach-pains/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stomach aches or pain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;stomach aches or pain&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Hendifar added. But if either of the descriptions above sound familiar and you haven't found a way to get relief, it's best to give your doctor a call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;An unexpected diabetes diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21743-pancreas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pancreas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pancreas&lt;/a&gt; produces hormones like insulin and glucagon that help maintain healthy levels of sugar in your bloodstream. When the pancreas is imperiled, it's common for sufferers to develop &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20492087/difference-between-type-1-and-type-2-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Hendifar said, because the production of these hormones will be thrown out of whack. If your weight is under control and you eat a healthy diet, a new diabetes diagnosis should lead to a closer examination of your pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same holds for a diabetes sufferer who suddenly finds her disease harder to manage, even if she is doing all the right things. "Those sudden changes in diabetes status without an obvious explanation, those are things we see associated with pancreatic cancer," Dr. Hendifar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nausea from high-fat foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nausea and vomiting are symptoms to watch out for—particularly if you've been eating fatty foods, Dr. Hendifar said. Again, because your pancreas produces enzymes that help your digestive system break down fat, diseases that mess with your pancreas tend to disrupt your body's fat-digesting capabilities, which leads to nausea. "Hamburgers are often nausea triggers, and so are avocados and nuts, which are all high in fat," Dr. Hendifar added. "Pizza is another one that's really tough for patients with a compromised pancreas." Dr. Epperly said pancreatitis is more likely than pancreatic cancer to lead to sudden vomiting and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rapid weight loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's tempting to credit your new diet, especially if you're actively trying to lose weight. But if you're shedding weight—and especially if you're experiencing the radiating pain described above—that weight loss could be due to the digestive issues associated with pancreatic cancer or disease, Dr. Hendifar said.

Their habits, behaviors, and personality may have shifted slightly, but it can be difficult to piece together what they're feeling if they're not explicitly expressing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, pieces of our daily lives — like our home or the cars we drive — can be more insightful for partners and friends. In fact, if you notice these things in your wife's car, she's struggling more than she admits. Like our bedrooms or living rooms, we spend a ton of time in our cars, and when we're struggling, this might be one of the first places to show it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If you notice these 11 things in your wife's car, she's struggling more than she admits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Tons of trash or clutter&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-08/if-you-notice-these-things-in-your-wifes-car-struggling-more-she-admits-tons-trash-clutter.png" alt="woman sitting in a car with trash and clutter around her" title="tons of trash or clutter if you notice these things in your wife's car she's struggling more than she admits" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Motortion Films | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0896627324006937" rel="nofollow"&gt;a study from the journal Neuron&lt;/a&gt;, visual clutter alters the flow and cognition of information in our brain. So, if we're constantly surrounded by clutter, trash, and visual overwhelm, our brain is inevitably going to struggle with otherwise basic tasks like concentration, memory, and communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a deeper level, this clutter can make internal processes like emotional regulation more difficult. You're also operating from a baseline level of stress, anxiety, and overwhelm that visual clutter cultivates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you consistently notice these things in your wife's car, she's struggling more than she admits — not only because it's clear she doesn't have the time or energy to clean, but because the &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/ways-clutter-home-making-you-sick"&gt;clutter itself sets her up for a number of concerns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/constant-clutter-drains-you-need-these-things-stay-sane"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If Constant Clutter Drains You, You Probably Need These 5 Things To Stay Sane&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

So, it's not necessarily an immediate sign of internal struggle if your wife has engine lights or oil change needs in her car, but it could be a sign that she needs help managing her workload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If she doesn't have the time or energy to get an oil change while managing everything else going on in her life, it might be time to rediscuss responsibilities and find a better balance that supports both partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/love/meaningful-conversations-strong-marriages-built-on"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Meaningful Conversations That Strong Marriages Are Built On, According To Experts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3.

They throw things into hidden spaces and push all their visual clutter out of sight, but they also tend to do the same internally — suffering quietly and &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/heartbreak/struggles-only-people-who-suppress-their-emotions-understand"&gt;suppressing their complex struggles, emotions, and concerns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, suppressing emotions doesn't make them go away — they demand to be addressed and acknowledged, similar to the full trunk of a car or an overflowing closet — but it does set these women up for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3939772/" rel="nofollow"&gt;a number of physical and mental health concerns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-immediately-make-people-feel-uncomfortable-someone-elses-car"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Things That Immediately Make People Feel Uncomfortable In Someone Else's Car&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5.

If you notice crumbs and stains from eating in your wife's car, she may be struggling more than she admits — struggling to find time for mindful eating at home, cooking and making nutritious meals, and crafting her day without rushing around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could be a sign that she needs support with responsibilities, but it could also be a red flag that she's struggling with her eating habits. If she's always finding comfort or solace in fast food in her car or overconsumption outside of the house, it could be time for a conversation about better habits, support, or even professional help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/ways-people-tell-your-house-dirty-even-if-you-clean-before-come-over"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Ways People Can Tell Your House Is Dirty, Even If You Clean Up Before They Come Over&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6.

Why do some people with Alzheimer's-like changes in the brain never go on to develop dementia? These questions have bedeviled neuroscientists for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a team of researchers at Harvard Medical School may have found an answer: lithium deficiency in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work, published Aug. 6 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, shows for the first time that lithium occurs naturally in the brain, shields it from neurodegeneration, and maintains the normal function of all major brain cell types. The findings -- 10 years in the making -- are based on a series of experiments in mice and on analyses of human brain tissue and blood samples from individuals in various stages of cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that lithium loss in the human brain is one of the earliest changes leading to Alzheimer's, while in mice, similar lithium depletion accelerated brain pathology and memory decline. The team further found that reduced lithium levels stemmed from binding to amyloid plaques and impaired uptake in the brain. In a final set of experiments, the team found that a novel lithium compound that avoids capture by amyloid plaques restored memory in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results unify decades-long observations in patients, providing a new theory of the disease and a new strategy for early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affecting an estimated 400 million people worldwide, Alzheimer's disease involves an array of brain abnormalities -- such as clumps of the protein amyloid beta, neurofibrillary tangles of the protein tau, and loss of a protective protein called REST -- but these never explained the full story of the disease. For instance, some people with such abnormalities show no signs of cognitive decline. And recently developed treatments that target amyloid beta typically don't reverse memory loss and only modestly reduce the rate of decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also clear that genetic and environmental factors affect risk of Alzheimer's, but scientists haven't figured out why some people with the same risk factors develop the disease while others don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium, the study authors said, may be a critical missing link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The idea that lithium deficiency could be a cause of Alzheimer's disease is new and suggests a different therapeutic approach," said senior author Bruce Yankner, professor of genetics and neurology in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS, who in the 1990s was the first to demonstrate that amyloid beta is toxic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study raises hopes that researchers could one day use lithium to treat the disease in its entirety rather than focusing on a single facet such as amyloid beta or tau, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main discoveries in the study is that as amyloid beta begins to form deposits in the early stages of dementia in both humans and mouse models, it binds to lithium, reducing lithium's function in the brain. The lower lithium levels affect all major brain cell types and, in mice, give rise to changes recapitulating Alzheimer's disease, including memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors identified a class of lithium compounds that can evade capture by amyloid beta. Treating mice with the most potent amyloid-evading compound, called lithium orotate, reversed Alzheimer's disease pathology, prevented brain cell damage, and restored memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the findings need to be confirmed in humans through clinical trials, they suggest that measuring lithium levels could help screen for early Alzheimer's. Moreover, the findings point to the importance of testing amyloid-evading lithium compounds for treatment or prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other lithium compounds are already used to treat bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, but they are given at much higher concentrations that can be toxic, especially to older people. Yankner's team found that lithium orotate is effective at one-thousandth that dose -- enough to mimic the natural level of lithium in the brain. Mice treated for nearly their entire adult lives showed no evidence of toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You have to be careful about extrapolating from mouse models, and you never know until you try it in a controlled human clinical trial," Yankner said. "But so far the results are very encouraging."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lithium depletion is an early sign of Alzheimer's &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yankner became interested in lithium while using it to study the neuroprotective protein REST. Finding out whether lithium is found in the human brain and whether its levels change as neurodegeneration develops and progresses, however, required access to brain tissue, which generally can't be accessed in living people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the lab partnered with the Rush Memory and Aging Project in Chicago, which has a bank of postmortem brain tissue donated by thousands of study participants across the full spectrum of cognitive health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having that range was critical because trying to study the brain in the late stages of Alzheimer's is like looking at a battlefield after a war, said Yankner; there's a lot of damage and it's hard to tell how it all started. But in the early stages, "before the brain is badly damaged, you can get important clues," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by first author Liviu Aron, senior research associate in the Yankner Lab, the team used an advanced type of mass spectroscopy to measure trace levels of about 30 different metals in the brain and blood of cognitively healthy people, those in an early stage of dementia called mild cognitive impairment, and those with advanced Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium was the only metal that had markedly different levels across groups and changed at the earliest stages of memory loss. Its levels were high in the cognitively healthy donors but greatly diminished in those with mild impairment or full-blown Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team replicated its findings in samples obtained from multiple brain banks nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observation aligned with previous population studies showing that higher lithium levels in the environment, including in drinking water, tracked with lower rates of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the new study went beyond by directly observing lithium in the brains of people who hadn't received lithium as a treatment, establishing a range that constitutes normal levels, and demonstrating that lithium plays an essential role in brain physiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Lithium turns out to be like other nutrients we get from the environment, such as iron and vitamin C," Yankner said. "It's the first time anyone's shown that lithium exists at a natural level that's biologically meaningful without giving it as a drug."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Yankner and colleagues took things a step further. They demonstrated in mice that lithium depletion isn't merely linked to Alzheimer's disease -- it helps drive it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss of lithium causes the range of Alzheimer's-related changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that feeding healthy mice a lithium-restricted diet brought their brain lithium levels down to a level similar to that in patients with Alzheimer's disease. This appeared to accelerate the aging process, giving rise to brain inflammation, loss of synaptic connections between neurons, and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Alzheimer's mouse models, depleted lithium dramatically accelerated the formation of amyloid-beta plaques and structures that resemble neurofibrillary tangles. Lithium depletion also activated inflammatory cells in the brain called microglia, impairing their ability to degrade amyloid; caused the loss of synapses, axons, and neuron-protecting myelin; and accelerated cognitive decline and memory loss -- all hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mouse experiments further revealed that lithium altered the activity of genes known to raise or lower risk of Alzheimer's, including the most well-known, &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replenishing lithium by giving the mice lithium orotate in their water reversed the disease-related damage and restored memory function, even in older mice with advanced disease. Notably, maintaining stable lithium levels in early life prevented Alzheimer's onset -- a finding that confirmed that lithium fuels the disease process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What impresses me the most about lithium is the widespread effect it has on the various manifestations of Alzheimer's. I really have not seen anything quite like it all my years of working on this disease," said Yankner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A promising avenue for Alzheimer's treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few limited clinical trials of lithium for Alzheimer's disease have shown some efficacy, but the lithium compounds they used -- such as the clinical standard, lithium carbonate -- can be toxic to aging people at the high doses normally used in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new research explains why: Amyloid beta was sequestering these other lithium compounds before they could work. Yankner and colleagues found lithium orotate by developing a screening platform that searches a library of compounds for those that might bypass amyloid beta. Other researchers can now use the platform to seek additional amyloid-evading lithium compounds that might be even more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One of the most galvanizing findings for us was that there were profound effects at this exquisitely low dose," Yankner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If replicated in further studies, the researchers say lithium screening through routine blood tests may one day may offer a way to identify individuals at risk for Alzheimer's who would benefit from treatment to prevent or delay disease onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying lithium levels in people who are resistant to Alzheimer's as they age might help scientists establish a target level that they could help patients maintain to prevent onset of the disease, Yankner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since lithium has not yet been shown to be safe or effective in protecting against neurodegeneration in humans, Yankner emphasizes that people should not take lithium compounds on their own. But he expressed cautious optimism that lithium orotate or a similar compound will move forward into clinical trials in the near future and could ultimately change the story of Alzheimer's treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My hope is that lithium will do something more fundamental than anti-amyloid or anti-tau therapies, not just lessening but reversing cognitive decline and improving patients' lives," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

It examined the proportion of people in those couples who had one of nine psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), substance-use disorder and anorexia nervosa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists lack a definitive understanding of what causes people to develop psychiatric disorders — but genetics and environmental factors are both thought to play a part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that when one partner was diagnosed with one of the nine conditions, the other was significantly more likely to be diagnosed with the same or another psychiatric condition. Spouses were more likely to have the same conditions than to have different ones, says co-author Chun Chieh Fan, a population and genetics researcher at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research in Tulsa, Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main result is that the pattern holds across countries, across cultures, and, of course, generations,” Fan says. Even changes in psychiatric care over the past 50 years have not shifted the trend, he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only OCD, bipolar disorder and anorexia nervosa showed different patterns across countries. For instance, in Taiwan, married couples were more likely to share OCD than were couples in Nordic countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study separated people into birth cohorts, from the 1930s to the 1990s, spanning ten-year intervals. For most disorders, the chances of partners sharing a diagnosis increased slightly with each decade, particularly for those with disorders related to substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s behind the trend?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study did not investigate what causes the phenomenon, Fan says three theories could help to explain it. First, people might be attracted to those who resemble them. “Perhaps they better understand each other due to shared suffering, so they attract each other,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, a shared environment could make partners more alike — a process known as convergence. And third, the societal stigma of having a psychiatric disorder narrows a person’s choice of spouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan Fullerton, a psychiatric geneticist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, says that social and environmental stressors could contribute to a new diagnosis in a previously unaffected partner, particularly if they had milder, undiagnosed symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

These are just two of the reasons that the signs of pancreas problems can slip by unnoticed or attributed to a different illness or condition. Considering that this is the norm, it doesn't come as much of a shock that pancreatic cancer has such a &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/pancreas.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/pancreas.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="low survival rate" data-node-id="0.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;low survival rate&lt;/a&gt; and that problems like pancreatitis can be so difficult to deal with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;"Part of the reason survival rates are so low is that identifying pancreatic cancer early is difficult," said &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/andrew-hendifar-546093.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/andrew-hendifar-546093.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Andrew Hendifar, M.D." data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Andrew Hendifar, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, the medical director of pancreatic cancer at the Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Center in Los Angeles.

While symptoms of pancreas issues can be persnickety, both Dr. Epperly and Dr. Hendifar say there are a handful of warning signs that warrant a call to your doctor. Here are some of the biggest ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="pale-floating-stool" data-node-id="5" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;Pale, floating stool&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you notice your stool is light colored and floating, that's a sign of poor nutrient absorption because of a pancreas malfunction. "The enzymes your pancreas produces help you digest fats in your diet," Dr. Hendifar explained. Along with breaking down fats, your pancreas helps your body absorb fat-soluble vitamins like A, E, and K, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;When pancreatic disease messes with your organ's ability to properly manufacture those enzymes, the result is feces that looks paler and is less dense. You may also notice your poop is oily or greasy. "The toilet water will have a film that looks like oil," Dr. Hendifar said. That's the dietary fat your body failed to break down, he explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you notice your poop looks funky now and then, that's no reason to freak out. But if all or most of your bowel movements have these characteristics, let your doctor know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="radiating-back-pain" data-node-id="9" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;Radiating back pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Abdominal pain is one of the most common symptoms of both pancreatic cancer and acute pancreatitis, which is a type of deadly inflammation, Dr. Hendifar said. But that pain manifests in different ways depending on the underlying condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If the pain seems to start in your middle before "radiating" into your mid or lower back—and if it lingers for weeks—that may be a sign of pancreatic cancer, Dr. Epperly said. Also, if you've already seen your doctor and he or she has prescribed a type of drug called a proton-pump inhibitor—such as omeprazole (Prilosec) or esomeprazole (Nexium)—let your doc know if your symptoms don't improve. Dr. Hendifar said it's common for doctors to mistake pancreatic cancer–triggered pain for reflux or other GI issues, many of which a proton-pump inhibitor should help resolve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;On the other hand, if the pain comes on suddenly and is intense and focused in the middle of your abdomen, that's the type associated with acute pancreatitis  (sudden, temporary inflammation of the pancreas), Dr. Epperly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Still, it's important to remember that a &lt;em data-node-id="13.1"&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of health issues—some serious, but many mild—can cause &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20514235/what-it-means-if-you-have-one-of-these-7-types-of-stomach-pains/" target="_self" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20514235/what-it-means-if-you-have-one-of-these-7-types-of-stomach-pains/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="stomach aches or pain" data-node-id="13.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;stomach aches or pain&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Hendifar added. But if either of the descriptions above sound familiar and you haven't found a way to get relief, it's best to give your doctor a call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="an-unexpected-diabetes-diagnosis" data-node-id="14" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;An unexpected diabetes diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Your &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21743-pancreas" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21743-pancreas" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="pancreas" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;pancreas&lt;/a&gt; produces hormones like insulin and glucagon that help maintain healthy levels of sugar in your bloodstream. When the pancreas is imperiled, it's common for sufferers to develop &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20492087/difference-between-type-1-and-type-2-diabetes/" target="_self" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20492087/difference-between-type-1-and-type-2-diabetes/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="type 2 diabetes" data-node-id="15.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Hendifar said, because the production of these hormones will be thrown out of whack. If your weight is under control and you eat a healthy diet, a new diabetes diagnosis should lead to a closer examination of your pancreas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The same holds for a diabetes sufferer who suddenly finds her disease harder to manage, even if she is doing all the right things. "Those sudden changes in diabetes status without an obvious explanation, those are things we see associated with pancreatic cancer," Dr. Hendifar said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="nausea-from-high-fat-foods" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;Nausea from high-fat foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Nausea and vomiting are symptoms to watch out for—particularly if you've been eating fatty foods, Dr. Hendifar said. Again, because your pancreas produces enzymes that help your digestive system break down fat, diseases that mess with your pancreas tend to disrupt your body's fat-digesting capabilities, which leads to nausea. "Hamburgers are often nausea triggers, and so are avocados and nuts, which are all high in fat," Dr. Hendifar added. "Pizza is another one that's really tough for patients with a compromised pancreas." Dr. Epperly said pancreatitis is more likely than pancreatic cancer to lead to sudden vomiting and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="rapid-weight-loss" data-node-id="19" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;Rapid weight loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It's tempting to credit your new diet, especially if you're actively trying to lose weight. But if you're shedding weight—and especially if you're experiencing the radiating pain described above—that weight loss could be due to the digestive issues associated with pancreatic cancer or disease, Dr. Hendifar said.

These are just two of the reasons that the signs of pancreas problems can slip by unnoticed or attributed to a different illness or condition. Considering that this is the norm, it doesn't come as much of a shock that pancreatic cancer has such a &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/pancreas.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:low survival rate;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;low survival rate&lt;/a&gt; and that problems like pancreatitis can be so difficult to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Part of the reason survival rates are so low is that identifying pancreatic cancer early is difficult," said &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/andrew-hendifar-546093.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Andrew Hendifar, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Andrew Hendifar, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, the medical director of pancreatic cancer at the Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Center in Los Angeles.

While symptoms of pancreas issues can be persnickety, both Dr. Epperly and Dr. Hendifar say there are a handful of warning signs that warrant a call to your doctor. Here are some of the biggest ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Pale, floating stool&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you notice your stool is light colored and floating, that's a sign of poor nutrient absorption because of a pancreas malfunction. "The enzymes your pancreas produces help you digest fats in your diet," Dr. Hendifar explained. Along with breaking down fats, your pancreas helps your body absorb fat-soluble vitamins like A, E, and K, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When pancreatic disease messes with your organ's ability to properly manufacture those enzymes, the result is feces that looks paler and is less dense. You may also notice your poop is oily or greasy. "The toilet water will have a film that looks like oil," Dr. Hendifar said. That's the dietary fat your body failed to break down, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you notice your poop looks funky now and then, that's no reason to freak out. But if all or most of your bowel movements have these characteristics, let your doctor know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Radiating back pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Abdominal pain is one of the most common symptoms of both pancreatic cancer and acute pancreatitis, which is a type of deadly inflammation, Dr. Hendifar said. But that pain manifests in different ways depending on the underlying condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If the pain seems to start in your middle before "radiating" into your mid or lower back—and if it lingers for weeks—that may be a sign of pancreatic cancer, Dr. Epperly said. Also, if you've already seen your doctor and he or she has prescribed a type of drug called a proton-pump inhibitor—such as omeprazole (Prilosec) or esomeprazole (Nexium)—let your doc know if your symptoms don't improve. Dr. Hendifar said it's common for doctors to mistake pancreatic cancer–triggered pain for reflux or other GI issues, many of which a proton-pump inhibitor should help resolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On the other hand, if the pain comes on suddenly and is intense and focused in the middle of your abdomen, that's the type associated with acute pancreatitis (sudden, temporary inflammation of the pancreas), Dr. Epperly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, it's important to remember that a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of health issues—some serious, but many mild—can cause &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20514235/what-it-means-if-you-have-one-of-these-7-types-of-stomach-pains/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stomach aches or pain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;stomach aches or pain&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Hendifar added. But if either of the descriptions above sound familiar and you haven't found a way to get relief, it's best to give your doctor a call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;An unexpected diabetes diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Your &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21743-pancreas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pancreas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;pancreas&lt;/a&gt; produces hormones like insulin and glucagon that help maintain healthy levels of sugar in your bloodstream. When the pancreas is imperiled, it's common for sufferers to develop &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20492087/difference-between-type-1-and-type-2-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Hendifar said, because the production of these hormones will be thrown out of whack. If your weight is under control and you eat a healthy diet, a new diabetes diagnosis should lead to a closer examination of your pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The same holds for a diabetes sufferer who suddenly finds her disease harder to manage, even if she is doing all the right things. "Those sudden changes in diabetes status without an obvious explanation, those are things we see associated with pancreatic cancer," Dr. Hendifar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Nausea from high-fat foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nausea and vomiting are symptoms to watch out for—particularly if you've been eating fatty foods, Dr. Hendifar said. Again, because your pancreas produces enzymes that help your digestive system break down fat, diseases that mess with your pancreas tend to disrupt your body's fat-digesting capabilities, which leads to nausea. "Hamburgers are often nausea triggers, and so are avocados and nuts, which are all high in fat," Dr. Hendifar added. "Pizza is another one that's really tough for patients with a compromised pancreas." Dr. Epperly said pancreatitis is more likely than pancreatic cancer to lead to sudden vomiting and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Rapid weight loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It's tempting to credit your new diet, especially if you're actively trying to lose weight. But if you're shedding weight—and especially if you're experiencing the radiating pain described above—that weight loss could be due to the digestive issues associated with pancreatic cancer or disease, Dr. Hendifar said.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This study is a clear reminder that we need to carefully consider the risks of using multiple medications, particularly in aged care where residents are often prescribed a mix of long-term treatments.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'This doesn't mean we should stop using these medications, but we do need to be more mindful about how they interact with antibiotics, and that includes looking beyond just two-drug combinations.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, researchers tested acetaminophen, commonly used to relieve fevers, and ibuprofen, commonly found in flu medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other drugs tested in the study included diclofenac, an arthritis treatment, furosemid, to treat high blood pressure, metformin, to control high blood sugar, atorvastatin, to reduce cholesterol, tramadol, a strong painkiller, temazepam, used to treat sleep problems, and pseudoephedrine, a decongestant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These drugs contain different active ingredients and do not contain acetaminophen or ibuprofen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists placed the drugs in a petri dish alongside varying concentrations of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, the first-line of defense against bacterial infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacteria E.coli, commonly found in human intestines and often behind recalls of contaminated food, was added and the dishes were heated for 20 hours to&lt;span&gt; 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius), to mirror the temperature in the human body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Results showed that when bacteria were exposed to ciprofloxacin alongside acetaminophen and ibuprofen, the bacteria developed more mutations than when just exposed to ciprofloxacin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This helped the bacteria grow faster and become highly resistant to the antibiotic, as well as to multiple antibiotics from different classes.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mol-fe-xpmodule-comment-cta="true" data-article-id="15043123" data-channel="health" data-environment="production" data-platform="mol.web.desktop" data-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15043123/painkiller-advil-tylenol-antibiotic-resistance.html" data-version="1.1.4" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the lab tests, the scientists used E.coli, a common bacteria often found in the human gastrointestinal tract (stock photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 9.9million people are prescribed ibuprofen in the US every year, estimates suggest, with millions of others taking the drug over the counter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An estimated 52million people take acetaminophen in the US every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC said there are about 2.8million antibiotic resistant infections in the US every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 35,000 people also die from these infections annually, according to estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The World Health Organization had previously warned that antibiotic resistance 'threatens the effective prevention and treatment of an ever-increasing range of infections' and that it is 'an urgent public health threat'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infections that are resistant to these drugs are often referred to as 'super infections'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was revealed in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44259-025-00144-w#Sec14"&gt;Nature: Antimicrobials and Resistance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eggs are an obvious choice at breakfast—one 100-gram serving contains 10.7 grams of protein&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Feeling stumped about what else to eat? Below are the top breakfast foods that have even more protein than eggs. As portion sizes differ, protein was determined for a 100-gram serving.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein content: 20.8 grams&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Slather it on sprouted bread for toast (another high-protein option) or add it to your overnight oats. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein content: 18.3 grams&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Salmon is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are good for heart health and may help lower one’s risk of coronary heart disease&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Smoking does reduce the amount of fatty acids, somewhat, with research showing that hot-smoked preparation&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; may reduce fatty acids more than cold-smoked. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-teff-porridge"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Teff Porridge &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein content: 13.3 grams&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Haddley suggests using teff for a new take on porridge. “Teff is one of the highest-protein grains, naturally gluten-free, and rich in iron, calcium, and magnesium—nutrients many people fall short on,” she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-sprouted-tofu-scramble"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Sprouted Tofu Scramble &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein content: 13.2 grams&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a plant-based egg-inspired dish, try making a scramble with sprouted tofu, which contains more protein than regular tofu. “Tofu is a great plant-based protein option and it is low in saturated fat and cholesterol-free,” says Vanessa Rissetto, registered dietitian and CEO and founder of virtual nutrition care platform, Culina Health. She recommends sautéing it with turmeric (for color), along with garlic, onions, and veggies. “For that cheesy flavor, add in nutritional yeast and a B12 boost,” Rissetto recommends.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-sprouted-toast"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Sprouted Toast &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein content: 13.2 grams
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Toast can be a great protein-filled option if you choose the right kind of bread. “Sprouted bread offers more bioavailable nutrients and a bit more protein than traditional bread,” Hadley says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-steel-cut-oatmeal"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Steel-Cut Oatmeal &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Oats, particularly steel-cut oats, are full of fiber and protein. Oats can help improve gut bacteria and help you maintain healthy cholesterol levels. For easy prep, you can make overnight oats for a grab-and-go breakfast. Rissetto recommends using a one-to-one ratio of milk to oats and topping with berries, nuts, cinnamon, or almond butter. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Cottage cheese is rich in protein and calcium, but it typically has even more protein per serving than Greek yogurt,” Hadley says. “Cottage cheese is also lower in carbs, making it a great option for those who want higher protein without the extra lactose.” Eat it plain, top with fruit, or include it in another meal for a protein boost. “Try mixing it into pancake batter for a protein boost, stirring it into scrambled eggs for extra creaminess, or blending it into smoothies for a rich, cheesecake-like texture,” Hadley says.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rabbits with horn-like growths shooting out of their heads and faces have been spotted in northern Wisconsin and other states, inspiring an internet frenzy over the “mutant” bunnies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sightings of the unfortunate furry critters occur every year, but they’ve sparked national attention after photos of the bunnies in Colorado went viral this month. On social media, people have dubbed the rabbits “&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1mqq35k/my_girlfriend_saw_this_frankenstein_bunny_in/"&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/a&gt;” bunnies or likened them to zombies in the HBO series “The Last of Us.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While they may look like something out of a horror flick, disease experts say the virus causing the wart-like growths isn’t a sign of the end times. The rabbits are infected with the Shope papillomavirus, according to Nancy Businga, wildlife disease specialist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“That can, of course, be very eye-catching and very strange-looking to people that haven’t seen it before. And we do, every year, get a few random reports of these rabbits with these lesions,” Businga said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Businga said there’s been a slight uptick in sightings this year in northwestern Wisconsin. The agency has received eight reports of 23 rabbits in St. Croix, Dunn, Pierce and Polk counties. Last year, the agency only received one report of the virus affecting rabbits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul Lambert is an oncology professor and director of the McArdle Lab for Cancer Research at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. Lambert, who studies human papillomavirus, said the Shope virus was the first tumor virus ever discovered. American physician and animal pathologist &lt;a href="https://www.rockefeller.edu/our-scientists/richard-e-shope/2332-albert-lasker-award/"&gt;Richard E. Shope&lt;/a&gt; first identified the virus in the 1930s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is not a bloodborne pathogen,” Lambert said. “This virus, papillomaviruses, is transmitted by exposure on the skin.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lambert said the virus is mostly benign and the warts usually go away as the animal’s immune system fights off the infection. In a small percentage of humans, infections may not resolve from sexually transmitted human papillomaviruses and could pose a risk of cancer.  More than &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4517131/"&gt;300 papillomaviruses&lt;/a&gt; have been identified, including more than 200 human papillomaviruses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is not new. It’s just that pictures of these rabbits draw interest because they look kind of bizarre,” Lambert said. “The &lt;a href="https://www.si.edu/stories/worlds-scariest-rabbit"&gt;jackalope&lt;/a&gt; has been around for as long as I can remember and as a mystical creature that was to reflect the taxidermist version of these rabbits with horns.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kristen Bernard, a virology professor at the University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine, said the Shope virus cannot be transmitted to humans. However, she said, the virus can be transmitted by insects and ticks among wildlife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s because when the insect bites that area of an animal to blood feed like a tick does, like a mosquito does, it gets the virus on its mouth parts, and then goes and feeds on another animal and transmits the virus mechanically that way,” Bernard said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Businga said an increase in sightings of the virus may be tied to warmer weather for a longer portion of the year, which is favorable for insects like mosquitoes and ticks. While some have speculated that climate change may play a role in increased sightings, Lambert said evidence is lacking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I believe in climate change, but I’m not aware of any epidemiological study that has demonstrated that climate change is increasing the incidence of papillomavirus infections in animals or in humans,” Lambert said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bernard said there is evidence of diseases from ticks and mosquitoes spreading due to climate change, but it’s anyone’s guess whether it’s playing a role in the spread of the Shope virus among rabbits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I wouldn’t say there’s strong evidence, but I wouldn’t be surprised if climate change increased the amount of this in the summer months due to that mechanical transmission by insects,” Bernard said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rabbits aren’t the only animals in Wisconsin that have been spotted with growths due to papillomaviruses. People have also reported a few sightings of papillomaviruses  in deer and a couple affecting squirrels this year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If people spot animals with papillomaviruses, Bernard urged them to use caution when handling sick wildlife. While the virus can’t be transmitted to humans or pets, rabbits may have other diseases that can spread to humans including tularemia or rabbit fever. They can also infect domestic rabbits with the virus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People can report sick wildlife to the DNR by filling out a form on the agency’s &lt;a href="https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/WildlifeHabitat/wildlifehealth"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; or by calling 608-267-0866.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: The story has been updated to more accurately reflect comments from the DNR’s Nancy Businga on warmer weather possibly affecting the spread of the Shope papillomavirus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Treating &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/10k-steps-a-day-walking-b2735565.html"&gt;10,000 steps per day&lt;/a&gt; as the gold standard for a healthy lifestyle is far more contentious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number stems from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer called the Manpo-Kei, or “10,000 steps metre”. It’s a nice round number, but it’s not one identified by science as the holy grail for health – a 2023 study by the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ugr.es/en/about/news/how-many-steps-take-each-day-reduce-risk-premature-death8000"&gt;University of Granada&lt;/a&gt; suggests that, while more is better, 8,000 is sufficient “to significantly reduce the risk of premature death”​​. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/walking"&gt;Walking&lt;/a&gt; 10,000 steps also takes a fair old while. Even at a decent nick, this task is likely to take you upwards of 90 minutes each day, making it a struggle for busy folks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-31azim-0 eBMXOi nextSwipeIgnore"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU sc-wlmftc-0 ccDPKb"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-hKDTPf hmBpZX"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7Ehvq-bm6I"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, an alternative walking protocol – colloquially termed “Japanese walking” due to its country of origin – has stepped into the spotlight online. It takes just 30 minutes per day, with fitness coach and content creator &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/coacheugeneteo/?hl=en"&gt;Eugene Teo&lt;/a&gt; claiming it offers “10 times the benefits” of walking 10,000 steps per day in his viral video above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fitness writer, I’ve covered walking extensively, finding it’s one of the best ways to help people of all fitness levels introduce more movement into their regular routine. So, intrigued, I endeavoured to try “Japanese walking” and find out if the impressive health claims around it held water.&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/K7Ehvq-bm6I"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to try the ‘Japanese walking’ method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete the sequence below five times without any breaks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 dDVXDN jHvNZk"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three minutes of walking at a low intensity (40 per cent peak aerobic capacity, or a relaxed pace) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three minutes of walking at a high intensity (70 per cent peak aerobic capacity, or a brisk pace) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Japanese walking” protocol comes from a study published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17605959/"&gt;Mayo Clinic Proceedings&lt;/a&gt; journal in 2007. It was designed to test whether high-intensity interval walking training (IWT) can offer greater benefits than moderate-intensity continuous walking training, in terms of improving thigh muscle strength, peak aerobic capacity (the maximum amount of oxygen you can take in and use during exercise) and blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over five months, 60 men and 186 women with an average age of 63 were divided into three groups; no walking training, IWT and CWT (continuous walking training). The CWT group was instructed to walk at 50 per cent of their peak aerobic capacity (a fairly slow pace) and take 8,000 or more steps per day at least four times per week. The IWT group was told to complete the protocol above, four or more times per week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among participants who met these conditions, those in the IWT group saw a 13 per cent increase in isometric knee flexion, a 17 per cent increase in isometric knee flexion, and an eight per cent increase in peak aerobic capacity for walking. This was “significantly greater than the increases observed in the moderate-intensity continuous walking training group”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also found a greater reduction in resting systolic blood pressure in the IWT group, despite the fact they didn’t spend as much time walking each week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion states: “high-intensity interval walking may protect against age-associated increases in blood pressure and decreases in thigh muscle strength and peak aerobic capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/japanese-walking-trend-weight-loss-b2759539.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The latest walking trend that could help burn more calories and lower blood pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/japanese-walking-trend-weight-loss-b2759539.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 iBjbcX"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Walking is one of the most accessible forms of movement, offering impressive health benefits" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-66833"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Walking is one of the most accessible forms of movement, offering impressive health benefits&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (David Lovelady)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened when I tried Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a full science lab set up at home; what I do have is two legs, a &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-garmin-watch-b1903982.html"&gt;Garmin watch&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of walking experience, so I decided to put these to good use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my Monday lunch break, I took my dog for a 30-minute walk as normal. Then, at 1pm the following day, I tried the “Japanese walking” method on the same looped route, setting my Garmin Vivoactive to record both sessions and taking note of any subjective changes I felt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My usual 30-minute walk saw me accrue nearly 3,000 steps, covering 2.12km at an average speed of 14min 10sec per kilometre. My heart rate averaged 85bpm, remaining fairly constant throughout, and I burned an estimated 157 calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As anyone who has owned a dog might expect, there was a good deal of stopping and starting to inspect particularly interesting trees and bollards, and I defaulted to a fairly casual pace amid a busy work day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Japanese walking protocol, my numbers looked a bit different, with my fast pace falling just below 120 steps per minute and my slow pace a few shy of 100 steps per minute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I travelled significantly further, covering 2.94km and 3,500 steps at an average speed of 10min 12sec per kilometre. My average heart rate came out very similar (86bpm) but there were noticeable peaks (104bpm) and troughs in line with the high- and low-speed intervals. My estimated calorie burn was also significantly higher: 211. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/how-many-steps-a-day-cancer-risk-b2756669.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many steps to take each day to slash your risk of cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/how-many-steps-a-day-cancer-risk-b2756669.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the Japanese walking method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that walking faster, or sprinkling more intensity into your exercise, holds greater benefits is nothing new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialist in walking for health, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://education.ua.edu/about/directory/faculty-directory/elroy-aguiar/"&gt;Dr Elroy Aguiar&lt;/a&gt;, is an assistant professor at the University of Alabama’s department of kinesiology. He was the lead author on a 2024 paper published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sms.14762"&gt;Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports&lt;/a&gt;, which correlated as little as one minute of high-intensity activity with improved health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the really interesting findings from our paper was that, if you look at people’s highest one minute of activity across each day, averaged across the monitoring period, that was a very strong signal for whether they had one or more metabolic syndrome risk factors [elevated waist circumference, high triglycerides, low HDL (or “good” cholesterol), high blood pressure and high blood sugar] present,” he tells me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another series of studies he worked on, featured in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29858465/"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, pointed to the fact that “if you walk at a cadence of about 100 steps per minute, that’s equivalent to what’s called ‘moderate-intensity’, and all of the research in this area suggests that most of the benefits [of walking] accumulate at a moderate or higher intensity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, completing the Japanese walking method four times per week leaves you half-an-hour away from the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity"&gt;World Health Organisation’s&lt;/a&gt; “global recommendations of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week”. Add a couple of short full-body &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; sessions into the mix and you have a decent &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/short-workouts-plan-fitness-dan-john-b2737277.html"&gt;minimalist workout plan&lt;/a&gt; for beginners. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/step-count-walking-benefits-10000-day-b2739534.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How your step count became the ultimate modern humblebrag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/step-count-walking-benefits-10000-day-b2739534.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 juTIZT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Completing the ‘Japanese walking’ method a few times each week sets you well on your way to hitting the World Health Organisation’s weekly physical activity guidelines" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-66834"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Completing the ‘Japanese walking’ method a few times each week sets you well on your way to hitting the World Health Organisation’s weekly physical activity guidelines&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Harry Bullmore/The Independent)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential drawbacks of the Japanese Walking method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the information above paints the Japanese walking method in a favourable light – as it should, with the protocol delivering impressive results in a non-intimidating time-span. However, if we are questioning the claim that it is “better” than walking 10,000 steps a day, there are a few further areas to consider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Dr Aguiar’s 2024 paper supported the idea that the “best” walking method for reducing metabolic risk factors involves a combination of high volume (number of steps) and high intensity (walking speed). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Accumulating a high volume of walking throughout the day [8,000-plus steps], then focussing on at least 30 minutes of faster walking or jogging, would be a way to move the metrics in a positive direction and lower your metrics for each of the [metabolic syndrome] risk factors,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I racked up a little over 3,500 steps when trying the Japanese Walking method – less than half of the 8,000 daily steps research has repeatedly linked to many favourable health outcomes, and short of the 5,000 mark often viewed as the threshold for a sedentary lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this method as part, rather than all, of your daily steps could be a better approach for achieving your health goals. However, if you only have 30 minutes per day free, it still offers dramatically more benefits than not moving at all, and improved return on investment over a regular 30-minute walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area where the Japanese walking method loses out to walking 10,000 steps per day is movement regularity. While the former involves a concentrated 30-minute dose of activity, the latter can be spread throughout the day, encouraging you to abandon your office chair and sofa more often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 10-year study of 8,000 people, published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30551177/"&gt;American Journal of Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;, found that those replaced 30 minutes of daily sitting with light activity had a 17 per cent lower risk of dying in that period. This even applied if they accrued these 30 minutes across short intervals throughout the day – hence why your smartwatch is constantly sending you reminders to stand up and move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular movement can also help maintain mobility and reduce stiffness in our joints and muscles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we’re dealing with an adaptation from stillness, movement is the answer, so any movement is better than just being still,” movement mechanics expert and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetrainingstimulus.com/"&gt;The Training Stimulus&lt;/a&gt; founder Ash Grossmann summarises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final factor to consider is enjoyment. By adding a rigid framework, Japanese walking ensures intensity. However, it also meant I was unable to stop and chat to people in the park or appreciate my surroundings to the same extent. For me, this lowered the stress-busting potential of my walk, sacrificing some of the usual mental health benefits of walking for physical ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/news/health/fart-walk-benefits-type-2-diabetes-cancer-b2744886.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the heck is a fart walk?

But if you can fit one or two quick full-body strength training sessions, regular aerobic activity (like walking) and an occasional dash of more intense exercise into each week, it will stand you in very good stead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is among the most accessible forms of exercise there is, lowering the barrier to entry for exercise for billions of people, which is why I’m always keen to promote it. However, in the modern world, even finding time for a quick walk can be tricky for particularly busy individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese walking method provides a time-savvy way to enjoy many of the benefits of a greater volume of daily walking. Sure, you could enjoy higher-intensity exercise in any number of other forms, from cycling to a HIIT workout, but walking remains the most efficient – you don’t even need a change of clothes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So should you try it? Yes, especially if you’re short on time and looking for a way to squeeze health-boosting movement into your day. And should you stick with it? This depends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy this framework, or find it’s something you can stick to with a good degree of regularity, that’s the ticket to a sustainable movement habit and the many health benefits that come from it. If not, look for an alternative form of moderate- to high-intensity exercise that you find fun, and commit to this instead – consistency is the key to long-term results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps day might not matter if you don’t do this one thing, according to an expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 09:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPQzhJSDYtNm5ma3YwTC00ck9Sb0JBdXE5TVREaVpobkVkdFowY3dOTjAxSEVXR0RUUElDeHZjVm9COUt3Q0drc0xsdF9Ga3JmOHpURzdYS2pXTUJhQUh3T0pRTzdHWER3OU1OUHZjNjZtdzNmMnZsT0ZoT3BnZU51bThvNE9QWXZyUXlxNkRCM0tIdDVkWVl4YzhXeHJmWTk2WUVJakxJSQ</guid></item><item><title>罗奇博士：神经外科医生拒绝为NPH患者分流-底特律新闻</title><link>https://www.detroitnews.com/story/life/advice/2025/08/29/dr-roach-neurosurgeon-refuses-to-put-in-a-shunt-for-person-with-nph/85757901007/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_by"&gt;Dr. Keith Roach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; I have normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) and had a spinal tap a few months ago. It helped my brain fog, but my neurosurgeon didn't want to put in a shunt. I am 96. Can repeated taps help me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— M.G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear M.G.:&lt;/strong&gt; NPH is a condition where the fluid inside the brain has a high pressure. It is unknown why this happens, but symptoms include an abnormal gait and incontinence along with the brain fog you mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When NPH is suspected, a spinal tap is a useful diagnostic test. Taking a lot of spinal fluid out, which suspends the brain and spinal cord, will temporarily lower the pressure, and if a person's symptoms (especially their walk) get immediately better, this is a strong sign that the diagnosis is NPH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Unfortunately the pressure builds back up within a few days, so the cure might be even worse than the disease if you needed a spinal tap every few days. There are no medications that have been proven to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;This leads me to wonder why your neurosurgeon didn't want to do the shunt, which is the definitive treatment for NPH. A shunt drains spinal fluid into the abdomen, allowing the pressure to stay low. It's the one treatment that improves a person's function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While I understand that operating on the brain at age 96 has the possibility for complications, NPH tends to worsen over time. Perhaps a second opinion would be wise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; I read a recent column where you addressed the perils of microplastic polymer particles. Please elaborate on which bodily illnesses/problems arise as a result of this problem and how it manifests itself within our body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— C.C.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear C.C.:&lt;/strong&gt; There aren't good studies that have yet determined the risk from microplastics. While they have been suspected of causing harm in multiple organ systems, the magnitude of the harm isn't well-understood in humans. In particular, the digestive system may be affected through chronic inflammation and changes in the microbiome. The lungs may have reduced gas exchange. There may be changes in male reproductive health, and there is concern but not proof of an increased cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I find it frustrating that there is information about the potential harms of microplastics but not enough good evidence to estimate what the risk might be. However, until these risks are better known, there are a few steps to help reduce exposure:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;— Change plastic water bottles for glass or steel. Tap water has less microplastics than bottled water.— Don't microwave foods in plastic.— Use glass or ceramic containers for storage.— Avoid highly processed foods.— Vacuum your living space with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter.— Use home-filtration devices that have very small filters (about 0.2 micrometers).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Most of this advice is good for either you or the environment (or both), so taking this advice won't be a waste. Most of the work that needs to be done to reduce microplastics in the environment needs to happen at a systems level. For example, among the largest root causes of microplastics is oceanic plastic debris. Solving this is beyond my capacity.&lt;em&gt;Readers may email questions to

known in scientific circles as Neurocysticercosis, is caused by pig tapeworms, which infect humans through either eating pork or consuming contaminated food and water.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

When Drury's son developed Pandas more than a decade ago, she was willing to pay thousands of dollars for his first IVIG treatment – which, she says, "brought him back to us". The experience prompted her to become an advocate, pushing for a state law that requires insurers to cover treatments including IVIG for Pans/Pandas patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Charlie's Law" &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/life-stages-populations/maternal-child-family-health-services/pandas-pans.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;passed in Illinois in 2017&lt;/a&gt; – but to this day, Drury says, it can be a struggle to get the right treatments for her son, who is now 20.

&lt;p id="af44b7fa-623b-4488-9591-61b4d7fc9135"&gt;Knee pain can be frustrating, especially when it prevents you from exercising. When recovering from a knee injury or dealing with mild knee pain, it's crucial to strengthen the muscles around the knee so that the joint has sufficient support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/physio_san_/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/physio_san_/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Sanjit Kooner&lt;/a&gt; is a physical therapist and he says he recommends isometric holds to a lot of his clients who have knee pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="af44b7fa-623b-4488-9591-61b4d7fc9135-2"&gt;"The two isometric holds [below] are designed to help reduce knee pain and build strength without aggravating symptoms," he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These exercises will be particularly helpful if you suffer from knee pain while running or lifting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These moves primarily target the quadriceps, which play a key role in patellar stability [the positioning of the kneecap]. They also engage supporting muscles in the hips and calves, depending on the variation," Krooner says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He advises that the moves are appropriate for lots of musculoskeletal issues, but it’s still best to consult a health professional before trying these moves if you have severe pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-do-sanjit-kooner-s-isometric-exercises-for-knee-pain" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-sanjit-kooner-s-isometric-exercises-for-knee-pain"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do Sanjit Kooner's isometric exercises for knee pain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="45b95bf1-2c99-4dfc-bff7-c7333abd5a96"&gt;You'll need to stand by a fixed surface, like a wall, to do these exercises.

From there, bend your knees towards the floor in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For beginners, try a shallower knee bend for reduced joint load. For a more advanced variation, deepen the knee bend to increase muscle activation and strength gains. This is suitable when pain levels are low and movement is well tolerated," he suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second position involves pressing the hamstring of one leg into a foam roller against the wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kooner recommends holding each position for 20 to 45 seconds for two to four sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aim to do these moves 3 to 5 times per week, often early in a strength session or as part of rehab," he recommends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As with any exercise, depth and duration should be adjusted for comfort, and it’s best to stop if pain worsens and seek professional guidance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-why-are-isometric-holds-so-beneficial-for-knee-pain" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-are-isometric-holds-so-beneficial-for-knee-pain"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why are isometric holds so beneficial for knee pain?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="0d7a809c-c519-435d-96f8-3e1c331f0870"&gt;"Isometric exercises involve holding a position under tension without moving the joint, which not only strengthens muscles but can also help calm down the nervous system’s sensitivity to movement in a painful area," Krooner explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means that doing an isometric hold could provide immediate knee pain relief for some people, as this sensitivity decreases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When an area is irritated, the nervous system can become more protective, sometimes interpreting normal movement as a threat. Isometric contractions provide a safe, controlled way to load the muscles and joints without rapid or excessive movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over time, this repeated, low-threat loading can desensitize the area, reduce pain perception, and restore confidence in movement," Krooner says.&lt;/p&gt;

If effective, it could help curb the opioid crisis by providing a powerful alternative. Credit: Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The discovery of a new painkiller offers relief with fewer side effects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morphine and other opioids are commonly used in medicine because of their strong ability to relieve pain. Yet, they also pose significant risks, including respiratory depression and drug dependence. To limit these dangers, Japan enforces strict rules that allow only specially authorized physicians to prescribe such medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the United States saw widespread prescribing of the opioid OxyContin, which fueled a rise in the misuse of synthetic opioids like &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;fentanyl&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid drug that is similar to morphine but is 50 to 100 times more potent. It is used to treat severe pain, such as pain from cancer or surgery, and is typically administered via injection or transdermal patch. Fentanyl can also be used recreationally, and its use has been linked to a significant increase in opioid overdose deaths in recent years. Due to its high potency, fentanyl can be dangerous even in small doses, and its use should be closely monitored by a healthcare provider.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;fentanyl&lt;/span&gt;. By 2023, deaths from opioid overdoses had exceeded 80,000, marking the escalation of a nationwide public health emergency now known as the “opioid crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A new analgesic approach&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opioids may soon face competition. Researchers at &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/kyoto-university/"&gt;Kyoto University&lt;/a&gt; have identified a new analgesic, named &lt;em&gt;ADRIANA&lt;/em&gt;, that provides pain relief through a completely different biological pathway. The drug is now moving through clinical development as part of an international research collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If successfully commercialized, ADRIANA would offer a new pain management option that does not rely on opioids, contributing significantly to the reduction of opioid use in clinical settings,” says corresponding author Masatoshi Hagiwara, a specially-appointed professor at Kyoto University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Targeting adrenoceptors for safer pain relief&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers drew their initial inspiration from compounds that imitate noradrenaline, a chemical released during life-threatening situations that activates α2A-adrenoceptors to reduce pain. While effective, these compounds carry a high risk of destabilizing cardiovascular function. By examining the relationship between noradrenaline levels and α2B-adrenoceptors, the team proposed that selectively blocking α2B-adrenoceptors could increase noradrenaline activity, stimulate α2A-adrenoceptors, and provide pain relief without triggering cardiovascular instability.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: KyotoU / Hagiwara lab&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this idea, the scientists used a specialized method called the TGFα shedding assay, which allowed them to measure the function of different α2-adrenoceptor subtypes. Through compound screening, they succeeded in identifying the world’s first selective α2B-adrenoceptor antagonist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Promising clinical results and future trials&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After success in administering the compound to mice and conducting non-clinical studies to assess its safety, physician-led clinical trials were conducted at Kyoto University Hospital. Both the Phase I trial in healthy volunteers and the Phase II trial in patients with postoperative pain following lung cancer surgery yielded highly promising results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on these outcomes, preparations are now underway for a large-scale Phase II clinical trial in the United States, in collaboration with BTB Therapeutics, Inc, a Kyoto University-originated venture company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Japan’s first non-opioid analgesic, ADRIANA has the potential not only to relieve severe pain for patients worldwide but could also play a meaningful role in addressing the opioid crisis — a pressing social issue in the United States — and thus contribute to international public health efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We aim to evaluate the analgesic effects of ADRIANA across various types of pain and ultimately make this treatment accessible to a broader population of patients suffering from chronic pain,” says Hagiwara.&lt;/p&gt;
