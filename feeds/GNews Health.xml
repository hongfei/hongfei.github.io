			&lt;p&gt;A study presented at the American Heart Association's scientific meetings has raised concerns about melatonin, one of Britain's most commonly prescribed sleep  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hiv" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73049" data-postid="180949" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;aids&lt;/a&gt;. The findings suggest that long-term users face a higher risk of heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the preliminary data demands careful scrutiny before the alarm is sounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/melatonin-15404"&gt;Melatonin&lt;/a&gt; has been prescribed in the UK for nearly two decades, with 2.5 million prescriptions issued in England &lt;a href="https://openprescribing.net/chemical/0401010AD/"&gt;last year alone&lt;/a&gt;. The drug is a synthetic version of the hormone naturally produced in the brain – the so-called "hormone of darkness" that regulates our sleep–wake cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-used-to-sleep-twice-every-night-heres-why-it-vanished"&gt;Humans Used to Sleep Twice Every Night. Here's Why It Vanished.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, it's been &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/melatonin/who-can-and-cannot-take-melatonin/"&gt;considered safe&lt;/a&gt; for treating short-term sleep problems in adults and, under specialist supervision, for children with learning disabilities or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="180949" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published only as a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4371606"&gt;brief summary&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed electronic health records of roughly 130,000 adults with sleep difficulties over five years – half of whom took melatonin and half of whom didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who took melatonin for at least a year were roughly three times more likely to be hospitalized with heart failure than non-users (19 percent of people who took melatonin versus 6.6 percent of people who did not).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term users also faced higher rates of heart failure diagnosis and death from any cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers attempted to balance their comparison by matching melatonin users with non-users across 40 factors, including age, health conditions and medications. Yet the study found only an association, not causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distinction matters. Correlation doesn't prove that melatonin caused heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The devil, as ever, lives in the missing details. Only a 300-word summary of the study exists so far, meaning crucial information – melatonin dosage, insomnia severity, lifestyle factors – remains unreported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's methodology raises questions. It relied on electronic medical records rather than direct patient follow-up or interviews, which can leave gaps in the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research drew from TriNetX Global Research Network, a large international database. But healthcare practices and record-keeping vary wildly between hospitals and nations, potentially skewing results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, melatonin requires a prescription for specific conditions. But in the US, it's sold over the counter – purchases that are often not documented in medical records. This means some people categorized as non-users may actually have been taking melatonin, muddying the comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The missing piece of the puzzle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even assuming both groups were correctly identified and matched, a key question lingers: why did one group receive melatonin while the other didn't?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps those prescribed the drug suffered more severe or disruptive sleep problems – symptoms that might reflect underlying health issues, including heart problems. If so, melatonin might simply be a marker of existing risk rather than the cause of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/clc.70107"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; in heart failure patients suggested melatonin may actually protect heart health by improving psychological wellbeing and heart function. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ehf2.12829"&gt;Other research indicated&lt;/a&gt; it could ease symptoms in people with heart failure and serve as a safe complementary therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the study exists only as an abstract, it hasn't undergone  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/science-peer-review" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73086" data-postid="180949" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;peer review&lt;/a&gt;. And information on the study's methods and results remains limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings are noteworthy and raise legitimate questions about the long-term risks of using this supplement, they're far from conclusive. Further studies are needed to determine whether prolonged melatonin use affects heart health, and if so, how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors face a familiar balancing act: weighing treatment benefits against potential risks. Poor sleep doesn't just affect the heart; it's linked to &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/sleep-disorders/sleep-and-heart-health#:%7E:text=Sleep%20disorders%20such%20as%20insomnia%2C%20apnea%2C%20narcolepsy%20and,linked%20to%20a%20higher%20risk%20of%20cardiovascular%20diseases."&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt; with metabolism, mental health and the immune system, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors typically start with &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/mental-wellbeing-tips/how-to-fall-asleep-faster-and-sleep-better/"&gt;lifestyle changes, better sleep habits&lt;/a&gt; and talk therapy. But when these fail to improve sleep quality, short-term medication may be necessary to restore healthy patterns and prevent further health complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The melatonin story isn't over. It's just beginning. Until fuller evidence emerges, panic seems premature.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269131/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

For example, in Agwu’s state of Maryland, cases are at “four to five times what they saw this time last year,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://directory.hsc.wvu.edu/Profile/88750" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Matthew Thomas" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69137e92e4b0c374cf511d14" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://directory.hsc.wvu.edu/Profile/88750" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Dr. Matthew Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at WVU Medicine Golisano Children’s in West Virginia, said spikes typically happen in cycles. “Some years you’ll see a lot of cases, like we’re seeing this year, and then it kind of fades away, where you don’t hear about it for a while,” Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With cases higher than normal, it’s important to know the signs of the virus and what to do if you (or your kids) get sick. Here’s what to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As the name suggests, symptoms include blisters on the hands, feet and mouth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hand, foot and mouth is a virus within the family of enteroviruses, explained &lt;a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/jennifer-duchon" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Jennifer Duchon" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69137e92e4b0c374cf511d14" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/jennifer-duchon" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr. Jennifer Duchon&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor in the divisions of pediatric infectious disease and newborn medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enteroviruses can present with a range of symptoms. In the case of hand, foot and mouth, “people can have symptoms like a common cold,” according to Thomas. This includes a fever, Agwu added, in addition to respiratory symptoms such as a runny nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But then a common feature is that they will have a rash, typically on the hands and feet, as well as ulcers or blisters within the mouth,” Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blisters in the mouth are generally at the back of the throat and are often really painful, according to Duchon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the hands and feet, the rash may appear as little red bumps. “Those show up a couple days after the fever,” Agwu noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes people’s hands will start to peel when the rash starts to go away, their feet will start to peel after the rash goes away,” Duchon said. “In really dramatic cases, sometimes your fingernails can fall off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Jill Lehmann Photography via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jill Lehmann Photography via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Hand, foot and mouth disease can cause blister-like bumps.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The disease spreads through respiratory droplets and fecal matter and can live on surfaces.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hand, foot and mouth disease is “super contagious,” Agwu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It spreads through respiratory droplets that go out in the air when someone coughs or sneezes, according to Thomas. It can also spread via the fluid from the blisters or via infected surfaces. So if a child who has the virus drools on toys at daycare, other kids could get sick from those toys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s also spread in stool, so particularly for our infants who are not yet potty trained, someone who’s changing diapers is often putting themselves at risk,” Thomas said. For parents or caretakers changing dirty diapers, good hand hygiene is particularly important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most children and adults recover easily at home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the virus certainly can be gruesome, and often painful, most people do recover at home with the help of symptomatic care such as fever-reducing medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no specific medications for hand, foot and mouth, and since it’s a viral illness, “no antibiotics are going to get rid of it,” Agwu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or your children do get sick, you should “try to avoid spreading it to anyone else,” Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who is sick with hand, foot and mouth should isolate from others so they don’t pass on the virus, while also hydrating and eating enough nutrients. The virus tends to last for about a week in most people, Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re having more severe symptoms, like if you’re having a lot of ulcers in your mouth, it may take up to 10 to 14 days to resolve fully,” Thomas added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people require additional care, though. If you aren’t able to hydrate, or keep your sick child hydrated, you should seek medical care, Thomas noted. The same is true if whoever is sick isn’t able to eat enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duchon added, “If you’ve had hand, foot and mouth and afterwards, or towards the end of the illness, you’re feeling really, really tired or having trouble breathing, those are things that are really serious to look for that can mean that the heart has been affected. That’s a very rare but serious complication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hand-washing is a good way to protect yourself from catching this virus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of things you can do to keep yourself from getting sick with hand, foot and mouth and other viruses that are currently circulating such as the common cold and &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/coronavirus" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="COVID-19" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69137e92e4b0c374cf511d14" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/news/topic/coronavirus" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way to prevent it is going to be always the same thing — washing hands ... if you’re touching something that’s problematic, like stool or what have you, making sure you’re doubling down on using good hand hygiene,” Agwu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re out and about, a “good alcohol-based hand sanitizer” is a fine option, too, but hand-washing with soap and water is ideal, Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also helpful to avoid touching your face as much as you can, Agwu noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden campaign-cta"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Power&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Truth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__sub-headline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join HuffPost members who keep fearless, inclusive journalism alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

			&lt;p&gt;There's fresh hope for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mysterious-form-of-vision-loss-may-brew-inside-the-gut-scientists-say"&gt;early detection&lt;/a&gt; and new treatments of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"&gt;glaucoma&lt;/a&gt;, a group of eye diseases that have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-eye-test-can-detect-glaucoma-4-years-before-current-tests"&gt;devastating effects on vision&lt;/a&gt; – and for which there is currently no cure. A new study has identified two natural molecules that play an important role in these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The molecules are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agmatine"&gt;agmatine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine"&gt;thiamine&lt;/a&gt; (also known as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="181436" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; B1), and their role in protecting against glaucoma was discovered by researchers led by a team from the University of Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists suggest that agmatine and thiamine could be used as biomarkers for earlier detection of glaucoma, allowing doctors to put preventative measures in place at an earlier stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/space-can-hurt-your-vision-and-now-we-can-predict-the-damage"&gt;Space Can Hurt Your Vision, And Now We Can Predict The Damage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In several cases, people do not find out they have glaucoma until they are older and their eye pressure is elevated," &lt;a href="https://showme.missouri.edu/2025/mizzou-researcher-discovers-natural-molecules-that-may-help-glaucoma-patients/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; ophthalmology researcher Pawan Singh, from the University of Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The molecules could also help with new treatments: boosting the levels of agmatine and thiamine in mice was shown to reduce inflammation in the retina, protect the retinal ganglion nerve cells (RGCs) that are typically damaged by glaucoma, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/can-eye-exercises-improve-your-vision-an-expert-reveals-the-truth"&gt;improve the vision&lt;/a&gt; of the animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team examined a fluid in the eye called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_humour"&gt;aqueous humor&lt;/a&gt; in 19 glaucoma patients and 10 healthy people, testing for 135 different &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"&gt;metabolites&lt;/a&gt;. Of those, agmatine and thiamine were found to be especially reduced in people with glaucoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Agmatine and thiamine could be potential immunomodulatory or neuroprotective drugs to treat or prevent neuroinflammatory damage to the retina during glaucoma," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.66.5.28"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181439" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181439" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ChemicalLevels.jpg" alt="Chemical level chart" class="wp-image-181439 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ChemicalLevels.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ChemicalLevels-600x462.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181439" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked for chemical abnormalities in the eyes of people with glaucoma. (Monu et al., &lt;em&gt;Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also tested agmatine and thiamine on stressed mouse photoreceptor cells in the lab, finding more positive results: the chemicals &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cocoa-extract-supplements-could-reduce-aging-related-chronic-inflammation"&gt;reduced inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in the cells, and protected them from dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glaucoma slowly leads to irreversible blindness, caused by damage to the nerves at the back of the eye. It's often, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/glaucoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20372839"&gt;but not always&lt;/a&gt;, linked to elevated pressure in the eye – something that current treatments focus on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those treatments can only really slow down the disease though. Agmatine and thiamine show promise in stopping the progression of nerve cell &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-eyes-can-shed-light-on-underlying-health-problems"&gt;damage in the eye&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps reverse some of the damage that's already been done. However, a lot of further study is needed before this can be used to treat humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our long-term goal is to see if doctors could one day do a simple blood test to check for these biomarkers," &lt;a href="https://showme.missouri.edu/2025/mizzou-researcher-discovers-natural-molecules-that-may-help-glaucoma-patients/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Singh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they can, hopefully they will be able to catch the disease much earlier, before vision loss occurs, so patients can receive treatment sooner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.66.5.28"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The findings suggest that ADHD involves differences in how emotional and cognitive brain circuits are physically wired during development. Although these differences are subtle, they could play a role in shaping the severity of symptoms across childhood and adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD has increasingly been conceptualized as a disorder that affects the brain’s connectivity. Many studies have focused on the brain’s outer cortical regions, such as the frontal lobes, which are involved in attention and executive function. However, less is known about how deeper brain structures, like those in the limbic system, develop in children with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The limbic system helps regulate emotion and integrates emotional signals with cognitive processes. It is also implicated in behavioral regulation, impulse control, and mood—all areas where people with ADHD often experience difficulties. Emotional dysregulation is especially common in ADHD and can affect quality of life. Given the limbic system’s role in emotion and behavior, the researchers aimed to better understand how its white matter—bundles of nerve fibers that connect brain regions—develops in youth with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longitudinal brain imaging research allows scientists to examine how brain structures change over time. By focusing on the limbic system and using more advanced imaging techniques than in past research, the authors of this study hoped to uncover developmental patterns that may help explain why some symptoms of ADHD persist or worsen during adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most research on ADHD brain development has focused on the outer regions of the brain, especially the frontal and striatal areas linked to attention and control,” said study author Michael Connaughton of the Department of Psychiatry at Trinity College Dublin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to look deeper – literally – into the limbic system, the brain’s emotional core that connects feeling, motivation, and focus. These regions have been difficult to study because of their complexity and location, but new MRI analysis techniques now let us see them with much finer detail. That opened the door to an important question: how do emotion-related brain pathways mature in ADHD as children move through adolescence?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed brain imaging data from 169 children and adolescents between the ages of 9 and 14. Among them, 72 had been diagnosed with ADHD, while 97 served as a comparison group without the disorder. Each participant underwent advanced diffusion MRI scans at three different time points spaced about 18 months apart. This approach allowed researchers to track changes in brain white matter over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A key strength of this study was that ADHD was confirmed at multiple time points, showing that participants met diagnostic criteria both early and later in development,” Connaughton noted. “This repeated confirmation is crucial for developmental research – it ensures we’re capturing stable features of ADHD rather than temporary fluctuations that can occur as children grow and symptoms change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used an advanced brain imaging technique called diffusion kurtosis imaging to examine the structure of white matter in the brain. This method tracks how water molecules move through brain tissue. In healthy white matter, which consists of tightly packed, insulated nerve fibers, water tends to move in a highly organized way. When the structure is less orderly, water movement becomes more random.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One specific measurement, called kurtosis anisotropy, captures this level of organization. Higher kurtosis anisotropy values indicate that the white matter fibers are well-organized and likely well-myelinated, meaning they are coated with a protective layer that helps electrical signals travel efficiently. Lower values suggest that the white matter may be less developed or less efficient at supporting fast communication between brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on five major white matter tracts in the limbic system, including the cingulum bundle, which connects regions involved in both cognition and emotion. They also constructed brain network models to assess how different parts of the limbic system were interconnected in each participant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to the control group, the children with ADHD showed lower kurtosis anisotropy in both the left and right cingulum bundles. These reductions were present across all three time points, suggesting that the white matter differences were not due to temporary fluctuations but instead reflected a stable, early-emerging feature of ADHD. The pattern of white matter development followed a typical trajectory over time, but those with ADHD started out at a lower baseline and did not catch up to their peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individuals with ADHD showed stable reductions in limbic system white matter microstructural organisation, specifically lower kurtosis anisotropy in the bilateral cingulum bundle, across childhood and adolescence,” Connaughton told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the overall number and efficiency of connections within the limbic system did not significantly differ between the ADHD and control groups when considered as a whole. However, when the researchers looked at symptom severity within the ADHD group, a clearer picture emerged. Children and adolescents with more severe ADHD symptoms tended to have lower network density and reduced routing efficiency in their limbic system connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What stood out most was that connectivity within the limbic system network predicted symptom severity rather than diagnosis,” Connaughton said. “This reinforces the view of ADHD as a dimensional condition, existing along a continuum rather than as a categorical divide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between limbic system connectivity and symptom severity was not explained by differences in the cingulum bundle, suggesting that both local microstructure and broader network organization may contribute to ADHD symptoms in distinct ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The differences observed in the study were relatively small in size, but they were consistent. “They aren’t large enough for clinical prediction, but in neurodevelopment, small differences across interconnected systems can still influence symptom severity and presentation,” Connaughton explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, the findings indicate that ADHD involves early, stable disruptions in limbic white matter development, particularly within the cingulum, and that reductions in white matter interconnecting limbic regions become more pronounced in individuals with more severe ADHD symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than pointing to a single brain abnormality, the results support the idea that ADHD involves distributed, small-scale differences across multiple systems. These differences may arise early in life and contribute to how symptoms unfold over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results don’t point to a single ‘ADHD biomarker,'” Connaughton said. “They reflect group- level trends, not diagnostic markers, and should be seen as part of a larger developmental picture that combines genetics, environment, and experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study offers important insights but also has some limitations. One issue is that the limbic system does not have a universally agreed-upon anatomical definition. Different studies may include or exclude certain regions, which can complicate comparisons across research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The age range studied was also relatively narrow, focusing on the transition from late childhood into early adolescence. Some individuals with ADHD may show delayed brain development that catches up later in adolescence or early adulthood. Extending the research to cover a wider age range could help clarify whether the differences observed here persist, worsen, or diminish over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We aim to track these developmental changes across the lifespan, extending our work into late adolescence and early adulthood when brain connectivity continues to evolve,” Connaughton explained. “By following individuals over longer periods and integrating imaging with genetic and behavioural data, we can begin to see how early brain differences unfold, stabilize, or adapt over time. The goal is to build a lifespan model of ADHD that helps both patients and clinicians understand why symptoms persist or remit across life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2025.09.022" target="_blank"&gt;Limbic System White Matter in Children and Adolescents with ADHD: A Longitudinal Diffusion MRI Analysis&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Michael Connaughton, Alexander Leemans, Timothy J.

But &lt;a rel="nofollow" data-affiliate="true" target="_blank" href="http://redirect.viglink.com?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-025-63475-2&amp;amp;articleId=b2863711&amp;amp;key=5b1a6400a3c0d931ed2037885e1a27a3"&gt;new research from the University of Sydney&lt;/a&gt; suggests a certain type of &lt;a href="/topic/exercise"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; could be more powerful in preventing these conditions than previously thought: vigorous-intensity activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new data found vigorous-intensity activity to be six times more effective at lowering your risk of cardiovascular disease than moderate-intensity activities like brisk walking, lead author Professor Emmanuel Stamatakis tells me. In other words, for every one minute of vigorous-intensity activity you do, you would need to do six minutes of a moderate-intensity activity to have the same impact on heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For diabetes, it’s nine times more effective, and for all-cause mortality and cancer it’s a little bit lower,” Professor Stamatakis adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term “vigorous-intensity activity” is relative – depending on factors such as your age and fitness level, it could mean anything from a swim or cycle to a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workout. The telltale signs are; your heart is beating fast; you are breathing hard to the point you can’t speak in full sentences; you can’t maintain this intensity for more than a few minutes at a time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can reach this intensity a few times per week, you can reduce your risk of chronic illness, the University of Sydney’s study suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-lq6hxg-0 kcbSyT"&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vigorous-intensity physical activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘The signs of vigorous intensity will be very clear. For a non-athlete aged 30 and up who doesn’t do much exercise, they shouldn’t be able to maintain this intensity for more than two to three minutes without a break. It will be a significant effort, you will be getting out of breath and your heart will be pounding. You should be able to talk, but only say a few words at a time.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderate-intensity physical activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘You will feel slightly out of breath – you can talk and hold a discussion, but you can’t sing comfortably because your respiratory system is quite engaged. There is a certain level of exertion, but you can sustain this for many minutes or even hours.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light physical activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Light physical activity is any very low-intensity activity where you are moving but your heart rate is barely raised, such as a slow walk.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the science says &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organisation recommends adults do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity like brisk walking, 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity like faster running or HIIT, or an equivalent of both. These physical activity guidelines have been widely adopted by the likes of the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/physical-activity-guidelines-for-adults-aged-19-to-64/"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this new research, published in the Nature journal, challenges the implicit 2:1 benefit ratio of the two intensities, suggesting you might need less vigorous-intensity activity or more moderate-intensity activity than previously thought to achieve the same health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We make a lot of fuss about the intensity of physical activity in our research because, firstly, different intensities have different health effects, and secondly, the higher the intensity, the higher the health value usually is,” says Professor Stamatakis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His latest study used wearable data from 73,485 UK participants to assess the health impacts of light, moderate and vigorous activity against a selection of specific health outcomes; cardiovascular mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, type 2 diabetes and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-lq6hxg-0 kcbSyT"&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health outcome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amount of vigorous-intensity activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Median equivalence in minutes to see the same response from moderate-intensity activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Median equivalence in minutes to see the same response from light activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes incidence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 minute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;9.4 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;94 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular mortality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 minute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;7.8 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;72.5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major adverse cardiovascular events&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 minute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.4 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;86.1 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;All-cause mortality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 minute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.1 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;52.7 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity related cancer mortality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 minute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;156.2 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity related cancer incidence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 minute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.6 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.1 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obvious conclusion here is that a time-efficient exercise routine should hinge on vigorous-intensity activity. If you prefer moderate-intensity activities like brisk walking, you can use these to obtain similar health benefits, but the time commitment required for the same gains will be considerably greater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, no amount of light activity, like a slow walk, can replicate “some of the core physiological responses from vigorous-intensity activity”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it comes to light activity, some movement is better than none,” Professor Stamatakis explains. “Moving around instead of sitting down is good for metabolic disease and energy expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But when it comes to functional capacity, and cardiorespiratory fitness in particular, you need intensity to challenge your physiology. Vigorous-intensity activity will force the heart to strengthen its muscle, improving its capacity to pump blood. Very few of these things happen with light intensity activity, even in large amounts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/exercise-intensity-heart-health-b2856019.html"&gt;The thing most people get wrong when exercising – and why it’s costing them results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 lnqVrP"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/03/8/07/iStock-1097320204.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/03/8/07/iStock-1097320204.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/03/8/07/iStock-1097320204.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Walking or running uphill, or up stairs, can be a way to increase the intensity of an activity" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-314624"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Walking or running uphill, or up stairs, can be a way to increase the intensity of an activity&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to exercise for maximum health benefits, based on this research &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Compared to people who don’t do any vigorous-intensity activity as part of their day-to-day routines, introducing anything – even four to five minutes per day – seems to have some effect long term,” says Professor Stamatakis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This relates to another paper he co-authored earlier this year. The research found that five to 10 short daily bursts of vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity (or VILPA), such as climbing the stairs or carrying heavy shopping, can significantly lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer and premature death in less active populations. These bouts of VILPA can be accrued through 60-second bursts of physically challenging activities during the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to achieving lifelong benefits is to make these active behaviours into a habit, Professor Stamatakis asserts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re not talking about doing it once a week or whenever you remember, we’re talking about a daily behaviour,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those currently living a sedentary lifestyle are the most likely to see significant benefits from introducing short bouts of vigorous-intensity activities into each day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If someone does no vigorous-intensity activity, very little moderate-intensity activity – let’s say 15 minutes or less – and a few hours of light activity per day, that’s a very sedentary individual,” Professor Stamatakis says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Typically, they will do under 5,000 or 6,000 steps per day. A very sedentary non-bedridden person – someone who does no planned physical activity, just essential movements like going to the car to drive to work, going to the supermarket for food or going to the bathroom – will accumulate about 4,000 steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For such an individual, if they aim to incorporate seven short bursts of vigorous activity per day, or if you go by this study the equivalent is 63 minutes of moderate activity, they will lower their risk of health outcomes like cardiovascular diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/negative-health-effects-of-sitting-down-b2842653.html"&gt;From back pain to heart health – Experts reveal how to counter the negative effects of too much sitting down&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bAxvyM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/02/17/55/iStock-1912105812.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/02/17/55/iStock-1912105812.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/02/17/55/iStock-1912105812.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The most important factor in securing long-term health benefits is finding a type of exercise you can stick with" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-314625"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;The most important factor in securing long-term health benefits is finding a type of exercise you can stick with&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dealer’s choice, and why vigorous-intensity activity is not for everyone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study is not to impose vigorous-intensity activity across all populations. Rather, it aims to provide people with more strings to their bow when creating an effective and sustainable exercise routine for fending off chronic illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are short on time, vigorous-intensity physical activity can help you maximise exercise efficiency, particularly if you use short bursts of challenging lifestyle activities like climbing the stairs and carrying heavy shopping. These acts can also familiarise you with the feeling of a workout, paving the way for more formal exercise later down the line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this approach won’t work for everyone. Pushing people into a type of exercise they don’t enjoy can leave a “bad taste in their mouth”, souring their relationship with movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The higher the intensity, the more discomfort comes with it,” says Professor Stamatakis. “We know this discomfort is a reason why some people quit exercise – because they don’t enjoy it. This is especially true in the population we’re interested in, which is physically inactive people.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this is the case, moderate-intensity activity is a good alternative. You will have to devote more time to it – even more than previously thought, this latest study suggests – but it could be a more sustainable and enjoyable approach for certain people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If someone cannot do vigorous activity, or they can’t integrate it into their day-to-day routine for whatever reason, what is the point of prescribing and advocating vigorous intensity?” Professor Stamatakis asks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It could be that a very sedentary 60- or 70-year-old gentleman may enjoy going to the park with their grandchildren or going for a slow walk with a friend and chatting – that’s absolutely fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have to be considerate and respectful towards people’s preferences; you have to acknowledge their circumstances and, considering everything, support them in the best possible way to integrate activity into their days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The point here is to give people as many options as possible, hoping that one of them will be the option they can stick with. It’s all about establishing habits – not doing things once a week or once a month.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/polyphenols-benefits-and-anti-ageing-effects-b2831125.html"&gt;Experts say including more of this in your diet can help you live a longer, healthier life - and it’s not protein or fibre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 10:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQTWtmbDBJX3NYcUFjLUdCbzZjZ0JnRkgxMy1kTHI4b0dPc29wYVYzS3FadEtjX2hwMGJHemJoU0FsNldaRl9RcmNvbTEzVGczYjhFY2R6VWNmaUVBeHRvRU5iaHNZSEJmZ3VkOFhqb2pNalp0Vkdoc0h6aE9GUlJ6Ym5DRmpDZ0w5aGkwa3pfaXlkay0zWTBjTHFnMC02OVg3TGJvenQxbHBmc0E</guid></item><item><title>北卡罗来纳州居民在匹兹堡停留，为肺癌患者辩护- TribLIVE.com</title><link>https://triblive.com/news/health-now/north-carolina-resident-stops-in-pittsburgh-advocating-for-lung-cancer-patients/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;

However, it is important to note that &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557876/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;too much vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; can also be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; looks at three recent studies to examine the possible role vitamin D may have in supporting health and boosting longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent literature review of 50 studies and more than 1 million participants suggest that vitamin D may help decrease the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/155598" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; and also improve survival for the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Published in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/8/1351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in April 2025, the review found that higher serum vitamin D levels were associated with &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/vitamin-d-may-decrease-risk-colorectal-cancer-benefits-improve-survival" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;a reduced risk of colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, among those with colorectal cancer, higher vitamin D levels were linked to improved survival and reduced mortality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the review suggested that vitamin D helps the immune system and may assist with decreasing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D may also possess specific anticancer properties, such as supporting programmed cell death and stopping uncontrolled cell growth. The authors added that vitamin D may be a useful adjunctive option alongside other cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, despite these promosing associations, the researchers noted that more research is still necessary, particularly large-scale, randomized clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some research noted that both dietary vitamin D and vitamin D supplements have beneficial effects on colorectal cancer, other studies did not find a significant relationship between vitamin D and colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies highlighted that results may differ due to factors such as &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323586" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;body mass index (BMI)&lt;/a&gt;, sex, and nutritional status. It may be helpful for further research to explore components like how people’s genetics, lifestyle choices, and use of other treatments play a role in vitamin D’s effects on cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/wael-harb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Wael Harb&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified hematologist and medical oncologist at MemorialCare Cancer Institute at Orange Coast and Saddleback Medical Centers in Orange County, CA, who was not involved in the study, commented to &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For patients with [colorectal cancer], ensuring adequate vitamin D levels may help support immune surveillance and potentially improve outcomes when used alongside standard therapies.

Telomere length shortens with age, and telomere shortening is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8533433/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;associated&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/common-elderly-health-issues" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;age-related diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were randomized, with half receiving 2,000 IU, or 50 mcg, of vitamin D daily, and the remaining receiving a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The findings indicated that in those receiving vitamin D3, telomere shortening in &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Cancer Institute " rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/leukocyte" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;leukocytes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, a type of white blood cells, over the study period was significantly less compared with the placebo. The authors estimated this effect to be equivalent to about a 3-year reduction in &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/chronological-aging" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;biological aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis suggested that the effect of vitamin D was more evident in participants who did not have &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323551" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, those not taking &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/cholesterol-medications" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;cholesterol-lowering medications&lt;/a&gt;, and in participants of different ethnicities. Omega-3 fatty acids supplementation appeared to have no significant impact on telomere length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalofficesofmanhattan.com/our-team/dr-yoshua-quinones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Yoshua Quinones&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified internist with Medical Offices of Manhattan and contributor to LabFinder, who was not involved in the study, explained that&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we know already, vitamin D supports bone, immune system and reduces inflammation, but this study is linked directly with telomere preservation which ties into aging and disease prevention. This [study] gives more of a general idea that vitamin D3 could do more than just helping your bones but actually slowing down the cellular age, impressive!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers acknowledge that the analysis was a post-hoc examination of the VITAL trial, which was not originally designed to look at the effects of supplements on leukocyte telomere length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, most participants were white and older adults, so it may not be possible to generalize the findings to other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TARGET-D trial involved 630 participants, most of which were males with an average age of 63, who enrolled within a month of having a &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/signs-of-a-heart-attack" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers randomly selected the control group and who would receive targeted vitamin D3 treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At enrollment, 87% of participants had low vitamin D levels and the average vitamin D level was 27 nanograms/milliliter (ng/ml).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tailored vitamin D3 supplementation by measuring blood vitamin D levels and adjusting the dose so that individuals reached a target serum level of approximately 40 ng/ml.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers monitored &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/normal-vitamin-d-levels" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;vitamin D3 levels&lt;/a&gt; throughout the trial and would adjust doses to maintain the target level. They also kept track of major &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/cardiovascular-system" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;cardiovascular&lt;/a&gt; events throughout the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there was no significant difference between groups in overall cardiac events, the rate of follow-up heart attacks was 3.8% in the vitamin D3 treatment group compared to 7.9% in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall, while the results suggest that targeted vitamin D3 supplementation may not reduce all major cardiac outcomes, it did cut the risk of repeat heart attacks by more than half.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center, who was not involved in this study, explained that while past research has linked higher blood levels of vitamin D with lower heart disease rates, “it mostly appears that the relationship between vitamin D3 and heart health is that of correlation rather than that of causation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that vitamin D3 may still offer some cardiovascular benefits, such as “decreasing inflammation and lowering blood pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he cautioned that the evidence remains mixed. He added that if larger studies confirm the recent finding that targeted vitamin D3 treatment could reduce the risk of recurrent heart attacks, “it would be quite significant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 06:55:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQb2NseG9iU193alpqMi1ETld6eXpzYngteGVqNmJMNTJwb1hwOXlVQVZzRU54ZEN2ZDJjWW4zWFA1SGtUSEZ0WkFRSjVIOWZtSVhJYXI3VGRvcW9KTUt2U1RNcDFmdzdhelFhcVRpYkZTME9tRWp2SjRFTjdLUzFqalpfYWt6dGhqQkJnMXhGQkZaTEl3bFhZRllZd0owaEEzNVdhZDJWREJQRU0</guid></item><item><title>在果冻卷麻疹集群中发现的新病例-布里斯班时报</title><link>https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/new-case-identified-in-jelly-roll-measles-cluster-20251116-p5nfs6.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="Hy4HP z5wPE" data-testid="body-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fourth person has been added to a measles cluster emerging from an October concert at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday evening three people who attended American rapper Jelly Roll’s October 24 concert at the Boondall venue tested positive for measles, more than a week since being exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Queensland Health added a fourth confirmed case on Sunday morning, who had been unknowingly infectious for about a week across locations in suburbs in and around Logan, including Mustang Brothers Football Club, in Chambers Flat, and Logan Hospital’s emergency department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="_72JXS _0SAJQ mSNnk Wnq-J" data-testid="image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="qTXWa"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="_5nQzY"&gt;Logan Hospital (pictured) has been added to the list of potential measles exposure sites following a concert in late October.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite class="Zo2UY"&gt;&lt;span class="ALMCC"&gt;Credit: &lt;/span&gt;Dan Peled&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Queensland Health &lt;a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/brisbane-news-live-two-girls-reported-missing-in-past-few-days-20251112-p5nesm.html?post=p59ip4#p59ip4"&gt;released an initial public health alert on Wednesday night&lt;/a&gt; warning people who attended the October concert to watch for symptoms for up to three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="Hy4HP z5wPE" data-testid="body-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include fever, lethargy, runny nose, moist cough and red eyes.

&lt;p&gt;285 pounds. Forty-three years old. Summer 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Have you thought about GLPs?” my primary care physician asked as she listened to my heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I laughed nervously. “No, but I am now.” Humor has always been my shield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She didn’t flinch. “Your BMI is over 40. You’re at risk for all sorts of health conditions. Why don’t you look into our weight-loss program?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My labs were fine. But that didn’t matter. My body size alone was enough to warrant a prescription. I left feeling ashamed, reminded once again that medicine sees fatness as a disease in itself — regardless of actual health indicators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1995, I was 14 years old and weighed 367 pounds when an endocrinologist bluntly told my mother that I would “likely be bedridden by 20.” He described my legs as “enormous” and referred me to bariatric surgery. Soon after, I underwent a stomach stapling procedure that left an eight-inch scar down my chest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, pediatric weight loss surgery was &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10733812/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7974834" data-affiliate="true"&gt;quite rare&lt;/a&gt;. But to my doctors, my fat body made it acceptable — even necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The procedure turned eating into a cycle of pain and vomiting. Food lodged in the tiny passage created by the staples left me doubled over until I threw it back up. I became, in effect, a medically induced bulimic — praised, nonetheless, for my weight-loss “success.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within a year, I had lost nearly 100 pounds. Friends, family and even acquaintances congratulated me. No one saw the violence done to my body or the damage it did to my relationship with food. They didn’t know the surgery left me dependent on &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/rossyoder/best-ice-cream-brands"&gt;ice cream&lt;/a&gt;, crackers and mashed potatoes because I could easily chew that stuff down to a pureed consistency to avoid the pain that followed whenever food got stuck in my staples. After the surgery, and even still today, I can’t tolerate most fruit — too acidic — nor many vegetables — too fibrous. Stomach stapling didn’t make me “healthier;” it only made me thinner.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That surgery didn’t even “cure” me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than two decades later, in 2017, weighing nearly 390 pounds, I went under the knife again, this time for a sleeve gastrectomy. By then, I had surrendered to the &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-states-weight-loss-market-084700368.html" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7974834" data-affiliate="true"&gt;diet industrial complex, a multibillion-dollar ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; built around the idea that fat bodies are inherently flawed. The pressure was relentless — to fix, shrink and manage a body that medicine had always treated as a problem to solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the scrutiny wasn’t limited to exam rooms. In restaurants, on airplanes, at conferences, strangers felt entitled to comment on my body. I’ve been mocked for eating a donut, told loudly in a food court that I was “killing myself,” and subjected to humiliating requests to be reseated on flights. I’ve even overheard cruel remarks in a language people assumed I didn’t understand. Those moments left wounds far deeper than any heat rash or bruise from too-small chairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Society’s obsession with fatness extends well beyond personal interactions. Fat people are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9125650/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7974834" data-affiliate="true"&gt;consistently portrayed in the media&lt;/a&gt; as lazy, undisciplined or morally flawed. &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/oby.2001.108" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7974834" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Research has documented&lt;/a&gt; how these stereotypes influence health care practices and workplace discrimination. This cultural narrative seeps into medicine, where clinicians — even those with good intentions — can unconsciously perpetuate stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, at 44, I’m on Wegovy. Reluctantly. When I started, I told my doctor my goal weight was 250 pounds — a number that, at 5’10”, felt right to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I weigh 235, down 50 pounds in eight months. My doctor tells me to stay on it. And I’m not sure why I’m listening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially approved to treat Type 2 diabetes, GLP-1 medications like Wegovy are now viewed as a &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/Wegovy-A-Breakthrough-in-Weight-Loss.aspx" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7974834" data-affiliate="true"&gt;breakthrough&lt;/a&gt; for weight loss, but for me, they feel like another chapter in the same story: doctors offering interventions driven less by my actual health and more by the fear and stigma that surround fatness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do I take it? Because sometimes it feels easier to live with the physical and emotional side effects of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780080970868640205" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7974834" data-affiliate="true"&gt;medicalization&lt;/a&gt; than with the relentless judgment of others — and, most troubling of all for me, with my own internalized fatphobia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the truth: Fat patients aren’t blank slates waiting for salvation. We know the statistics, the risks, the medical language. What we also know — often more than our doctors — is the crushing weight of fatphobia disguised as medical concern.&lt;/p&gt;

The main culprits were plastics commonly used in everyday tableware, like polystyrene and PVC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Men who used disposable plastic dishes more often had higher levels of these microscopic particles in their samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To better understand the impact, scientists also studied mice exposed to very small plastic particles, the same type found in people. The results were worrying: The mice showed reduced sperm count and movement, and their testicular tissue displayed signs of stress and cell damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These effects were linked to a specific biological chain reaction that triggered cell "self-destruction" and tissue loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the study doesn't mean everyone who eats from plastic plates is in immediate danger, it adds to growing evidence that plastic pollution isn't just an environmental issue; it's a human one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If tiny plastic fragments can make their way into the body and potentially disrupt reproduction, that raises real concerns for communities already facing fertility challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This finding highlights how everyday choices, like reaching for a plastic fork or microwave-safe container, can have unseen health impacts over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What can we do about it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The good news is that reducing exposure is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Choosing glass, metal, or ceramic tableware instead of single-use plastic is a &lt;a href="http://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:simple start;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;simple start&lt;/a&gt;.

Let's begin. I'm Dr Evan, board certified cardiologist. Number one, I would never smoke or be around anyone who smokes. Dozens of known carcinogens, plus increasing your risk of stroke, heart attacks, vascular disease, even aortic aneurysms, and high blood pressure.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sharing a list of things to avoid, he added, “Number two, no alcohol, or at least stick to less than a few drinks a week. They're cancer-causing. They raise blood pressure. The alcohol industry and its surrogates lie to us. Number three, fast food. Don't open the door. Never walk inside. Toxic, dense calories that poisoned millions. Number four, all drugs and stimulants. I'm including marijuana here. And I'd also include limiting those ADHD meds to the lowest possible doses.”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/16/original/AI_1763260454561.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Make these small changes that can add up to a healthier, happier you.

(Made using ChatGPT)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do any exercise, check your blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Levine also advised engaging in regular exercise, aiming for at least 7,000 steps daily, and monitoring key health metrics, such as blood pressure and cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He went on to share what you should ideally be doing for a long life, and said, “Number five, do any exercise. That includes even walking. &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/is-walking-a-good-idea-what-walking-for-30-minutes-every-day-can-do-to-your-health-101728132003995.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Walking is great."&gt;Walking is great.&lt;/a&gt; At least 7,000 steps a day. Pretty easy stuff. Number six, check your blood pressure with a goal of 120 over 80 or less. Number seven, check your cholesterol and treat if that LDL is above 190 with a statin. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Otherwise, with diet and exercise, those coronary artery calcium scans in young patients with heart attacks are often normal, and these tests have limited benefit in this age group.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Ditch stress and toxic people&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cardiologist also highlighted the importance of stress reduction by avoiding toxic individuals and establishing consistent, healthy sleep habits, which lay a foundation for longevity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He concluded: “Number eight, no sodas or toxic sugar drinks... number nine,&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-explains-if-exercise-can-help-remove-or-prevent-heart-blockage-reduce-stress-lower-blood-pressure-high-bp-101754387406907.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="reduce stress"&gt; reduce stress &lt;/a&gt;and people that cause stress.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Metabolism does more than affect weight—it's tied to energy, stress, sleep and gut health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stress, sleep, gut health and insulin sensitivity all influence how your body burns energy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein, strength training and regular meals help support a healthy, efficient metabolism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you're feeling sluggish or struggling to maintain your weight, it’s tempting to blame a “slow” metabolism. But metabolism isn’t a simple on-off switch you can flip with a new workout or diet trend. While what you eat and how much you move are important, your metabolism is far more nuanced. It’s actually a complex system—the sum of all the chemical reactions in your body that convert food into energy to power everything from your heartbeat to your thoughts to your daily movement.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While genetics, age and diet do influence how efficiently your metabolism works, many everyday habits also play a role.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; According to dietitians, these often-overlooked factors can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7937672/how-to-calculate-your-metabolism/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;impact how your body burns energy&lt;/a&gt;. The good news?

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Stress isn’t just a mood disruptor—it can also have a big impact on your metabolism. When stress becomes chronic, your body produces &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-know-high-cortisol-levels-11762693" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;elevated levels of the hormone cortisol&lt;/a&gt;. In short bursts, cortisol helps your body respond to immediate challenges ("fight or flight" situations).

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While you can't control factors your genetics or stop the clock, you can adopt &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;habits that support your body&lt;/a&gt;'s metabolism. Here are some actionable tips that are more well-known and equally as important to prioritize:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Protein:&lt;/strong&gt; Including an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290496/this-is-how-much-protein-you-need-to-eat-every-day/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;adequate amount of protein&lt;/a&gt; with every meal and snack is a powerful way to support your metabolism. Your body uses energy to digest and process food, a phenomenon known as the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF). "Protein increases TEF the most, so you burn more calories when you eat protein compared to carbs and fat," explains &lt;a href="https://www.maritaradloff.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Marita Radloff, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Aim for at least 20-30 grams of protein at meals and 10-15 grams of protein for snacks to support your metabolism and stay full."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build More Muscle: &lt;/strong&gt;Strength training helps &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-maintain-muscle-mass-while-losing-weight-8706542" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;preserve lean muscle mass&lt;/a&gt;, which burns more calories at rest than fat tissue. Incorporating &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290619/trying-to-lose-weight-heres-why-strength-training-is-as-important-as-cardio/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;resistance training&lt;/a&gt;—such as lifting weights or using resistance bands—even just two times per week, can support a more active metabolism over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat Regular Meals and Snacks: &lt;/strong&gt;Skipping meals can affect your metabolism and how your body regulates blood sugar. One study found that skipping lunch for two days in a row led to a higher blood sugar spike after dinner compared to days when lunch was eaten. Interestingly, skipping breakfast or dinner didn’t have the same effect on blood sugar at the next meal.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While occasional meal shifts happen, eating regular meals and snacks can help maintain consistent energy and metabolic balance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The “silent multitaskers” of the body perform vital, behind-the-scenes work: filtering waste, balancing fluids and salts, producing hormones, and keeping our body chemistry in harmony. And because they work so tirelessly, it’s only natural that without proper maintenance, they’d fall into damage. Now, kidney damage is tricky: it often progresses without obvious warning signs, and by the time overt symptoms appear, substantial injury may already have occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if there’s a way to reverse that damage?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seems like scientists have finally found one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Don’t Ignore Silent Kidney Damage: How to Detect Issues Before It’s Too Late | Dr Sanjeev Bagai&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can kidney damage be reversed?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a landmark study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2025.10.006" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, scientists at the University of Utah Health revealed that they could fully reverse acute kidney injury (AKI) in mice by blocking harmful ceramide molecules. These ceramides, a type of fat, damage the mitochondria — the “power plants” — of kidney cells, triggering the rapid-onset of kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury is a dangerous condition often caused by severe stress on the body, such as sepsis or major surgery, and is common in intensive care units. What makes AKI especially alarming is that it can increase the risk of long-term, chronic kidney disease, for which there are very limited treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the research reveal?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Scott Summers, PhD, found that when ceramide production was genetically altered, their genetically modified “super mice” did not develop AKI — even under extreme conditions that normally damage the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s encouraging is that the researchers also tested a drug candidate developed by Centaurus Therapeutics (a company co-founded by Summers) that mimics this genetic effect. Mice pre-treated with the drug maintained normal kidney function, stayed active, and showed healthy kidney structure under the microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under closer examination, the team discovered how ceramides wreak havoc: they impair the mitochondria in kidney cells. Damaged mitochondria lose their shape and efficiency, reducing cellular energy production — a key factor in injury. But when ceramide levels were reduced, the mitochondria remained intact and worked properly, even under stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why does this matter?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, this is the first time researchers have reversed acute kidney damage in this way by targeting metabolism rather than symptoms. The fact that mitochondrial structure was preserved is especially promising because mitochondrial health is central not just to kidney cells but many other tissues, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, ceramide levels also rose quickly in human AKI patients’ urine in earlier studies, suggesting the mechanism may be relevant in people as well. If urinary ceramide becomes a reliable biomarker, it might help clinicians identify patients at risk, for example, before they undergo heart surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s next?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, this research surely is promising enough for a possible future where kidney damage can be reversed. However, despite the excitement, experts caution that results in mice don’t always translate to humans. The drug used is still preclinical, meaning it hasn’t yet been tested in human trials. Additionally, safety is a major concern. Even if ceramide-lowering works in people, long-term effects, drug metabolism, and side effects need careful evaluation. The researchers themselves acknowledge this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another challenge is the timing — in the mouse study, the drug was given before injury.

It controls cell growth in the body, reduces inflammation, and strengthens immunity. According to research, those who have the right amount of Vitamin D levels have a reduced risk of colorectal, breast, and sometimes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/prostate-cancer" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="prostate cancer"&gt;prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The oncologist notes that vitamin D supplements are not as effective as sunlight-derived vitamin D. While supplements cannot fully prevent cancer, research suggests they may help reduce the risk of death from the disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/15/original/itamin_d_graphic_1763221442665.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="The oncologist suggests these ways to maintain your vitamin D levels.(Image generated via ChatGPT)" title="The oncologist suggests these ways to maintain your vitamin D levels.(Image generated via ChatGPT)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;The oncologist suggests these ways to maintain your vitamin D levels.(Image generated via ChatGPT)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to get enough vitamin D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;To help meet your recommended vitamin D levels, Dr De suggests getting at least 15 to 20 minutes of sunlight each day - however, don’t forget your sunscreen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; He adds, “Foods like fish (such as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/doctor-shares-why-you-should-include-fatty-fishes-like-salmon-in-your-diet-boosts-heart-health-reduces-inflammation-101762952360549.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="salmon"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt;), eggs, and fortified milk should also be consumed. And if Vitamin D is low in a blood test, one should discuss supplements with a doctor. Keeping your Vitamin D levels between 30 to 50 nanograms per ml is ideal.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the oncologist emphasises that vitamin D is not a magical shield, but it is certainly a powerful part of a healthy lifestyle. So the next time you step out into the sun, think of it as your natural dose of cancer protection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Dr Berg emphasises that supporting mitochondrial health becomes a key strategy in reducing cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When mitochondria are damaged or dysfunctional, cells may revert to abnormal energy pathways, oxidative stress increases, and the environment becomes more favourable for malignant transformation.

DNA mutations caused by factors like carcinogens, viruses, chronic inflammation, or inherited genes disrupt the balance of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. These changes allow cells to multiply uncontrollably, evade death, and sometimes hide from the immune system. Cancer cells also alter their metabolism, relying on less efficient energy processes to fuel rapid growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tumors can form and, in some cases, spread to other parts of the body (metastasis). Overall, cancer reflects not just rogue cells but a body environment that enables their survival and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5 quick tips to avoid getting cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;An early point in the video: “Avoid all refined foods.” That means sugar, refined flour, processed snacks, and other “empty‑calorie” items. Why does this matter? Refined foods tend to spike insulin, promote inflammation, feed abnormal cell growth, and put stress on metabolic regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you reduce the intake of these foods, you lessen insulin spikes, reduce the oxidative burden on mitochondria, and create an internal milieu less hospitable to cancerous changes. This strategy aligns with broader research showing that diets high in highly processed carbs correlate with higher cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support mitochondria via diet and fasting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond what you eliminate, Dr Berg advocates for what you do to support mitochondrial health. Two major diet‑strategies he mentions: adopting a low‑carbohydrate (or moderately low‑carb) diet, and using intermittent fasting (or time‑restricted eating). The idea is to reduce metabolic strain, allow cells to repair, reduce oxidative stress, and give mitochondria a chance to “reset”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you go low‑carb, fewer glucose surges occur; insulin demand drops. When you fast or restrict your eating window, your body shifts toward fat/ketone metabolism for periods, which may enhance mitochondrial resilience, trigger autophagy (cellular clean‑up) and reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antioxidants and phytochemicals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key theme is the role of antioxidants and phytochemicals (plant compounds) in protecting cells and mitochondria from damage. Foods rich in colourful vegetables, berries, herbs and certain spices help neutralise free radicals and lower oxidative stress. Herbs like turmeric, rosemary, green tea extract, and others may support mitochondria and immunologic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By making an “anti‑cancer diet” that is heavy on whole, unprocessed plant foods, you provide the raw materials your body needs to defend itself. You improve detox pathways (liver, lymphatic), bolster immune surveillance, and reduce the accumulation of damaged cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lifestyle factors: Movement, sunlight, fresh air, detoxification&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer prevention isn’t just about what you eat. The video touches on lifestyle factors: daily physical movement, exposure to natural sunlight (for vitamin D), fresh air, and even cold exposure or “stressors” that stimulate mitochondrial adaptation. These practices make the body more robust, optimise circulation, support tissue oxygenation, and enhance immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Movement means muscle‑pump, lymph flush, better mitochondrial density. Sunlight signals circadian processes and vitamin D synthesis (important for immune health). Fresh air and decent ventilation reduce indoor pollutants and support respiratory‑detoxification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Minimising iron overload and other hidden risks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more nuanced point: he mentions avoiding excess iron accumulation. While iron is essential, in excess it can catalyse free‑radical reactions (Fenton chemistry) and thereby damage mitochondria and DNA. So ensuring you’re not overloaded with iron (especially if you’re not using it) can be protective. It signals that cancer‑prevention isn't only “big”, obvious things but also hidden biochemical stressors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other hidden risks include environmental toxins, poor sleep, chronic stress, and impaired gut health all of which may impair mitochondrial and immune health long‑term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This content is for informational and educational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

This strategy aligns with broader research showing that diets high in highly processed carbs correlate with higher cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support mitochondria via diet and fasting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond what you eliminate, Dr Berg advocates for what you do to support mitochondrial health. Two major diet‑strategies he mentions: adopting a low‑carbohydrate (or moderately low‑carb) diet, and using intermittent fasting (or time‑restricted eating). The idea is to reduce metabolic strain, allow cells to repair, reduce oxidative stress, and give mitochondria a chance to “reset”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you go low‑carb, fewer glucose surges occur; insulin demand drops. When you fast or restrict your eating window, your body shifts toward fat/ketone metabolism for periods, which may enhance mitochondrial resilience, trigger autophagy (cellular clean‑up) and reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antioxidants and phytochemicals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key theme is the role of antioxidants and phytochemicals (plant compounds) in protecting cells and mitochondria from damage. Foods rich in colourful vegetables, berries, herbs and certain spices help neutralise free radicals and lower oxidative stress. Herbs like turmeric, rosemary, green tea extract, and others may support mitochondria and immunologic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By making an “anti‑cancer diet” that is heavy on whole, unprocessed plant foods, you provide the raw materials your body needs to defend itself. You improve detox pathways (liver, lymphatic), bolster immune surveillance, and reduce the accumulation of damaged cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lifestyle factors: Movement, sunlight, fresh air, detoxification&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer prevention isn’t just about what you eat. The video touches on lifestyle factors: daily physical movement, exposure to natural sunlight (for vitamin D), fresh air, and even cold exposure or “stressors” that stimulate mitochondrial adaptation. These practices make the body more robust, optimise circulation, support tissue oxygenation, and enhance immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Movement means muscle‑pump, lymph flush, better mitochondrial density. Sunlight signals circadian processes and vitamin D synthesis (important for immune health). Fresh air and decent ventilation reduce indoor pollutants and support respiratory‑detoxification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Minimising iron overload and other hidden risks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more nuanced point: he mentions avoiding excess iron accumulation. While iron is essential, in excess it can catalyse free‑radical reactions (Fenton chemistry) and thereby damage mitochondria and DNA. So ensuring you’re not overloaded with iron (especially if you’re not using it) can be protective. It signals that cancer‑prevention isn't only “big”, obvious things but also hidden biochemical stressors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other hidden risks include environmental toxins, poor sleep, chronic stress, and impaired gut health all of which may impair mitochondrial and immune health long‑term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This content is for informational and educational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

			&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists have targeted the sticky protein clumps that amass in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's brains&lt;/a&gt; as a potential way of treating the disease, but they may have been off the mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study shows that clearing away the amyloid-beta clumps doesn't appear to repair key brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, it doesn't restore the brain's mechanisms for clearing out waste, known as the glymphatic system. This system is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11604-017-0617-z"&gt;known to be impaired&lt;/a&gt; in people with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="181214" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, and would usually help with getting rid of excess amyloid-beta plaques, via &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-hidden-pulse-in-the-brain-that-may-warn-of-dementia"&gt;waves of cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/a&gt; (CSF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study comes from researchers at the Osaka Metropolitan University in Japan, who tested the new Alzheimer's drug &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-slows-decline-but-comes-at-a-high-cost"&gt;lecanemab&lt;/a&gt; on 13 people with the disease. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; ( &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="181214" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt;) scans were used to look at the effects on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-heart-health-in-middle-age-could-predict-your-later-dementia-risk"&gt;Your Heart Health in Middle Age Could Predict Your Later Dementia Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even when amyloid-beta is reduced by lecanemab, impairment of the glymphatic system may not recover within the short-term," &lt;a href="https://www.omu.ac.jp/en/info/research-news/entry-95626.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; medical researcher Tatsushi Oura, of Osaka Metropolitan University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181217" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181217" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/GlymphaticSystem.jpg" alt="Glymphatic system scan" class="wp-image-181217 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/GlymphaticSystem.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/GlymphaticSystem-600x604.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181217" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A brain scan showing the diffusion of water, which was used to assess how well the glymphatic system was working. (Osaka Metropolitan University)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study highlights yet again the multifaceted nature of Alzheimer's, which is associated with a wide range of potential causes, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-15-factors-are-linked-to-early-dementia-risk-a-major-study-found"&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt;, and symptoms. It's not clear exactly how the disease starts, but various triggers are likely contributing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the buildup of amyloid-beta and another brain protein &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sky-high-levels-of-alzheimers-protein-found-in-newborns"&gt;called tau&lt;/a&gt;, these are tell-tale signs of the disease – and yet scientists are still trying to figure out whether they're causing Alzheimer's, caused by Alzheimer's, or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, lecanemab worked to the extent that it reduced amyloid-beta levels in the brain, but measures of glymphatic system function did not improve after three months. In other words, the drug doesn't seem to reverse the damage &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-may-hijack-your-cells-clocks-hinting-at-new-treatments"&gt;done by Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, at least in terms of the brain's waste recycling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Disease-modifying therapy can reduce plaque burden and slow further cognitive worsening but does not restore lost function, likely reflecting the fact that neuronal damage and clearance system deficits have already been well established," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.70118"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study adds more nuance to the increasingly complex picture of Alzheimer's, and how it &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-and-cancer-may-soon-be-treated-with-sounds-we-cant-hear"&gt;might be tackled&lt;/a&gt;. It's not the first study to find that &lt;span&gt;clearing plaques doesn't substantially improve Alzheimer's, so some researchers are now suspecting the plaques are a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-s-even-more-reason-now-to-stop-blaming-amyloid-plaques-for-alzheimer-s"&gt;consequence of the disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-might-been-wrong-what-kills-brain-cells-alzheimer-s-disease-beta-amyloid-tau-protein-app"&gt;not the cause&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-slows-decline-but-comes-at-a-high-cost"&gt;Past trials&lt;/a&gt; have shown that lecanemab does work at slowing down the steady march of Alzheimer's disease, but the drug functions best when administered at an early stage. That's why researchers are focused on trying to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-sign-deep-inside-your-eyes-could-warn-of-early-dementia"&gt;detect the signs&lt;/a&gt; of dementia &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-test-could-tell-if-you-have-early-signs-of-dementia-with-high-accuracy"&gt;as early as possible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This short study involved only a small number of people, so the researchers are keen to expand those parameters – looking at how lecanemab affects Alzheimer's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-disease-harms-the-brain-in-2-distinct-phases-study-reveals"&gt;at different stages&lt;/a&gt;, or when it's administered for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the future, we want to look at factors like age, the stage of the disease, and degree of lesions in the white matter to further understand the relationship between changes in the glymphatic system due to lecanemab treatment and the outcome of treatment," &lt;a href="https://www.omu.ac.jp/en/info/research-news/entry-95626.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Oura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will help understand the best way to administer treatment to patients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.70118"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

A new study published in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04102-x" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; Medicine shows that these drugs are also linked to a significant drop in the risk of major cardiovascular events such as strokes and heart attacks. The findings come from researchers at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and Harvard Medical School, who analysed real-world medical records to understand how these treatments perform in everyday clinical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ozempic and Mounjaro’s benefits that go beyond losing weight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Ozempic and Mounjaro are well known for their impressive weight-loss effects, the study found that their heart benefits cannot be explained by weight changes alone. According to lead author Dr Nils Krüger, the protective effects appeared early and seem to involve direct changes in the body’s cardiovascular systems. Exactly how this happens is still being researched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;What Your Cholesterol Report Is Hiding — The Truth That Could Save Your Heart | Dr Vinayak Agarwal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is important because people with type 2 diabetes face a much higher risk of heart disease than the general population. A treatment that can manage blood sugar, support weight loss and also reduce the chance of a heart attack or stroke could be a major step forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Real-world data shows strong heart protection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike clinical trials that include carefully selected volunteers, this research used insurance data from thousands of people living with type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are real patients with different ages, health conditions and lifestyle factors. By studying them, the team could see how semaglutide (Ozempic) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro) actually work in day-to-day medical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were encouraging. Semaglutide lowered the combined risk of stroke and heart attack by about 18 percent compared with sitagliptin, a diabetes drug that does not protect the heart. Tirzepatide showed a 13 percent reduction in a broader measure that included heart attack, stroke and death, when compared with dulaglutide, an older GLP-1 medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ozempic versus Mounjaro&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of talk about which drug is better. Drug companies often suggest their product offers stronger protection, but this study found only small differences between the two. In other words, both appear to work well for heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Heribert Schunkert from the TUM German Heart Centre says the findings should reassure doctors. Both medications seem to offer real cardiovascular benefits, not just improvements in weight and blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;A possible turning point in diabetes care&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1-based drugs are already changing how diabetes and obesity are treated. Now, with evidence of heart protection as well, these medicines could become key tools in preventing cardiovascular disease, which remains one of the biggest health threats worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research and direct comparisons in clinical trials are still needed. But for now, the message from this real-world study is clear. Ozempic and Mounjaro are not just helping people lose weight and control diabetes. They may also be protecting the heart in ways doctors are only beginning to fully understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

The kidneys, vital organs located in the lower back, are responsible for filtering waste, balancing electrolytes, and regulating blood pressure. Proper hydration ensures these organs work efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people believe that drinking more water can prevent kidney disease, improve kidney function, or even reverse early damage. While water is not a cure, scientific research including insights from the Chronic Kidney Disease Water Intake Trial (PMC5571765) confirms that maintaining adequate hydration is essential for kidney health. Staying hydrated helps the kidneys flush out toxins, supports filtration, and reduces the risk of complications associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) according to the study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5571765/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;PubMed Central&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Don’t Ignore Silent Kidney Damage: How to Detect Issues Before It’s Too Late | Dr Sanjeev Bagai&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How water intake supports kidney function&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water helps the kidneys filter blood efficiently. Every day, kidneys filter around 50 gallons of blood, removing waste and excess fluids to produce urine. Without enough water, waste products become concentrated, increasing stress on the renal system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adequate hydration offers several benefits for kidney function:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dilution of toxins: Proper hydration keeps urine less concentrated, reducing the risk of crystal formation and kidney stones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved filtration: Water helps maintain blood volume and pressure, allowing kidneys to filter more effectively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for electrolytes: Adequate fluid intake balances electrolytes like sodium and potassium, which are vital for muscle and nerve function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduced kidney stress: Consistent hydration reduces the workload on kidney nephrons, tiny filtering units that are susceptible to damage over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For individuals at risk of CKD or with early-stage kidney issues, these mechanisms are particularly important for maintaining kidney health over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hydration and chronic kidney disease: Why consistent water intake matters&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney disease affects millions worldwide, often developing silently over years. CKD can lead to reduced eGFR, proteinuria, and eventual kidney failure if not managed properly. Many myths exist around hydration in CKD: some believe that drinking water excessively may harm the kidneys, while others assume more water is always beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence shows that moderate, consistent hydration is crucial. Drinking water regularly helps prevent dehydration, reduces the concentration of waste in the urine, and supports overall kidney function. For people living with CKD, staying hydrated is an essential lifestyle strategy that complements medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Practical tips for maintaining kidney health through hydration&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining kidney health through water intake is about balance, consistency, and awareness. Here’s how to approach it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drink steadily throughout the day: Avoid consuming large volumes in a single sitting; smaller, frequent sips maintain consistent hydration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor urine colour: Pale yellow urine generally indicates adequate hydration; dark urine may suggest the need for more fluids.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incorporate hydrating foods: Fruits and vegetables such as watermelon, cucumber, oranges, and celery help support hydration naturally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limit high-sodium beverages: Soda, packaged drinks, and processed foods can increase kidney strain and counteract hydration benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adjust for lifestyle and climate: Hot weather, exercise, and sweating increase fluid requirements. Listen to your body’s signals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lifestyle strategies that complement hydration&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water intake alone cannot prevent kidney disease or reverse damage. Combining hydration with other healthy practices strengthens kidney protection:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood pressure control: High blood pressure accelerates kidney damage. Regular monitoring and medication, if necessary, are essential.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood sugar management: Diabetes is a leading cause of CKD. Controlling blood sugar levels reduces kidney stress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Balanced diet: Minimise processed foods, reduce salt, and increase fruits, vegetables, and lean protein.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid nephrotoxic substances: Overuse of painkillers, certain antibiotics, and excessive alcohol can damage kidneys.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular exercise: Promotes cardiovascular health and supports proper kidney perfusion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By pairing hydration with these lifestyle measures, individuals can effectively support kidney function and reduce the risk of CKD progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Common myths about water and kidney health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Myth 1: Drinking more water will cure kidney disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While hydration is essential for kidney function, drinking extra water cannot reverse kidney damage or cure chronic kidney disease (CKD). Overhydration, especially in patients with advanced CKD, may even be harmful, leading to fluid overload and strain on the heart and kidneys. Maintaining proper hydration supports kidney function but must be combined with medical management, including blood pressure control, diabetes management, and avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs according to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/healthy-hydration-and-your-kidneys" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Myth 2: All CKD patients should drink as much water as possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fluid requirements vary for individuals with CKD. Patients with advanced kidney disease or those on dialysis may need to limit water intake to prevent fluid overload, swelling, and high blood pressure. A one-size-fits-all approach is unsafe; hydration should be personalized based on kidney function, urine output, and comorbid conditions such as heart failure as per the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Myth 3: Clear urine always means perfect kidney health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While pale or clear urine often indicates good hydration, urine color alone is not a reliable marker of kidney health. Consistently clear urine may sometimes indicate overhydration, and kidney function depends on multiple factors, including filtration efficiency, presence of protein in urine (proteinuria), and overall renal health. Kidney disease can exist even if urine appears normal according to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326740" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/heart-health-warning-excess-added-sugar-in-your-diet-maybe-quietly-doubling-your-heart-attack-risk/articleshow/125243719.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Heart health warning!

As men age, their ability to absorb vitamin B12 naturally declines, making deficiency increasingly common after 50. Low B12 levels can lead to subtle but significant symptoms, particularly affecting the legs, feet, and sleep. Men may notice numbness, tingling, muscle weakness, balance issues, or restless legs at night. Early recognition of these warning signs is crucial, as prolonged deficiency can result in nerve damage, reduced mobility, and poor sleep quality. Monitoring vitamin B12 intake through diet or supplements and consulting a healthcare provider can help maintain nerve health, energy, and overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Vitamin B12 is essential for men over 50&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B12 plays several key roles in the body. It supports brain health by aiding cognitive function, which helps reduce memory loss and lowers the risk of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease. It is also essential for red blood cell production and DNA synthesis, which are critical for maintaining energy, vitality, and overall physical health. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39927551/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in Annals of Neurology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; explored the relationship between vitamin B12 levels and functional and structural biomarkers of central nervous system injury in older men, emphasising the vitamin’s vital role in supporting cognitive health and reducing age-related neurological decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Vitamin B12 rich foods for vegetarian diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, B12 contributes to heart health by regulating homocysteine levels, a compound linked to cardiovascular risk. Adequate levels also support nerve health, preventing neuropathic pain, balance issues, and mobility challenges. Maintaining healthy B12 levels allows men to stay physically and mentally active, supporting independence and quality of life during their later years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How &lt;keyword id="20686603" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="Vitamin-B12-deficiency" source="keywords"&gt;vitamin B12 deficiency&lt;/keyword&gt; in men over 50 impacts legs, feet, and sleep&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;keyword id="23600348" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="numbness-and-tingling" source="keywords"&gt;Numbness and tingling&lt;/keyword&gt; in the legs and feet&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the earliest signs of vitamin B12 deficiency is numbness or tingling in the legs and feet. Often described as a pins-and-needles sensation, this symptom can worsen at night while resting. It occurs due to nerve damage caused by insufficient B12, which is essential for keeping nerve cells healthy. Men may notice a gradual loss of sensation, affecting their comfort and sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Muscle weakness and reduced strength&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low vitamin B12 levels can lead to muscle weakness, particularly in the legs. Men over 50 may find daily activities, such as climbing stairs or walking long distances, increasingly difficult. This occurs because B12 is required for energy production and muscle repair. Without enough of this vitamin, muscles tire more easily, and recovery from physical activity slows down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Balance problems and unsteady gait&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B12 deficiency can impact balance and coordination, especially at night. Damage to nerves, including the myelin sheath that protects them, disrupts the transmission of signals to the brain. This can result in unsteady walking, increased risk of falls, and general difficulty maintaining stability. Recognising balance problems early is important to prevent injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;keyword id="21113061" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="restless-legs-syndrome" source="keywords"&gt;Restless legs syndrome&lt;/keyword&gt; and night discomfort&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a condition characterised by an irresistible urge to move the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations such as tingling or crawling feelings. Symptoms typically worsen at night, disrupting sleep. B12 deficiency affects nerve health and neurotransmitter function, both of which are critical for muscle control and movement, making men more susceptible to RLS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Burning sensations in the feet&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A burning sensation in the feet, particularly at night, may indicate peripheral neuropathy caused by B12 deficiency. This symptom arises from nerve damage, as insufficient vitamin B12 leads to degeneration of nerve tissue. The discomfort can range from mild irritation to more severe pain, affecting overall mobility and sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Leg pain and chronic discomfort&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low vitamin B12 can also cause persistent, softer leg pain that worsens at night. This pain results from nerve degeneration and can interfere with daily activities. Men may experience a range of discomfort, from mild aches to chronic, nagging pain that impacts overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cold feet and poor circulation&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold feet, even in warm conditions, may signal poor circulation due to low B12 levels. Vitamin B12 is essential for red blood cell production, and deficiency can lead to anaemia and inadequate blood flow. This reduced circulation often results in cold extremities, highlighting the importance of monitoring B12 levels for nerve and cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Disrupted sleep due to cramps and spasms&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause muscle cramps and spasms, particularly at night. These interruptions not only cause discomfort but also disrupt sleep, leading to fatigue during the day. Since B12 supports muscle function and relaxation, ensuring adequate intake can help prevent night-time cramps and improve sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any of these symptoms appear, it is essential to consult a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment. Blood tests can confirm vitamin B12 deficiency, and supplementation, either through diet, oral tablets, or injections, can restore healthy levels. Early intervention helps prevent long-term nerve damage and supports better overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men over 50 should be proactive about maintaining sufficient vitamin B12 levels, not just for energy and heart health but also to prevent nerve damage, maintain balance, reduce leg and foot discomfort, and improve sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

						&lt;p&gt;After celebrating your 30th birthday, your body changes. Hormones shift, metabolism slows, and you naturally begin to lose &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/strength-moves-lean-muscle-after-40/" target="_blank"&gt;lean muscle mass&lt;/a&gt;—a process known as sarcopenia. Without regular &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/resistance-band-exercises-burn-belly-fat/" target="_blank"&gt;resistance training&lt;/a&gt;, you can lose anywhere from &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2804956/" target="_blank"&gt;3% to 8% of muscle&lt;/a&gt; every decade. According to &lt;b&gt;Karen Ann Canham&lt;/b&gt;, CEO and founder of&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="http://www.karenannwellness.com/" target="_blank"&gt; Karen Ann Wellness&lt;/a&gt;, this means consistency is more important than intensity. Below, Canham pinpoints exactly how many days a week you should work out to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/10-minute-strength-routine-rebuild-muscle-after-40/" target="_blank"&gt;preserve muscle after 40&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Many Days a Week Should You Work Out To Maintain Muscle After 40?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For most adults, working out three to four days per week is the sweet spot to maintain muscle while allowing enough time for recovery,” Canham tells us. “Unlike in our 20s, the nervous system and recovery capacity play a much larger role after 40, so sustainable training becomes less about pushing limits and more about working with the body’s rhythms.”&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engaging in two &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/10-minute-daily-strength-workout-after-55/" target="_blank"&gt;strength-focused workouts&lt;/a&gt; per week can be enough to maintain muscle mass when combined with daily movement, including &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/mobility-drills-improve-flexibility-prevent-injury/" target="_blank"&gt;mobility work&lt;/a&gt;, walking, or light cardio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“However, three to four sessions with varying intensities deliver better results and maintain metabolic health, strength, and energy,” Canham notes. “The goal is to hit every major muscle group each week through compound movements (squats, lunges, pushes, pulls, and hinges) while balancing load and recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General training frequency is similar for both men and women, but Canham points out that hormonal differences mean the approach to exercise should be personalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Women may benefit from incorporating more restorative or mobility-focused days around their strength sessions, while men often respond well to slightly higher intensity and load variations,” Canham tells us. “In both cases, the key is building consistency rather than perfection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 40, your body best responds to moderate-to-high-intensity training with controlled volume. Intentional lifting and focusing on proper form creates better muscle activation than if you were to emphasize heavier weights or longer training sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Prioritizing recovery days, stretching, and somatic movement supports the nervous system’s ability to adapt, which is crucial for maintaining progress and avoiding burnout,” Canham says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story? After 40, it’s all about doing “what truly counts.” Being consistent with your workouts, performing mindful strength exercises, and getting sufficient rest will help you stay energized rather than fatigued.&lt;/p&gt;
