Fresh evidence shows that it’s not quite that time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence comes from an eight‑week trial led by exercise scientist &lt;a href="https://www.lehman.edu/academics/health-human-services-nursing/exercise-sciences-recreation/bradley-schoenfeld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brad Schoenfeld&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.lehman.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lehman College&lt;/a&gt;, whose team asked healthy lifters to finish one demanding set of nine classic moves twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-muscle-training-minutes"&gt;Muscle training minutes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A muscle grows when stress outweighs its usual workload, a chain that starts with mechanical tension and metabolic stress, then ends with more contractile proteins. Short sessions that reach high effort check all those boxes, even if the calendar space is small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health agencies already &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tell&lt;/a&gt; adults to hit two days of resistance work, yet fewer than one in four Americans manage the target. Shaving sessions to thirty minutes lowers the barrier without watering down the stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2022 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30153194/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;meta‑analysis&lt;/a&gt; on trained men and women reported that just three weekly thirteen‑minute bouts raised strength almost as much as forty‑minute routines when total effort matched. In other words, quality can beat quantity if each rep counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schoenfeld’s experiment now confirms the principle over a longer eight‑week window and in a mixed‑sex sample. That widens the practical appeal beyond seasoned bodybuilders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells respond to energy shortages created by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10801605/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;intense contractions&lt;/a&gt; by releasing adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase, a switch that boosts glucose uptake and supports muscle repair. Hitting that threshold does not require marathon workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-study-measured"&gt;What the study measured&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty‑two volunteers rotated through a lat pull‑down, seated row, shoulder press, chest press, triceps push‑down, supinated curl, Smith‑machine squat, leg press, and leg extension. Each visit lasted thirty minutes including brief warm‑ups and one‑minute rest periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used ultrasound to gauge thickness in the biceps, triceps, and quadriceps before and after the program. Strength, jump height, and endurance were also tested to see whether &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-fuels-neuron-growth-through-muscle-signals/"&gt;muscles&lt;/a&gt; not only grew but performed better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half the group lifted until they could not complete another strict repetition, a strategy known as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/weight-training-shields-the-aging-brain-from-dementia/"&gt;training&lt;/a&gt; to failure. The other half stopped two reps short, counting repetitions in reserve as a safety buffer for joints and nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our study, the workouts were sufficiently hard to challenge the participants’ muscles beyond their present capacity,” said Schoenfeld. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both muscle training strategies enlarged muscle fibers to a similar degree, supporting earlier &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30558493/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; showing that frequency and intensity make only small differences once weekly volume matches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A follow‑up analysis found that participants improved their ability to guess how many reps they had left, a skill that lets lifters train hard while avoiding form breakdown. That insight could help gym‑goers monitor effort without fancy devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-muscle-training-to-failure-vs-holding-back"&gt;Muscle training to failure vs holding back&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going to failure did provide a slight boost in vertical jump power, hinting that maximum effort might recruit more fast‑twitch fibers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2021 systematic &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33497853/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; echoed that idea but found little extra benefit for arm or leg size when sets finished one or two reps shy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By shortening the recovery time, it drives up metabolic stress,” noted &lt;a href="https://publichealth.buffalo.edu/exercise-and-nutrition-sciences/faculty-and-staff/faculty-directory/lpryor.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Luke Pryor&lt;/a&gt;, clinical associate professor of exercise and nutrition sciences at the &lt;a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University at Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic by‑products like lactate and hydrogen ions may act as growth signals when they accumulate quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8884877/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; from 2023 concluded that training frequency between one and three times per week yields comparable hypertrophy if the total number of quality sets is constant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means busy professionals can cluster their lifts into two focused sessions and still progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athletes chasing power for sprinting or jumping might sprinkle a third day of explosive work. Recreational lifters, however, can choose the schedule that fits job and family demands without fearing slower results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-muscle-training-for-time-pressed-people"&gt;Muscle training for time‑pressed people&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select compound patterns such as squats, deadlifts, pushups, rows, and pullups, because they rally multiple joints and force the body to use more weight. Keep rests shorter than two minutes to maintain the thirty‑minute ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I repeat this often: It doesn’t have to be the most to have a benefit,” said &lt;a href="https://sohostrengthlab.com/bios/albert-matheny/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Albert Matheny, RD, CSCS&lt;/a&gt;, co‑founder of &lt;a href="https://sohostrengthlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SoHo Strength Lab&lt;/a&gt;. Starting light lets newcomers learn form while still nudging muscles in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2021.789403/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Evidence&lt;/a&gt; from 2022 shows that even two thirteen‑minute workouts can raise lean mass if they reach a hard effort, an encouraging benchmark for people who dread long sessions. Once technique improves, individuals can add a warm‑up set or increase load to keep progress steady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strength work does more than shape arms. It preserves bone density, raises insulin sensitivity, and helps older adults stay independent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/adding-adults/what-counts.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; lists reduced anxiety, better sleep, and a lower risk of chronic disease among the bonuses of regular resistance training. Those benefits kick in long before a mirror shows new definition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-questions-that-remain"&gt;Questions that remain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The present study used mostly machine &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/resistance-exercise-may-be-the-secret-to-relieving-depression/"&gt;exercises&lt;/a&gt;, which guide motion and reduce stabilizer demand. Future trials will need to confirm whether free‑weight circuits of equal length give the same payoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample averaged twenty‑seven years old and had at least a year of lifting experience. Researchers will test the protocol in beginners and older adults, groups who often struggle to meet activity guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists also want to track hormones like testosterone and growth hormone during such brief workouts, along with markers of satellite cell activation. Those data could explain why some &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-grapes-every-day-can-transform-your-muscles/"&gt;muscles&lt;/a&gt; adapt faster than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the simplest plan stands: warm up, pick nine movements that cover the whole body, perform eight to ten deliberate reps, and close the gym bag after thirty minutes. Consistency beats elaborate programming when the clock is tight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/abstract/9900/without_fail__muscular_adaptations_in_single_set.782.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medicine &amp;amp; Science in Sports &amp;amp; Exercise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 17:25:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPRWZDaURyY2F1eUlFMzFTNVItNWFvdWVHcDV3aGRMWWZuRnQwUFpRbk84bVVOZEZRYnphbkl6Ym45ck5wTWYzRHYyM0Q5NjJ3WkFVNnB3YWZYU3BlMFl4Z3JMeFpTUlphY1d3NTNnbWwtTEo4R2d3cUxzZWhsSDVsMnZ4UGFOU24wRmRxTERLdU5wOVFvSDEyYVJ5dVJhMEhwblhKdGZIRGRUTVJO</guid></item><item><title>新州报告麻疹爆发为RFK Jr. GUTS疫苗接种-雅虎 | New State Reports Measles Outbreak as RFK Jr. Guts Vaccine Access - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxOSXl3cVBtcDd3UUNxbXhPcHRocVphSUszRkN6OVBieDVSWDNRQTNWZkNGZC1KZDNSQUtwUF9iWkFzLUdYRkx5cnhiVEdVd1Q3R1luTXdJeFdYSjVzcnRudXBXUzlyRjhVYmFwZmRVb1lZZ1lzUEkzSWR0dDN3X1VKbFln?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles is on the rise in Kentucky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health officials in the state &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chfs.ky.gov/agencies/dph/dehp/idb/Pages/measles.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:confirmed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that the disease has spread to Fayette County, marking the seventh case of the highly contagious illness in Kentucky since the beginning of the year.

Ninety-nine of those cases were hospitalized, and at least two cases—who were unvaccinated, school-aged children—have died. An &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:unvaccinated adult;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;unvaccinated adult&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in New Mexico has also died of the disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Measles hasn’t been a national concern since 2000, when the long-term use of a corresponding vaccine proved so effective at minimizing risk and exposure to the disease that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:declared measles eradicated;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;declared measles eradicated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from the United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the virus’s dormant status has been challenged by anti-vaxxers, who have opted against medicating their children in fear that vaccinations could cause autism. One such conspiracist, Secretary of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health and Human Services &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has refused to combat the ensuing measles outbreak with vetted science—instead, he has issued guidance that the illness can be treated by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/rfk-jr-makes-bonkers-claim-141001818.html" data-ylk="slk:simple vitamins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;simple vitamins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In April, Kennedy fell short of offering a full-throated endorsement of the MMR vaccine that has historically been used to treat measles, telling &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2U0csKvqMY&amp;amp;ab_channel=CBSNews" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CBS News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that his agency was focused on finding treatments for unvaccinated individuals while falsely claiming that the jab had not been “safety tested” and was not effective for long-term prevention. As of 2025, there are no known effective treatments or cures for measles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The return of historically eradicated diseases is thanks to a growing movement of anti-vaxx parents who refuse to provide their children with the same public health advantages that they received in their youth, mostly in fear of thoroughly debunked conspiracy theories. The researcher who &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/2/27/17057990/andrew-wakefield-vaccines-autism-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sparked;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;sparked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that myth with a fraudulent paper lost his medical license and eventually rescinded his opinion. Since then, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/do-vaccines-cause-autism" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dozens of studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;dozens of studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; have proven there’s no correlation between autism and vaccines, including one study that surveyed more than 660,000 children over the course of 11 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But America’s is not the first measles response that Kennedy has bungled. Under Kennedy’s stewardship, the anti-vaxx nonprofit Children’s Health Defense had its own questionable history with the disease. Preceding a deadly measles outbreak on Samoa in 2019, the organization spread rampant misinformation about the efficacy of vaccines throughout the nation, sending the island’s vaccination rate plummeting from the 60 to 70 percent range to just 31 percent, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/how-rfk-jr-falsely-denied-his-connection-to-a-deadly-measles-outbreak-in-samoa/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mother Jones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. That year, the country reported 5,707 cases of measles as well as 83 measles-related deaths, the majority of which were children under the age of five.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 16:34:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOSXl3cVBtcDd3UUNxbXhPcHRocVphSUszRkN6OVBieDVSWDNRQTNWZkNGZC1KZDNSQUtwUF9iWkFzLUdYRkx5cnhiVEdVd1Q3R1luTXdJeFdYSjVzcnRudXBXUzlyRjhVYmFwZmRVb1lZZ1lzUEkzSWR0dDN3X1VKbFln</guid></item><item><title>麻疹爆发袭击另一个州- HuffPost | Measles Outbreak Hits Another State - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOX3B0WHN3c3MxZFB3RHFzb3RQU19rZjlPeFMwaGxKaHhfczJ4eFQxZ0pCUmYtSkV4Q1FibnFCYlUtYy0xbG1iai1fWlZ4Q19oRU5IWnBZWk1EdFYyNndOMHdfektaN09OVlVYdnVOWm00R25hTTRQNHhfczNRRGE0LVIxYzN0X2tLaE9r0gGQAUFVX3lxTE9tdFNlY3ZLUG1KLTNGWXhaM19IekRWWnR2WVRncGZhd1RkM1ZLMVRLbUU2blJNb2VObXVkU1ktMG9JejYyZTVjdloyNk5PRWtmY2JNOXYtQl8tQVZkbnVTT2drNERoVnRUV09wbHJ1M1lQWWh2d2hndDViRVMtTTVEM3Nxc3dZelhlOXJmblIwRA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kentucky has its first &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-vaccine-mmr-covid-exemptions-87cbfe44d8599b68408861f9b62421ed" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="measles outbreak" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6866a6a7e4b0225e8f8bae70" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://apnews.com/article/measles-vaccine-mmr-covid-exemptions-87cbfe44d8599b68408861f9b62421ed" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; of 2025, as the U.S. case count sits just short of a 30-year high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been 1,267 confirmed measles cases this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Texas" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6866a6a7e4b0225e8f8bae70" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; confirmed three more measles cases this week tied to a major outbreak that raged through the late winter and spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three other &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-mexico-canada-ontario-0956a30c043b030ae79bc9f67c6ce89c" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="large outbreaks" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6866a6a7e4b0225e8f8bae70" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-mexico-canada-ontario-0956a30c043b030ae79bc9f67c6ce89c" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;large outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; in North America.

Patients with cancer who participated in a structured exercise program in a randomized-controlled trial lived longer without cancer recurrence and had a lower risk of dying within the trial period compared with people in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I was curious why and how exercise reduces cancer risk, and what everyone should know about incorporating exercise programs in their lives. To find out, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Why are the results of this study so important?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Previous research suggested that exercise could be beneficial for cancer survivors, but this is the first randomized trial that demonstrates exercise after cancer treatment can reduce recurrence and improve survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers recruited nearly 900 patients from 55 cancer centers across six countries who had been treated for either stage III or high-risk stage II colon cancer. Even after cancer treatments such as surgery followed by chemotherapy, colon cancer comes back in an &lt;a href="https://www.asco.org/about-asco/press-center/news-releases/movement-medicine-structured-exercise-program-challenge" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:estimated 30%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;estimated 30%&lt;/a&gt; of patients, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Many patients with recurrence of their colon cancer end up dying from their disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The patients in the new study were randomized to two groups. The control group received standard health education materials promoting healthy eating and physical activity. This is the current standard-of-care that is provided to patients in remission from their cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The other group participated in a structured exercise program that involved working with a health coach for physical activity guidance and supervised exercise sessions. During the initial six months, patients had twice-a-month coaching sessions. After that period, they met with coaches once a month, with extra sessions available if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Participants randomized to the structured exercise group had significantly higher improvements in physical function as measured by distance they could walk in six minutes and predicted &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-is-vo2-max-and-how-to-calculate-it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:VO2 max;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;VO2 max&lt;/a&gt; (your oxygen uptake), both indicators of cardiovascular fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The two groups were followed for an average of about eight years. During this period, 131 patients in the control group had recurrence of their cancer, compared with 93 in the structured exercise group. In the control group, 66 people died, compared with 41 in the structured exercise group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People in the structured exercise group had a 28% lower risk of developing recurrent or new cancers compared with those who followed standard-of-care protocols. Members of the exercise group also had a 37% lower risk of death in the trial period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This study is important because its rigorous methodology confirms what previous research had suggested: Exercise extends disease-free survival for patients with cancer and should be incorporated as part of holistic treatment for patients to reduce their risk of recurrent and new cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: How might results of the study change treatment for patients with cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Imagine if there were a clinical trial for a new drug that found it lowered the risk of developing recurrent or new cancers by 28% and lowered the risk of death in the trial period by 37%. Patients and doctors would hail this as a tremendous development and would be eager to try this new therapeutic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That’s the magnitude of the findings in this study. I believe they have the potential to substantially change cancer treatment protocols. Currently, after patients receive treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, they are given advice to exercise, but many probably do not engage the services of a health coach or trainer. Their oncologists and primary care doctors may not be asking about their physical activity regimen during follow-up care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I hope this will change, in view of these results. Patients can be counseled to have an “exercise prescription,” and health care providers can follow up to track their exercise activity. Perhaps insurance companies could even consider reimbursement for a health coach for patients with cancer; this could be seen as an investment to reduce the need for costlier chemotherapy and other treatments down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: Why and how does exercise reduce cancer risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Population studies have &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/latest-news/how-exercise-can-lower-cancer-risk.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:long shown;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;long shown&lt;/a&gt; that regular physical activity is associated with lower risks of developing certain cancers. There are &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/obesity/physical-activity-fact-sheet#how-might-physical-activity-be-linked-to-reduced-risks-of-cancer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:several theories;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;several theories&lt;/a&gt; as to why this is the case. One is that physical activity helps people stay at a healthy weight, which is notable because obesity is a risk factor for developing some cancers. In addition, exercise is thought to help regulate some hormones that are implicated in cancer development and to reduce inflammatory response that could also be involved in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: How much exercise do people need?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends&lt;/a&gt; that adults participate in at least 150 minutes of moderate to high-intensity exercise per week. For someone who is exercising five times a week, that’s about 30 minutes at a time of exercises such as a brisk walk or jog, riding a bike or swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The benefits of these exercise minutes are cumulative, meaning that individuals don’t need to do them all at once to have an effect. People who are unable to commit a period of time to exercise could consider how they could incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. Could they take the stairs instead of the elevator at work? If they do this five times a day, that could be as many as 10 minutes of exercise. Could they take a 10-minute phone meeting while walking in their neighborhood instead of sitting at a desk? Could they park a bit farther away to get in a few more minutes of physical activity? Small changes add up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What other advice do you have for people who want to begin exercise programs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Many studies show that while it’s ideal to get the recommended 150 minutes a week of exercise, there is a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/28/health/moderate-physical-activity-cancer-death-risk-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:significant benefit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;significant benefit&lt;/a&gt; from even a small amount of physical activity. The best advice I can offer is to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good — start with what you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For instance, consider the idea of “exercise snacks,” or bursts of activity that could be as short in duration as 15 or 30 seconds. These are as simple as doing a few squats or performing household chores. Getting up from your chair and just moving around helps, which is especially important for desk-bound workers who &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/health/effects-of-sitting-on-mortality-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:need additional exercise;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;need additional exercise&lt;/a&gt; to counter the negative health impacts of sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sign up for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/newsletters/fitness-life-but-better?source=nl-acq_article" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

            We all know that regular exercise has many benefits, including reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m200043b6mbil13p1p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Exercise also improves outcomes in patients with cancer, according to a new study published in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2502760" target="_blank"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. Patients with cancer who participated in a structured exercise program in a randomized-controlled trial lived longer without cancer recurrence and had a lower risk of dying within the trial period compared with people in the control group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m200053b6mhrqi7c61@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I was curious why and how exercise reduces cancer risk, and what everyone should know about incorporating exercise programs in their lives. To find out, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m200073b6m6kz7tf9u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Why are the results of this study so important?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m200083b6mf61ts82t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Previous research suggested that exercise could be beneficial for cancer survivors, but this is the first randomized trial that demonstrates exercise after cancer treatment can reduce recurrence and improve survival.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m200093b6mgef4cjd9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers recruited nearly 900 patients from 55 cancer centers across six countries who had been treated for either stage III or high-risk stage II colon cancer. Even after cancer treatments such as surgery followed by chemotherapy, colon cancer comes back in an &lt;a href="https://www.asco.org/about-asco/press-center/news-releases/movement-medicine-structured-exercise-program-challenge" target="_blank"&gt;estimated 30%&lt;/a&gt; of patients, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Many&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;patients with recurrence of their colon cancer end up dying from their disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000a3b6mfxpae85w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The patients in the new study were randomized to two groups. The control group received standard health education materials promoting healthy eating and physical activity. This is the current standard-of-care that is provided to patients in remission from their cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000b3b6m1w43pjo4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The other group participated in a structured exercise program that involved working with a health coach for physical activity guidance and supervised exercise sessions. During the initial six months, patients had twice-a-month coaching sessions. After that period, they met with coaches once a month, with extra sessions available if needed.

            Participants randomized to the structured exercise group had significantly higher improvements in physical function as measured by distance they could walk in six minutes and predicted &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-is-vo2-max-and-how-to-calculate-it" target="_blank"&gt;VO2 max&lt;/a&gt; (your oxygen uptake), both indicators of cardiovascular fitness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The two groups were followed for an average of about eight years. During this period, 131 patients in the control group had recurrence of their cancer, compared with 93 in the structured exercise group. In the control group, 66 people died, compared with 41 in the structured exercise group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            People in the structured exercise group had a 28% lower risk of developing recurrent or new cancers compared with those who followed standard-of-care protocols. Members of the exercise group also had a 37% lower risk of death in the trial period.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            This study is important because its rigorous methodology confirms what previous research had suggested: Exercise extends disease-free survival for patients with cancer and should be incorporated as part of holistic treatment for patients to reduce their risk of recurrent and new cancers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How might results of the study change treatment for patients with cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000g3b6m62d181hk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Imagine if there were a clinical trial for a new drug that found it lowered the risk of developing recurrent or new cancers by 28% and lowered the risk of death in the trial period by 37%. Patients and doctors would hail this as a tremendous development and would be eager to try this new therapeutic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000h3b6mkazkhjsu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s the magnitude of the findings in this study. I believe they have the potential to substantially change cancer treatment protocols. Currently, after patients receive treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, they are given advice to exercise, but many probably do not engage the services of a health coach or trainer. Their oncologists and primary care doctors may not be asking about their physical activity regimen during follow-up care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000i3b6mlv7qf321@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I hope this will change, in view of these results. Patients can be counseled to have an “exercise prescription,” and health care providers can follow up to track their exercise activity. Perhaps insurance companies could even consider reimbursement for a health coach for patients with cancer; this could be seen as an investment to reduce the need for costlier chemotherapy and other treatments down the line.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Population studies have &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/latest-news/how-exercise-can-lower-cancer-risk.html" target="_blank"&gt;long shown&lt;/a&gt; that regular physical activity is associated with lower risks of developing certain cancers. There are &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/obesity/physical-activity-fact-sheet#how-might-physical-activity-be-linked-to-reduced-risks-of-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;several theories&lt;/a&gt; as to why this is the case. One is that physical activity helps people stay at a healthy weight, which is notable because obesity is a risk factor for developing some cancers. In addition, exercise is thought to help regulate some hormones that are implicated in cancer development and to reduce inflammatory response that could also be involved in cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends&lt;/a&gt; that adults participate in at least 150 minutes of moderate to high-intensity exercise per week. For someone who is exercising five times a week, that’s about 30 minutes at a time of exercises such as a brisk walk or jog, riding a bike or swimming.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000n3b6m8h5zrtkn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The benefits of these exercise minutes are cumulative, meaning that individuals don’t need to do them all at once to have an effect. People who are unable to commit a period of time to exercise could consider how they could incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. Could they take the stairs instead of the elevator at work? If they do this five times a day, that could be as many as 10 minutes of exercise. Could they take a 10-minute phone meeting while walking in their neighborhood instead of sitting at a desk? Could they park a bit farther away to get in a few more minutes of physical activity? Small changes add up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Many studies show that while it’s ideal to get the recommended 150 minutes a week of exercise, there is a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/28/health/moderate-physical-activity-cancer-death-risk-wellness/index.html"&gt;significant benefit&lt;/a&gt; from even a small amount of physical activity.

            For instance, consider the idea of “exercise snacks,” or bursts of activity that could be as short in duration as 15 or 30 seconds. These are as simple as doing a few squats or performing household chores. Getting up from your chair and just moving around helps, which is especially important for desk-bound workers who &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/health/effects-of-sitting-on-mortality-wellness"&gt;need additional exercise&lt;/a&gt; to counter the negative health impacts of sitting.

&lt;p&gt;X-rays of the ankle showed swelling in the soft tissue but without some signs of infection. The doctors wondered if the man had osteomyelitis, an infection in the bone, which can be a complication in people with diabetic ulcers. The large size and duration of the ulcer matched with a bone infection, as well as some elevated inflammatory markers he had on his blood tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the bone infection further, they admitted the man to the hospital and ordered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). But the MRI showed only a soft-tissue defect and a normal bone, ruling out a bone infection. Another MRI was done with a contrast agent. That showed that the man's large arteries were normal and there were no large blood clots deep in his veins—which is sometimes linked to prolonged standing, as the man did at his laundromat job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the doctors were still working to root out the cause, they had started him on a heavy-duty regimen of antibiotics. This was done with the assumption that on top of whatever caused the ulcer, there was now also a potentially aggressive secondary infection—one not knocked out by the previous round of antibiotics the man had been given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a bunch of diagnostic dead ends piling up, the doctors broadened their view of possibilities, newly considering cancers, rare inflammatory conditions, and less common conditions affecting small blood vessels (as the MRI has shown the larger vessels were normal). This led them to the possibility of a Martorell's ulcer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ulcers, first described in 1945 by a Spanish doctor named Fernando Martorell, form when prolonged, uncontrolled high blood pressure causes the teeny arteries below the skin to stiffen and narrow, which blocks the blood supply, leading to tissue death and then ulcers. The ulcers in these cases tend to start as red blisters and evolve to frank ulcers. They are excruciatingly painful. And they tend to form on the lower legs, often over the Achilles’ tendon, though it's unclear why this location is common.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="https://www.uniklinikum-dresden.de/en/the-hospital/departments-and-institutes/otorhinolaryngology/interdisciplinary-center-smell-taste/employees/prof-dr-med-thomas-hummel"&gt;Thomas Hummel&lt;/a&gt; gets a whiff of an unripe, green tomato, he finds himself in his childhood home in Bavaria. Under the tilted ceilings of the bedroom that he shared with his two older brothers, there were three beds, a simple table and a cupboard. “My mother put those green tomatoes on the cupboard for them to ripen,” said Hummel, an olfaction researcher at the Carl Gustav Carus University Hospital in Germany. “They have this very specific smell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s grassy, green, pungent, rough and bitter, he said. When he passes by a bin of tomatoes at the market today, “it is always to some degree emotional,” he said, “like every smell is emotional.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smell is deeply tied with the emotion and memory centers of our brain. Lavender perfume might evoke memories of a close friend. A waft of cheap vodka, a relic of college days, might make you grimace. The smell of a certain laundry detergent, the same one your grandparents used, might bring tears to your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smell is also our most ancient sense, tracing back billions of years to the first chemical-sensing cells. But scientists know little about it compared to other senses — vision and hearing in particular. That’s in part because smell has not been deemed critical to our survival; humans have been wrongly considered “bad smellers” for more than a century. It’s also not easy to study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a highly dimensional sense,” said &lt;a href="https://monell.org/valentina-parma/"&gt;Valentina Parma&lt;/a&gt;, an olfactory researcher at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. “We don’t know exactly how chemicals translate to perception.” But scientists are making progress toward systematically characterizing and quantifying what it means to smell by breaking the process down to its most fundamental elements — from the odor molecules that enter your nose to the individual neurons that process them in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several new databases, including one recently published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Scientific Data&lt;/em&gt;, are attempting to establish &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-04644-2"&gt;a shared scientific language&lt;/a&gt; for the perception of molecular scents — what individual molecules “smell like” to us. And on the other end of the pathway, researchers recently published a study in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; describing how those scent molecules are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08016-5"&gt;translated into a neural language&lt;/a&gt; that triggers emotions and memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these efforts are painting a richer picture of our strongest memory-teleportation device. This higher-resolution look is challenging the long-held assumption that smell is our least important sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anosmatique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that humans are bad at smelling comes from a hundred-year-old misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="post__aside mb2 relative post__aside--right"&gt;&lt;figure class="mb2 mt1 image--shortcode s:mt-0"&gt;
    
            &lt;figcaption class="image__meta mt1"&gt;
                            &lt;div class="caption wysiwyg h5 theme__anchors--solid fill-h post__aside__caption post__aside__caption--shortcode"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;The neuroanatomist Paul Broca defined humans as &lt;em&gt;anosmatique&lt;/em&gt;, or “non-smelling,” setting off a hundred-year misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="attribution theme__anchors--solid wysiwyg pangram h6 mb1 fill-h post__aside__attribution"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;history_docu_photo/Alamy Stock Photo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 19th century, the French neuroanatomist Paul Broca was trying to explain why humans have free will and other animals don’t, despite the similarities between our brains. He pointed out that in humans, the olfactory bulbs — the primary brain areas for analysis of information flowing in from the nose — are relatively small compared to overall brain size. In contrast, the olfactory bulbs of mice and horses are massive relative to the rest of their brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He concluded that the sense of smell drives behavior, particularly irrational behavior, in animals. Humans can choose to respond to smells — but can also ignore them. This led Broca to label humans as &lt;em&gt;anosmatique&lt;/em&gt;, or “non-smellers,” and some other animals as &lt;em&gt;osmatique&lt;/em&gt;, or “smellers.” Our mastery over smell, he suggested, made us higher forms of life. “He made this big conclusion,” said &lt;a href="https://psych.rutgers.edu/people/chair-v-cs/faculty-profile/119-john-mcgann"&gt;John McGann&lt;/a&gt;, an olfactory researcher at Rutgers University. “And then he died almost immediately after that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before long, the English anatomist Sir William Turner mistranslated Broca’s findings. To him, Broca was drawing a conclusion about smelling ability rather than free will, suggesting that humans are bad smellers while dogs are good smellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Through a series of telephone games, people just kept repeating the idea, ‘Oh, humans don’t need smell,” said &lt;a href="https://hosting.med.upenn.edu/gottfriedlab/people/"&gt;Sarah Cormiea&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral researcher studying olfaction at the University of Pennsylvania. Freud didn’t help: In his various musings throughout the 20th century, he also claimed that smell was a primitive sense that merely lingered from our ancient, animalistic past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wasn’t entirely wrong. Researchers trace the mammalian sense of smell back 3 billion years to bacteria in the ancient oceans. To find food and move toward it, these organisms detected chemical gradients. Molecules in the water docked onto proteins on a bacterium’s cell membrane, triggering internal signals that urged the organism toward or away from increasing concentrations of the chemical. This ability, called chemosensation, is the most rudimentary form of smell, and it has many parallels to olfactory systems in complex, multicellular animals such as mammals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="mb2 mt1 image--shortcode s:mt-0"&gt;
    
            &lt;figcaption class="image__meta mt1"&gt;
                            &lt;div class="caption wysiwyg h5 theme__anchors--solid fill-h post__aside__caption post__aside__caption--shortcode"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;A bouquet of around 800 different molecules makes up the scent of a rose.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that sense, smell is our most ancient interface with the environment, said &lt;a href="https://liu.se/en/employee/matla69"&gt;Matthias Laska&lt;/a&gt;, a zoologist at Linköping University in Sweden. “No single cell can see or hear. But single cells already can respond to chemicals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our modern chemical sense is far more complicated. In the 1990s, the future Nobel Prize–winning biologists &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2004/7438-the-nobel-prize-in-physiology-or-medicine-2004-2004-5/"&gt;Linda Buck and Richard Axel&lt;/a&gt; discovered genes that code for odorant receptors in mammals. Later studies showed that humans have around 400 types of olfactory receptors in the nose, and that millions of these receptors line the nasal passages. Each receptor is a protein that can recognize and latch onto many kinds of odorants — molecules that are light enough to evaporate off your cup of coffee, the wet grass outside, or the microbes in your armpits, and waft into the air and, in turn, your nasal passages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="post__aside mb2 relative post__aside--right"&gt;&lt;figure class="mb2 mt1 image--shortcode s:mt-0"&gt;
    
            &lt;figcaption class="image__meta mt1"&gt;
                            &lt;div class="caption wysiwyg h5 theme__anchors--solid fill-h post__aside__caption post__aside__caption--shortcode"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Thomas Hummel has spent many decades studying the sense of smell. His colleague Antonie Bierling calls him the “European pope of olfaction.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="attribution theme__anchors--solid wysiwyg pangram h6 mb1 fill-h post__aside__attribution"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you smell a rose, more than 800 different odorants enter your nose and bind to olfactory receptors expressed in the cell membranes of various neurons, which fire to create a particular pattern interpreted by the brain. There are 5.8 million molecules on Earth that could possibly be odorants detectable by humans, although no one has the time or means to determine whether we can smell all of these, Laska said. However, we tend to underestimate our sense of smell because we lack a vocabulary for it, said &lt;a href="https://www.klipsy.uni-jena.de/en/484/antonie-bierling-m-sc"&gt;Antonie Bierling&lt;/a&gt;, who studies olfaction at the Dresden University of Technology. Visually, we might describe a pineapple as a yellow and green fruit wrapped in scaly skin. But how would you describe what a pineapple smells like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This smells like a pineapple,” Hummel said. “But we don’t know how to describe pineapple.” Our smell words are often linked to their source — for example, something smells grassy or like a wet dog or like a pineapple. He added: “What makes the pineapple a pineapple?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This difficulty with describing smells, at least in some languages like English, has limited our ability to study the human sense. Several groups of researchers are now addressing this problem systematically. It’s largely mysterious how the chemical structures of an odor molecule relate to smell, Bierling said. “The only way to change that is to create data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Molecule Smells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a light has a certain wavelength, you will describe what you are seeing as red. If a sound is a certain frequency, you will hear an F sharp. But there’s no similarly easy way to map odors, which often arrive at our noses as a bouquet of different molecules. What’s more, that bouquet can smell different to every person depending on the context in which they smell it and their past experiences with that scent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Real odors are complicated and multidimensional,” Cormiea said. “People don’t have a good understanding of what features of an odor stimulus, like a molecule, produce what perceptual experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does a flower smell like a flower, and what makes cheese smell like cheese? Odorous molecules have many dimensions that can define or affect their smell. Are they big or small? What other molecules are they interacting with? Do they have a charge? Even molecules that are mirror images of one another, &lt;a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-universe-differs-from-its-mirror-image-20250514/"&gt;a property called chirality&lt;/a&gt;, can smell completely different. For example, pine and citrus scents are opposite-handed chiral forms of the molecule limonene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

"If you get three shots, it's above 97% efficacy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In 1991, when the ACIP &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00033405.htm" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;recommended universal vaccination for hepatitis B&lt;/a&gt; among infants to decrease transmission, there were 18,000 cases of hepatitis B in those under 10 years old in the U.S., according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Since then, cases have dramatically decreased. &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-surveillance-2022/hepatitis-b/figure-2-4.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt; shows that in 2022, the rate of cases among those ages 19 was less than 0.1 per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It's very, very rare," Chin-Hong said.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk1spf002r35778ebbhab5@published"&gt;I have been dating my lovely partner “B” for six months. They haven’t met any of my friends yet: scheduling is a nightmare, we live an awkward distance apart, and college takes up basically all of our energy. I am working on organizing a get-together eventually, though not now. Complicating things, B is currently going through a severe depressive episode.&lt;br&gt;They have a mental health team, but it’s been difficult. I guess I’m asking a) how much can I share with my friends and b) if it’s imperative to ask how much I can share, how do I phrase that information request delicately?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="158" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk1ss9002s3577r0d1wcvr@published"&gt;On one hand, I feel like protecting privacy should come first, so I’ve basically just told my friends that B’s busy and had some mental health stuff going on in the vaguest terms. On the other hand, my therapist suggested I utilize my support network more since this has been really hard on me too (not more so than B, of course). Because my friends haven’t even met B, I feel like not only would this be sharing information that’s not mine to share, it’s also messing with first impressions before they’ve even all met. I’m also afraid that asking B about how much stuff I can share on how they’re doing with my friends will send them into a bad spiral about how their illness is affecting me and I should leave them (this has happened a couple times), as well as make them feel awkward around my friends when we finally make the time to meet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk1sut002t3577kqa3rzvz@published"&gt;Again, B does have professional help, but things have just been really awful lately and nothing seems to be working. I love this person and want them to be well. I know they want to be well, too. We are trying our best. Please advise!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="3" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk1sz0002u3577nyp3g428@published"&gt;—What to Say?&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmjza1k003nvcm6dpoqlfpv@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenée Desmond-Harris&lt;/strong&gt;: I admire this letter writer for trying to do the right thing here, because I wouldn’t even think about it. After just six months with someone who may or may not last another six months, I’m telling my friends (who I plan to have forever) everything. I’m not saying that’s right but I do think it’s pretty normal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk24vx002z3577wdlq2avv@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lizzie O’Leary&lt;/strong&gt;: Wow. I also want to commend this LW for her thoughtfulness, because I probably would have already unloaded a lot of this on a friend or two by now. I have been trying to think through this. and I think there is a delicate balance to strike between getting the support that you, LW, genuinely need, and not biasing your friends against a partner they haven’t met.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="180" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk24vx00303577db1yk59c@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenée&lt;/strong&gt;: I’ve given credit for thoughtfulness, and I’m not going to take it back, but as I reread the letter, what’s jumping out at me is the letter writer’s anxiety about not just the privacy aspect of this, but also a desire to control how it all turns out. She wants to make sure her friends like her partner and that her partner doesn’t get triggered by a conversation about this. And I think my advice about that is that as hard as it is, you have to let it go. Things could go wrong with your relationship or your partner’s mental health for any number of reasons. Or things could work out perfectly too! But you have to kind of let things unfold without being so afraid of making a mistake. If your relationship can’t withstand you saying “Just making sure it’s not a secret that you’re dealing with depression, in case it comes up in my life updates to me friends” and if your friends hold a grudge against someone who (hopefully) makes you happy, that’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="160" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk24vy00313577m1i2efb8@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lizzie&lt;/strong&gt;: So, as someone who has been both clinically depressed AND dated people who are clinically depressed, I think the LW can talk about this to her friends without asking for permission. Especially since that might set off a spiral (depressed people feel worthless as hell). She doesn’t need to go deep into all her partner’s issues, because that’s not really the point here. The point is that the LW needs support. And so it’s okay to talk about the things in her life that are difficult right now! This is … what friendship is for. I also think that a) we are at a place in society where there is a general understanding that sometimes People Go Through Some Shit, b) LW’s friends are going to form an opinion anyway, and that will fluctuate over time and no one can control that. Check me on this, Jenée, does the LW have to ask for an okay from her partner?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk24vz003235778zwwrahc@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenée&lt;/strong&gt;: The more I think about it, the more I think no. My big reading-between-the-lines conspiracy theory about this one is that the partner is not just depressed but also not treating her very well because of the depression (“This has been really hard on me” could be doing a lot of work). And she is hesitant to share that with her friends because they may legitimately have a bad impression of her partner. So she is—consciously or not—looking for other reasons not to share.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk24vz00333577806hqq61@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lizzie&lt;/strong&gt;: Ohhhhhh that is a very interesting reading! You may be right. I guess it’s a question of how much LW needs the support. Because I think someone who is feeling really bad about themselves might not be able to see the request to share as anything other than a referendum on them. So the LW would really need to lean into “this is about me and wanting to talk about my feelings.” And I am not sure how the partner will take that. So, yeah, share, but be discreet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="109" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk24vz00343577kubzl2q2@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenée&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, I think she should just organize a brunch and give her life updates and get the support she needs. Maybe it’s “They’ve been depressed and it’s been hard because I care so much about them” or maybe it’s “They’ve been depressed and there are days when that makes them really mean to me and they say they can’t see a future with me because of it.” I mean she doesn’t have to include medication doses and side effects of anything. But if your therapist says to lean on your friends, do it! And don’t edit too heavily when it comes to what exactly has been going on.&lt;/p&gt;

But even plain old iron deficiency anemia can be extremely debilitating and difficult to treat."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I have regular old iron deficiency anemia. It's caused by extremely heavy and constant menstruation from a combination of uterine fibroids and bilateral ovarian masses that are quite literally the size of small melons. I am scheduled for surgery in September, but I need to manage as best I can until then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The fatigue and tiredness I feel are beyond description. Some days, I can barely even make myself get up to go to the bathroom. Most days, I can only muster up enough energy to be functional for a couple of hours. I can't drive long distances anymore. I'm worried it's not safe. I'm always cold, my hair is falling out, and my skin is dry and itchy. I also get sores in my mouth and bruises that never heal. I take supplements, eat an iron-rich diet, and have infusions, but it's slow going to actually see improvement. The anemia and the treatments I've undergone to help fix it have caused a cascade of other vitamin and mineral deficiencies that have their own side effects. I can't be out in the sun, or I break out in hives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some of my issues have been caused by the bleeding itself, like dehydration and hypovolemia. People, even some doctors, don't understand that severe cases of anemia can be debilitating. My whole life is more or less on pause right now because of these issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Productivitycafe/comments/1lm7onn/what_is_a_medical_condition_that_is_more_serious/n05n3jp/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:kmill0202;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;kmill0202&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;18.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"PCOS. While it's not disabling, the symptoms have dominated my life since puberty and into my 30s and foreseeable future. It's not just irregular periods and intense pain when it comes. It's been nearly two decades of battling with acne that is more than 'you need to wash your face and use topicals.' It's endless frustration being told that to get rid of it, I must lose weight. Not understanding why the same diet and exercise regimens weren't working for me as for my friends, only to learn at 30 that PCOS gives me insulin resistance and I have to eat less and completely differently."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"A battle to look normal.

It's definitely commonly recognized and treated, but I don't think most non-ADHD people truly understand how frustrating it is to live with it. Your whole life revolves around it, because unless you're always keeping it in check, you can't live in normal society, and it's fucking exhausting having to always be hyper aware of everything you do. Your productivity, your memory, your sensory perception, all of that, is, by default, hindered permanently compared to a neurotypical person, but unfortunately, most things are built around neurotypical capabilities (working 9-5, etc.), and it's so mentally draining to force yourself to adapt to that culture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Meds and good habits help, but they can only do so much. No matter what you do or take, you will sooner or later fall into a cycle of procrastination, of forgetfulness, of 'ADHD paralysis,' of sensory overstimulation, and it fucking sucks because it's so difficult to explain to people. It's become so normalized that most people, at least the ones I've talked to, think you're overplaying it or that it's not that big of a deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Productivitycafe/comments/1lm7onn/what_is_a_medical_condition_that_is_more_serious/n07acsx/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Frysken;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Frysken&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;21.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;And finally, "Impacted wisdom teeth. I almost died from mine. One day, I woke up with a toothache and went to the ER. They sent me home, said you have a toothache, go see a dentist. The next day, it was swollen, and the pain was worse, so I went to a different ER. They gave me painkillers and told me to go see a dentist. The next day, I woke up, and my eye was swollen shut."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"My throat was swollen, and I had trouble breathing. Went to a third ER where they told me I had an abscess from impacted wisdom teeth, and the swelling was very close to my brain. If I had waited another hour, I'd be dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So I went from a minor toothache to almost dead in about three days.

&lt;p&gt;If they don’t grow in right, most people will treat their wisdom teeth as bio-baggage, useful only for preventing money from burning a hole in one’s pocket due to the surgical costs of removing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But an astounding new discovery has found that this third set of molars contain a unique form of human stem cell that can be harvested and used to regrow bone, heart tissue, and even neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an exciting field full of promise, full of potential benefits, but substantial amounts of further research and evidence is needed to truly understand what these four extra teeth could do for us in the long term beyond tearing up almonds and salad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, wisdom teeth contain a soft center of tissue called dental pulp that keeps the tooth alive. This pulp contains immature cells which a team of scientists at the University of the Basque Country in Spain have transformed into several different kinds of cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gaskon Ibarretxe, an associate professor in the Cell Biology and Histology Department at the university, led&lt;a href="https://stemcellres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13287-025-04134-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; a recent study&lt;/a&gt; that turned pulp cells into electrically excitable pseudo-neurons that demonstrated “essentially electrical activity” in concert with proper neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They could help treat damaged brain circuitry from any number of conditions or trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dental-pulp-stem-cells-from-extracted-wisdom-teeth-can-treat-multiple-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Earth.com,&lt;/a&gt; pulp-derived stem cells have some interesting and unique properties, including the capacity to build mineralized tissue faster than bone marrow-derived stem cells. Scientists have used dental‑pulp secretions to improve heart ejection fractions in mice with heart failure, and &lt;em&gt;in vitro, &lt;/em&gt;these cells seem to lay down layers of collagen and calcium in neat, orderly sheets, making them potentially attractive for joint cartilage repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the logistics and cost standpoint, they’re an ideal source of stem cells. Bone marrow cells require painful injections that sometimes can’t involve anesthesia, while embryonic or placental stem cells without ethical concerns require someone to decide to have a baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE DENTISTRY ADVANCES: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="UPDATE—World’s First Drug to Regrow Teeth Enters Clinical Trials" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/update-worlds-first-drug-to-regrow-teeth-enters-clinical-trials/" rel="bookmark"&gt;UPDATE—World’s First Drug to Regrow Teeth Enters Clinical Trials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, almost all humans are born with wisdom teeth, and they’re often removed in the teenage years when little DNA damage has taken place inside the dental pulp; making them exceptionally malleable and safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earth.com claims 10 million wisdom teeth are removed every year, but the process of sending them to a biobank could be very simple. A kit—offered by a company like &lt;a href="https://stemodontics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Stemodontics&lt;/a&gt;—could be bought and shipped to a dentist’s office ahead of the procedure. The tooth is put in a vial, placed on dry ice, and rushed to a lab where the pulp would be extracted and preserved as a potentially life-changing form of cellular insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE DENTISTRY ADVANCES: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="These Micro-robots Can Clean Teeth By Shapeshifting into Toothbrush or Floss Forms" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/swarm-of-micro-robots-can-clean-teeth-by-shapeshifting-into-toothbrush-or-floss-forms/" rel="bookmark"&gt;These Micro-robots Can Clean Teeth By Shapeshifting into Toothbrush or Floss Forms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No donor cells means no risks of rejection, which means no waiting list for finding a matching donor; the dental-pulp cells would be available as soon as they’re needed. If covered by a dental insurance plan, their storage could result in tens of thousands of dollars saved down the line if some of these treatments prove executable and effective.&lt;/p&gt;

However, when high doses of acetaminophen are taken, or if glutathione levels are low from factors like &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-aa5e1f00-5784-11f0-8c41-85aceef8cdd2"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; use or malnutrition, the liver's capacity to process and eliminate NAPQI becomes overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When NAPQI is not properly detoxified, it can accumulate in the liver and bind to essential cellular proteins, leading to cell injury and potentially liver failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A top doctor has warned how a common medication could cause lasting damage in the long-term, with organ failure and dementia being among the side effects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Melillo says the risk of liver damage increases significantly when the dose of acetaminophen exceeds 4,000mg daily in adults. This equates to more than eight Tylenol PM pills. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He highlights that acetaminophen is an ingredient in many medicines, not just Tylenol PM, so he recommends checking to see which products contain it and the quantities. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He doesn't recommend against acetaminophen completely but says it should be used sparingly and not habitually. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says the prevalence of it is one of the reasons why there is so much liver damage in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver disease in some form affects one in three Americans, adding up to 100million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In January 2011, the FDA asked manufacturers of combination drugs containing acetaminophen to limit acetaminophen doses to no more than 325 mg in each tablet or capsule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because there's no data showing that taking more than 325 mg per dosage unit provides additional benefit while outweighing the increased risk of liver injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the recommendations, each Tylenol PM tablet contains 500 mg of acetaminophen to relieve pain and 25 mg diphenhydramine to help you go to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research also found that acetaminophen could &lt;span&gt;alter the perception of risk by making certain activities seem less dangerous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in the study ingested two acetaminophen tablets (1,000 mg) of the drug or a placebo and were asked to rate certain activities based on risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those under the influence of the of the drug rated activities like bungee jumping, skydiving or starting a new career in your mid-30s as less risky than those who took the placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2020 study, conducted by The Ohio State University, built on previous work that determined acetaminophen impacts the user's psychosis, as it was found to reduce positive and negative emotions, such as hurt feelings, concern of other's suffering and even their own joy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Melillo also dislikes Tylenol PM for its other main ingredient, diphenhydramine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is an antihistamine, which means it blocks histamine, a chemical in the body that promotes wakefulness, leading to drowsiness and helping with sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Melillo says that most people will be more familiar with the medication by its brand name, Benadryl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Explaining why he isn't a fan of diphenhydramine, he said it could 'possibly cause memory loss.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diphenhydramine is an anticholinergic medication, meaning it blocks the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is essential for memory and cognitive function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It is one of America's top-selling nighttime painkillers and it grosses sales close to $1 billion each year. But Dr Melillo warns that the over-the-counter (OTC) medication designed to provide temporary relief from occasional headaches and minor aches and pains is 'misused' by many patients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By blocking its action, diphenhydramine can impair these functions, leading to memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study found that taking an anticholinergic for the equivalent of three years or more on a daily basis was associated with a 54 percent higher dementia risk than taking the same dose for three months or less. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other side effects of diphenhydramine, Dr Melillo says, include dry mouth and urinary retention (an inability to empty the bladder).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says for older patients, these symptoms can prove particularly troublesome as they could trigger other age-related health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If people need help sleeping, the pharmacist advises talking to a doctor about prescription medications that are available instead of turning to Tylenol PM or Benadryl, which they could become dependent upon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds: 'If you're someone who takes this on a blue moon, then that's fine, it's not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But this should not be your go to medication for sleep every night... because you're gonna want to prevent long term complications.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 12:50:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQTUx6YzhTWXFITEgwZDM2NWlvb2xsQWdMV1FwZUZzLU9tVHp2aHp1RUEwVUE1SWNCOEhkSDFjOU5aLWtxUUJydmdoT2NWTzE2SXQ3WHNkd1o2SHZDRVF0NW9qdU5MNk5kYldxYkRRUEhabUUzWnp5VW1JaWJ5bjBsZDZBOHFKdkVxc0NQVnpURWtVVDjSAZgBQVVfeXFMTnhaUExEQlYzb0xaU0JRN2hMTFlveWVwcDhiRlotWFhtc3cxLTZ4ZUZmTGptWDI1RkhCWVdUdTN2cURfT2dHOFZpU0pQZnZMeEpaOTNYOUYxTUJhZXhCMk5TWE5pX3ZCWkREX1FIb19qbUZub3NCRGtBb2R0OVBNY1B6NkNDQU8yeEtRRlRSRUNXTl91TFM1MGs</guid></item><item><title>肯塔基州麻疹爆发加剧了幼儿园儿童的恐惧-新闻 | Kentucky Measles Outbreak Raises Fear for Kindergarteners - Newser</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxOQXVOdlA5OFViU2N6Qi0zUndEenprZ1dLQnRwczU4eGZRQ3ZSYTdYSU5yRktSREJGcWFZc3I0eWYyeUctRHFUc1BIRFlQUERrRXZkQTRFdHRybFVEZ3BxdE96d1VYcnFZc1VZUjNfOEtuamRNWlpUcXBlRUkyazVGYi1Cc0N3a1FPdEtrWnIyUlVsUUhoVEFXT05IbGNpelU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="divStoryBodyAbove"&gt;

                                        A measles outbreak has emerged in central Kentucky. There are four confirmed cases: Three were confirmed in Woodford County before a fourth emerged in nearby Fayette County, per &lt;a href="https://www.wkyt.com/2025/06/30/officials-announce-measles-outbreak-central-kentucky/"&gt;WKYT&lt;/a&gt;. The Kentucky Department of Public Health has also reported a confirmed measles exposure in Jessamine County. Officials say one measles case confirmed in Todd County last week is not related to the outbreak. Kentucky's total measles cases for the year is now at 7. Six cases occurred in people who were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown, with one appearing in an individual with just one dose of the two-dose measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, which is 97% effective against preventing infection.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

                                        A dozen US states are experiencing active measles outbreaks, involving three or more related cases. Major outbreaks are occurring in Texas, New Mexico, in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Alberta, and in Chihuahua, Mexico. Texas confirmed three more cases on Tuesday, bringing its total to 753, though fewer than 10 are actively infectious, per the &lt;a href="https://www.newser.com/article/e5d928e41fd6b3dc6ade087662d61c5c/kentucky-confirms-measles-outbreak-as-us-nears-its-highest-case-count-in-more-than-30-years.html"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt;. New Mexico had counted 94 cases as of Friday. Officials in Kentucky are especially concerned because the vaccination rate among kindergartners is below 87%, compared to the national average of 93%, per &lt;a href="https://www.wtvq.com/health-officials-warn-of-measles-exposure-risk-in-central-kentucky-as-outbreak-grows/"&gt;WTVQ&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Steven Stack, Kentucky's secretary for Health and Family Services, notes one infected person can spread measles to up to 18 others who are unvaccinated, so "the message is real simple: Get vaccinated."
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Popular weight-loss drugs like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-ozempic-and-why-are-people-saying-its-a-sad-way-to-lose-weight"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/tirzepatide-subcutaneous-route/description/drg-20534045"&gt;Zepbound&lt;/a&gt; have revolutionized how we &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-simple-strategy-for-weight-loss-outperforms-daily-dieting-study-says"&gt;tackle obesity&lt;/a&gt;. But now, emerging reports about potential side effects have prompted a new investigation by UK health regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of people reported experiencing severe &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"&gt;pancreas&lt;/a&gt; problems after taking these drugs, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4ged0r1n3wo"&gt;the BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK government is now asking anyone who's been affected to contact them. They are particularly interested in understanding whether genetic factors may predispose certain individuals to such severe reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always with health alerts, it's crucial to put this news into perspective. There's no clear evidence yet that these drugs are directly &lt;em&gt;causing&lt;/em&gt; pancreas damage. Their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-vs-wegovy-the-risks-and-side-effects-of-semaglutide-drugs"&gt;known side effects&lt;/a&gt; are already well-documented and they remain approved as safe for use when prescribed and overseen by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-alternative-ditches-the-needle-and-one-major-side-effect?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Ozempic Alternative Ditches The Needle And One Major Side Effect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that last part – doctor oversight – is vital: it's not safe to obtain these drugs through unofficial channels. Even if you can be sure you're getting what you asked for – which you can't – these medications &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weight-loss-drugs-like-ozempic-can-leave-lasting-damage-in-your-mouth"&gt;aren't right for everyone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that when &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/largest-covid-vaccine-study-ever-reveals-the-actual-health-risks-you-face"&gt;any medication is taken up by a large number of people&lt;/a&gt;, it will inevitably reach some who will experience health issues regardless of the drugs they're on, and rare adverse reactions will likely also occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the sheer number of reports of acute or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"&gt;chronic pancreatitis&lt;/a&gt; warrants further examination, and the cases so far involve up to 10 fatalities. The investigation is being managed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and Genomics England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectively, the drugs being looked at are known as GPL-1 (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1"&gt;glucagon-like peptide-1&lt;/a&gt;) receptor agonists, because they target cells in the body usually activated by the natural GLP-1 hormone, which controls blood sugar and appetite – hence why they're used for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="166142" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166145" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166145" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/PancreasOrgan.jpg" alt="Pancreas organ" class="wp-image-166145 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/PancreasOrgan.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/PancreasOrgan-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166145" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Issues have been reported with pancreas conditions. (Sebastian Kaulitzki/Science Photo Library/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These medications can be split into two types: those based on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaglutide"&gt;semaglutide&lt;/a&gt; (such as Ozempic and Wegovy), and those based on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirzepatide"&gt;tirzepatide&lt;/a&gt; (including Mounjaro and Zepbound). The latter type also targets &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_inhibitory_polypeptide"&gt;glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide&lt;/a&gt; (GIP) receptors, as well as GLP-1 receptors, for a stronger effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, almost 400 reports of acute pancreatitis have been received from people using GLP-1 drugs such as Mounjaro, Wegovy, Ozempic, and liraglutide, as per &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/26/weight-loss-diabetes-jab-users-report-pancreas-problems"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly half of those, 181, involve the tirzepatide-based drug sold as Mounjaro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-genetic-risk-for-disease-can-be-changed-by-your-environment"&gt;Genetic risk&lt;/a&gt; is one of the factors being studied, which may mean some people are more prone to pancreatic issues. In the case of acute or chronic pancreatitis, this manifests itself as severe stomach pain that won't go away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those in the UK aged over 18, who have a strong adverse reaction to one of these weight loss and diabetes drugs &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/if-you-take-a-glp-1-medicine-and-have-been-hospitalised-by-acute-pancreatitis-the-yellow-card-biobank-wants-to-hear-from-you"&gt;are being asked to register&lt;/a&gt; their details on the &lt;a href="https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/"&gt;Yellow Card website&lt;/a&gt; (the official UK system for reporting issues with approved medications).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, you'll be asked to submit more information and a saliva sample, if you're chosen to take part in a study of GLP-1 drugs and pancreatic issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of all medications have to be considered in relation to other factors, including existing health conditions, genetics, age, and sex. Even the most effective drugs can come &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/worlds-most-common-pain-relief-drug-may-induce-risky-behavior-study-finds"&gt;with risks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"GLP-1 medicines like Ozempic and Wegovy have been making headlines, but like all medicines there can be a risk of serious side effects," &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/if-you-take-a-glp-1-medicine-and-have-been-hospitalised-by-acute-pancreatitis-the-yellow-card-biobank-wants-to-hear-from-you"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; geneticist Matt Brown from Genomics England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe there is real potential to minimize these, with many adverse reactions having a genetic cause."&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“You should be ashamed”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AOC sums up the Big Ugly Rich People Scam in less than 90 seconds...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They scammed, stole from, and fucked over 99 percent of us in broad daylight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy birthday, America. Enjoy your &lt;s&gt;cake&lt;/s&gt; crumbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And now, our feature presentation...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheers and Jeers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, July 3, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tomorrow morning around 8am ET we’ll perform the annual posting of C&amp;amp;J’s &lt;u&gt;first&lt;/u&gt; column, written back on July 4, 1776 to celebrate the birth of our baby Republic that would grow up to eventually swallow itself after ingesting a toxic cocktail of greed, power, citizen apathy, and Pop Rocks. No evening C&amp;amp;J, and we'll be back bright and early on Monday morning. In conclusion: God bless Canada.  —&lt;em&gt;Mgt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;7 days!!!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;By the Numbers:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Days 'til fall: &lt;strong&gt;81&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Days 'til the &lt;a href="https://elsiedairyfestival.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elsie Dairy Festival&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Elsie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michigan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Percent of Americans polled by NPR/PBS/Marist who believe that democracy is "under serious threat" here: &lt;strong&gt;76%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Odds that the Fed will hold interest rates steady at its July 29-30 meeting, according to futures activity, compared with a 19% chance of a quarter-point rate cut: &lt;strong&gt;81%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Percent chance that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Extreme heat is no longer a rare event , it has become the new normal, no country is immune," according to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres: &lt;strong&gt;100%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Average daytime high temperature in July at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Four Corners&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;National Monument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;93F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Year that Independence Day was made a formal federal holiday:&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1941&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Thursday Molly Ivins Moment:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Happy birthday, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;America&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;! Ye Olde Fourth of July rolls around again and finds the Great Nation in, frankly, a somewhat pissy mood. Lots of blame game, name-slinging and general unpleasantness. But there's always an upside. The vice president reports that if you go ahead and let fly with the f-word, it makes you feel better. Anything to get that fun Dick Cheney back to his usual sunny self, I always say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image-captioned width-md align-left"&gt;&lt;img alt="Molly Ivins" src="https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/826634/large/MollyIvins.jpg?1593636143" title="Molly Ivins"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;True, we seem to have had more halcyon national natal days, but if we ignore &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Iraq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; for the weekend, we should be able to celebrate our national heritage without punching each other in the eye.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;So let's salute all that makes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;America&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; special, starting with us, the people. Here's to all the musicians from country to hip-hop to rock to classical to jazz to folk to be-bop to &lt;em&gt;norteno&lt;/em&gt; to polka to reggae, and to all the fusion forms thereof. Here's to all the artists who get no respect—the washboard players and lute strummers, harmonica blowers and banjo pickers. Here's to their endless generosity in playing special benefits for retired musicians who are ill and have no health insurance, all over &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;America&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, every night. And here's to the great Ray Charles, bless his heart. May we all hear his version of "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;America&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; the Beautiful" this holiday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;—July 2004&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Puppy Pic of the Day: &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jessigrace.bsky.social/post/3lsp434krtc2i" target="_blank"&gt;Tis the season…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHEERS &lt;/strong&gt;to taking out the trash. Hey, everybody! Here's something that's as rare as a functioning MAGA brain cell: actual &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; abortion news. We take you now to Wisconsin where, if recent elections for justices on the state's highest court had swung a different way, we wouldn’t be reading this right now. But they didn't, so…&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/wisconsin-supreme-court-strikes-states-1849-total-abortion-ban-rcna216300" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Wednesday formally struck down an abortion ban from1849 that had technically retaken effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image-captioned align-left"&gt;&lt;img alt="Justice Rebecca Bradley listens during the oral arguments at the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2019AP559, League of Women Voters v. Tony Evers, at the Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison, Wisconsin Wednesday, May 15, 2019.

Tony Evers, at the Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison, Wisconsin Wednesday, May 15, 2019. (Steve Apps/Wisconsin State Journal via AP)"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;MAGA Wisconsin justice Rebecca Bradley has a sad.&lt;br&gt;
And that gives me a happy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a 4-3 decision that came down along ideological lines, the court’s liberal majority affirmed a lower court ruling that overturned the 176-year-old ban and left in place a more recent law in Wisconsin allowing most abortions until about the 20th week of pregnancy. […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ruling is a win for abortion rights activists in the battleground state, where Democrats had put the issue at the forefront of many elections—including two races in 2023 and 2025 that recalibrated the state Supreme Court's ideological balance—in the years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate the good news, Wisconsin will now send everyone in the country a large chunk of their delicious cheddar cheese absolutely free. (But you'll have to buy your own crackers and summer sausage. Budget cuts.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JEERS &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;to idle hands. The dream of our illustrious commerce secretary Crack T. Whip to produce a thriving economy based on an army of middle class Americans screwing tiny screws into tiny screw holes in tiny iPhones 14 hours a day remains a "work" in progress. (See what I did there?) But he might want to step it up if today's employment report from the newly-named Federal Bureau Of Get To Work You Lazy Slackers matches &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/adp-jobs-report-june-2025.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what dropped in our laps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; yesterday:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private sector hiring unexpectedly contracted in June, payrolls processing firm ADP said Wednesday, in a possible sign that the economy may not be as sturdy as investors believe. […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image-captioned align-right"&gt;&lt;img alt="Down-Arrow.jpg" src="https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/843470/large/Down-Arrow.jpg?1597355263" title="Down-Arrow.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The new national seal of the United States.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private payrolls lost 33,000 jobs in June, the ADP report showed, the first decrease since March 2023. Economists polled by Dow Jones forecast an increase of 100,000 for the month. The May job growth figure was revised even lower to just 29,000 jobs added from 37,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The bulk of job losses came in service roles tied to professional and business services and health and education, according to ADP.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Today's government report drops at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;8:30 ET&lt;/span&gt;. Fearless prediction: the biggest gains will be in the previously-underperforming "American Concentration Camp Alligator Poop Scooper" sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHEERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;to Men and women in Black.  The now-hapless Secret Service (America eventually ruins everything) went to work this week in 1865.  Its original intent was to prevent the spread of counterfeit currency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It wasn't until after the McKinley assassination that the service began protecting the president.  Which reminds me: if you ever want to intimidate someone, just stare at them while talking into your wrist.  (The old lady across the street is now poppin' Prozac like candy...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BRIEF SANITY BREAK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;END BRIEF SANITY BREAK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHEERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;to greenbacks. In a famous first, during this week in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; 1785&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Congress agreed that the dollar would officially become&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;America&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;’s first “unit of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;currency.” Also during this week in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; 1785&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the American public agreed that the dollar would, in their households, officially become&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;America&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;’s first "endangered species."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;CHEERS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;to today's edition of &lt;em&gt;Oops, Did We Do Thaaat???&lt;/em&gt;  Take a bow, boycotters. You have effectively rocked a very evil man back on his hooves. Via &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/tesla-sales-fell-13-months-anti-musk-sentiment-123409243" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABC News&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sales of Tesla electric cars fell 13% in the last three months as boycotts over Elon Musk's political views continue to keep buyers away, a significant development given expectations that anger with the company's billionaire CEO would have faded by now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The plunging sales add to growing signs that Musk's embrace of U.S. President Donald Trump and far-right politicians in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Europe&lt;/span&gt; has had a deep and enduring hit to the Tesla’s brand appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been today's edition of &lt;em&gt;Oops, Did We Do Thaaat???&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ten years ago in C&amp;amp;J: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 3, 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;CHEERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; to getting a second opinion.  The Commerce Department now says &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;that the first-quarter Gross Domestic Product fell far less (0.2% vs. 0.7%) than originally estimated, thanks to stronger numbers on consumer spending and exports.  But looking ahead, the financial experts all agree on one thing: the fate of this quarter is completely in your hands, lemonade stand kids.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And just one more…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;CHEERS&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;to blowing this popsicle stand. Every time you go outside on a clear night you’re doing yourself a grave disservice if you don’t look up and gasp as you realize that the universe up there is pretty spectacular. The elves at NASA are also aware of this, so they always let us in on the big celestial events for the month. Here’s a look at July’s skywatching tips, including hot planet-on-planet action and the eagle’s awe-inspiring wingspan:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="AlignRight"&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And if there are any benevolent societies out there in the cosmos reading this who are good at solving problems on planets inhabited by self-immolating halfwits:&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Help!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a nice Thursday. Floor's open...What are you cheering and jeering about today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today's Shameless C&amp;amp;J Testimonial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This is just the beginning of our expanding coalition to make the &lt;em&gt;Cheers and &lt;/em&gt;Jeers kiddie pool swimmable. And we will do it together."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            After trying to conceive for 18 years, one couple is now pregnant with their first child thanks to the power of artificial intelligence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000k3b6nrr2y9w57@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The couple had undergone several rounds of in vitro fertilization, or IVF, visiting fertility centers around the world in the hopes of having a baby.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmf201m00053b6m9awjjxfe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The IVF process involves removing a woman’s egg and combining it with sperm in a laboratory to create an embryo, which is then implanted in the womb.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbu8oa00093b6nf0ghsnlj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But for this couple, the IVF attempts were unsuccessful due to azoospermia, a rare condition in which no measurable sperm are present in the male partner’s semen, which can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK578191/" target="_blank"&gt;male infertility&lt;/a&gt;. A typical semen sample contains hundreds of millions of sperm, but men with azoospermia have such low counts that no sperm cells can be found, even after hours of meticulous searching under a microscope.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000l3b6n3lvqcy8p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So the couple, who wish to remain anonymous to protect their privacy, went to the Columbia University Fertility Center to try a novel approach.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmdnudj00013b6m68o4dsgg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s called the STAR method, and it uses AI to help identify and recover hidden sperm in men who once thought they had no sperm at all. All the husband had to do was leave a semen sample with the medical team.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbx31v000i3b6n338hjj9h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We kept our hopes to a minimum after so many disappointments,” the wife said in an emailed statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000m3b6nphdol06y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers at the fertility center analyzed the semen sample with the AI system. Three hidden sperm were found, recovered and used to fertilize the wife’s eggs via IVF, and she became the first successful pregnancy enabled by the STAR method.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcme7brl00003b6n519tsg40@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The baby is due in December.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000p3b6ne6bxhskd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It took me two days to believe I was actually pregnant,” she said. “I still wake up in the morning and can’t believe if this is true or not. I still don’t believe I am pregnant until I see the scans.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmdkgvw00003b6makwzv38y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Artificial intelligence has advanced the field of fertility care in the United States: More medical facilities are using AI to help assess egg quality or screen for healthy embryos when patients are undergoing IVF. There’s still more research and testing needed,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;but AI may now be making advancements in male infertility, in particular.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn00053b6nbppfof31@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Zev Williams, director of the &lt;a href="https://www.obgyn.columbia.edu/profile/s-z-williams-md" target="_blank"&gt;Columbia University Fertility Center&lt;/a&gt;, and his colleagues spent five years developing the STAR method to help detect and recover&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;sperm in semen samples from people who had azoospermia.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmcocek001g3b6nb5iw4wtz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They were struck by the system’s results.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn00063b6n53a8t9tu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A patient provided a sample, and highly skilled technicians looked for two days through that sample to try to find sperm. They didn’t find any. We brought it to the AI-based STAR System. In one hour, it found 44 sperm. So right then, we realized, ‘Wow, this is really a game-changer. This is going to make such a big difference for patients,’ ” said Williams, who led the research team.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn00073b6n5b0i8yv9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When a semen sample is placed on a specially designed chip under a microscope, the STAR system – which stands for Sperm Tracking and Recovery – connects to the microscope through a high-speed camera and high-powered imaging technology to scan the sample, taking more than 8 million images in under an hour to find what it has been trained to identify as a sperm cell.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmdwait000a3b6m9d9vwgat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The system instantly isolates that sperm cell into a tiny droplet of media, allowing embryologists to recover cells that they may never have been able&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to find or identify with their own eyes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000a3b6nr2rsfwqm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s like searching for a needle scattered across a thousand haystacks, completing the search in under an hour and doing it so gently, without any harmful lasers or stains, that the sperm can still be used to fertilize an egg,” Williams said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000b3b6neqpgfn97@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What’s remarkable is that instead of the usual [200 million] to 300 million sperm in a typical sample, these patients may have just two or three. Not 2 [million] or 3 million, literally two or three,” he said. “But with the precision of the STAR system and the expertise of our embryologists, even those few can be used to successfully fertilize an egg.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmcm3z7z2001h3b6nobm6mw1c@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="shocking-and-unexpected-diagnosis" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        ‘Shocking and unexpected diagnosis’
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000c3b6njwx4o87g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s estimated that the male partner accounts for &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562258/" target="_blank"&gt;up to 40% of all infertility cases&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8304267/" target="_blank"&gt;up to 10% of men with infertility&lt;/a&gt; are azoospermic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000d3b6n566ixjxe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This often is a really heartbreaking and shocking and unexpected diagnosis,” Williams said. “Most men who have azoospermia feel completely healthy and normal. There’s no impairment of their sexual function, and the semen looks normal, too. The difference is that when you look at it under a microscope, instead of seeing literally hundreds of millions of sperm swimming, you just see cell debris and fragments but no sperm.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000e3b6n2kkpl6pw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Treatment options for azoospermia traditionally have included uncomfortable surgery to retrieve sperm directly from a patient’s testes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000f3b6n1f32g6kj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A part of the testes gets removed and broken into little pieces, and you try to find sperm there,” Williams said. “It’s invasive. You can only do it a couple of times before there could be permanent scarring and damage to the testes, and it’s painful.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000g3b6nlayijq6r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other treatment options may include prescription hormone medications – but that will be effective only if the person has an imbalance of hormones. If no other treatment options are successful, couples may use donor sperm to have a child.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000h3b6nfazdmddn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Williams said the STAR method can be a new option.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000r3b6nzmr8x1iz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It really was a team effort to develop this, and that’s what really drove and motivated everybody, the fact that you can now help couples who otherwise couldn’t have that opportunity,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmd0ojx001k3b6nboa02uji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the method is currently available only at the Columbia University Fertility Center, Williams and his colleagues want to publish their work and share it with other fertility centers. Using the STAR method to find, isolate and freeze sperm for a patient would cost a little under $3,000 total, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000s3b6n77914d6x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Infertility is unique in a way in that it’s such an ancient part of the human experience. It’s literally biblical. It’s something we’ve had to contend with through all of human history,” he said. “It’s amazing to think that the most advanced technologies that we currently have are being used to solve this really ancient problem.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo000u3b6nqagmocpi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not the first time doctors have turned to AI to help men with azoospermia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo000v3b6nb4j8uy2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A separate &lt;a href="https://www.med.ubc.ca/news/could-ai-and-lab-grown-sperm-solve-male-infertility/" target="_blank"&gt;research team in Canada built an AI model&lt;/a&gt; that could automate and accelerate the process of searching for rare sperm in samples from men with the condition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo000w3b6nvrjhuvqr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The reason AI is so well-suited for this is AI really relies on learning – showing it an image of what a sperm looks like, what the shape is, what characteristics it should have – and then being able to use that learning algorithm to help identify that specific image that you’re looking for,” said Dr. Sevann Helo, a urologist at Mayo Clinic with specialty interest in male infertility and male sexual dysfunction, who was not involved in the STAR method or the research in Canada.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo000x3b6n6g3k9zc2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s very exciting,” she said. “AI, in general, at least in the medical community, I think is a whole new landscape and really will revolutionize the way we look at a lot of problems in medicine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo000y3b6nreexycws@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The STAR method is a novel approach to identifying sperm, but AI has been used in many other ways within fertility medicine too, said Dr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, a San Francisco-based reproductive endocrinologist and host of the podcast “The Egg Whisperer Show.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo000z3b6nhoja2dm4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “AI is helping us see what our eyes can’t,” Eyvazzadeh, who was not involved in the development of STAR, wrote in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmd8au2001n3b6n70uul4j5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For instance, AI algorithms, such as one called &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36543475/" target="_blank"&gt;Stork-A&lt;/a&gt;, have been used to analyze early-stage embryos and predict with “surprising accuracy” which ones are likely to be healthy. Another AI tool, &lt;a href="https://fairtility.com/chloe-oq-for-egg-freezing/" target="_blank"&gt;CHLOE&lt;/a&gt;, can assess the quality of a woman’s eggs before she may freeze them for future use.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo00103b6nwywzue4g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “AI is being used to &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-024-69165-1)&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjacqueline.howard%40cnn.com%7C57301b9705d140e3eea608ddb863de2d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638869461590674962%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=WfIPNAt%2BkdC3VLsu8oCloN1BLlfIetvapZnKGcDGRI8%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;personalize IVF medication protocols&lt;/a&gt;, making cycles more efficient and less of a guessing game. It’s also helping with sperm selection, identifying the healthiest sperm even in difficult samples. And AI can now even predict IVF success rates with more precision than ever before, using massive data sets to give patients personalized guidance,” Eyvazzadeh said. “The common thread? Better decisions, more confidence, and a more compassionate experience for patients.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo00113b6nosmdqou5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new STAR system is “a game-changer,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo00123b6nbahldhut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “AI isn’t creating sperm – it’s helping us find the rare, viable ones that are already there but nearly invisible,” she said. “It’s a breakthrough not because it replaces human expertise, but because it amplifies it – and that’s the future of fertility care.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo00133b6n259x5wq6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But there is also a growing concern that the rushed application of AI in reproductive medicine could give false hope to patients, said Dr. Gianpiero Palermo, professor of embryology and director of andrology and assisted fertilization at Weill Cornell Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo00143b6n7vkza32k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “AI is gaining a lot of traction nowadays to offer unbiased evaluation on embryos by looking at embryo morphology,” Palermo said in an email. “However, current available models are still somewhat inconsistent and require additional validation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo00153b6nlg6c7r0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Palermo said the STAR approach needs to be validated and would still require human embryologists to pick up sperm and inject them into an egg to create an embryo for patients undergoing IVF.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm5nlno00003b6mtrtqj5v0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Maybe the AI addition may help to retrieve the spermatozoon a little faster and maybe one more than the embryologist,” said Palermo, who was not involved in the development of STAR but was the first to describe the method of injecting sperm directly into an egg. Since he &lt;a href="https://weillcornell.org/gianpiero-palermo-md" target="_blank"&gt;pioneered that method&lt;/a&gt;, it has become the most-utilized assisted reproductive technology in the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo00163b6nmy8typeo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In my opinion, this approach is faulty because inevitably some men will have no spermatozoa,” Palermo said of the STAR method, “doesn’t matter how their specimens are screened whether by humans or a machine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Nationwide, such deaths increased nearly 9% annually between 2018 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In Wisconsin, deaths from cirrhosis of the liver — one of several liver diseases tied to alcohol consumption — rose 35% between 2019 and 2023, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/media/2017/06/23/WisPub/LakeCountry/636338180534634540-JCPG-LCR-BREW-FEST-5476-28407669.JPG?width=660&amp;amp;height=428&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/media/2017/06/23/WisPub/LakeCountry/636338180534634540-JCPG-LCR-BREW-FEST-5476-28407669.JPG?width=1320&amp;amp;height=856&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Wisconsin has long enjoyed a reputation for enjoying alcohol, but lately deaths from cirrhosis of the liver have risen dramatically, and among younger people."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Wisconsin has long enjoyed a reputation for enjoying alcohol, but lately deaths from cirrhosis of the liver have risen dramatically, and among younger people." data-c-credit="Scott Ash/Now Media Group"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It's well-documented that Americans &lt;a href="https://news.keckmedicine.org/pandemic-era-increase-in-alcohol-use-persists/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;began drinking more during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, and coupled with Wisconsin's deeply entrenched drinking culture, experts worry about the toll they're seeing on people's physical health. Alcohol-related deaths generally, which include myriad other causes besides liver problems, &lt;a href="/story/news/health/2025/01/10/wisconsins-alcohol-related-deaths-more-than-tripled-since-1999/77575822007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;increased three-fold in Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; between 1999 and 2020, a January analysis from the Journal Sentinel found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But experts say multidisciplinary treatment, reduced stigma around alcohol use disorder, and a renewed emphasis on education and prevention could improve the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I think the narrative often in Wisconsin is just, 'Oh, we're just big drinkers,' and that's all there is," said Maureen Busalacchi, director of the Wisconsin Alcohol Policy Project at the Medical College of Wisconsin. "The message is not that you can't drink at all. It's more, really think about it, and just drink less."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How does excessive alcohol consumption affect the liver?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/alcohol/info" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for alcohol urge people of drinking age to limit consumption to one drink or fewer per day for women and two drinks or fewer per day for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When people consume significant amounts of alcohol over a prolonged period of time, fat begins to turn up in the liver, and then scar tissue, which can lead to cirrhosis, said Dr. Rita German, a transplant hepatologist at UW Health in Madison. Many times, German said, liver disease symptoms such as jaundice, fever and confusion don't show themselves until the disease has progressed, making it harder to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;What does the data show?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Nearly 3,000 Wisconsinites died from alcohol-related liver diseases from 2019 to 2023, CDC data show. The large majority — 2,072 — were from cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Deaths from most types of liver diseases due to alcohol consumption increased in those years, including alcoholic fatty liver and alcoholic hepatic failure in addition to cirrhosis. Deaths from alcoholic hepatitis fell slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Busalacchi called the numbers a huge concern. Most of these deaths are preventable, she contended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Why are these diseases showing up in younger adults?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Doctors used to think of alcohol-related liver diseases as affecting people past middle age, German said. But increasingly, that age is dropping. At UW Health's &lt;a href="https://www.uwhealth.org/locations/digestive-health-center-254/digestive-health-center-alcohol-related-liver-disease-and-alcohol-use-disorder-clinic" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;multidisciplinary clinic&lt;/a&gt; for patients with such diseases, she said, the average age is now 45, and she's treated some as young as 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That may seem to conflict with recent research showing young people, &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-gen-z-is-drinking-less" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;particularly Gen Z, drinking less&lt;/a&gt;. But while some are cutting back, those who do drink are drinking more heavily, Busalacchi said. And while alcohol use among Wisconsin high schoolers has generally decreased in recent years, more than one in 10 reported binge drinking in the last 30 days on the state's &lt;a href="https://dpi.wi.gov/sites/default/files/imce/sspw/pdf/WI_2023_YRBS_Summary.pdf" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;most recent Youth Risk Behavior Survey, done in 2023.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The JAMA study noted, in particular, increases in alcohol-related liver disease deaths among adults ages 25-44. Deaths among women also increased disproportionately. Women absorb more alcohol into their bloodstream because they're generally smaller than men and because women's bodies have &lt;a href="https://adp.sa.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2021-05/alcohol_-_genderdifferences.pdf" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;less gastric alcohol dehydrogenase&lt;/a&gt;, the enzyme that breaks down alcohol in the stomach, German said. Thus, they're at greater risk for liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Medical College of Wisconsin's liver transplant team reports younger and younger women needing transplants due to alcohol consumption, Busalacchi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How could Wisconsin turn the tide?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;To catch alcohol-related liver diseases earlier, German said, it's critical that patients be forthcoming about their alcohol use at the doctor's office. And for that to happen, she said, doctors must view alcohol use disorder for what it is — a disease, not a personal failing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People who are concerned about their alcohol consumption may also request an ultrasound of their liver, German said. From there, they can begin treatment if need be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She also sees the benefits in treatment that is comprehensive. At UW Health's clinic, patients not only see doctors like German who attend to the liver, but addiction specialists and counselors to treat underlying mental health conditions that can drive alcohol use.

She sees encouraging signs around the state from communities that are offering more education about the consequences of excessive drinking, especially for youth.

   &lt;p&gt;By all measurements, Judy Freeman, age 76, is in fantastic health. She doesn't have diabetes or heart disease. She's not overweight. She stays active.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I try to walk at least four or five times a week," says Freeman, who's a well-known potter in Alpine, Texas. "I also work about 20 hours in the studio." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But in the past year or so, Freeman hasn't felt like herself. She's been more tired and sluggish. And she has had more trouble shedding a little extra weight. "I try and I can't lose it," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So Freeman decided to experiment with a new technology for a few weeks: a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5418465/blood-sugar-glucose-monitor-metabolic-health" target="_blank"&gt;continuous glucose monitor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;It's a small patch that inserts a needle into your skin. The device estimates your blood sugar every few minutes and sends the value to an app on your phone. You can track how various foods you eat alter your blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Freeman wondered if the extra information about her blood sugar might give her insight into why she felt so sluggish and stuck in her weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-75283" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Judy Freeman is an artist in Alpine, Texas. She wanted to know if monitoring her blood sugar could improve her health.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;On the first day, she uncovered a big clue: About two hours after lunch, her blood sugar nosedived below her baseline levels.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Dips trigger overeating&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Studies &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38363342/" target="_blank"&gt;have shown conclusively&lt;/a&gt; that these monitors greatly help&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6712232/" target="_blank"&gt; people manage diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. But in 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-over-counter-continuous-glucose-monitor" target="_blank"&gt;the FDA approved &lt;/a&gt;the first continuous glucose monitors for people without diabetes. Now, two companies, Dexcom and Abbott, sell and market the devices to anyone who wants to track their blood sugar. They cost about $50 and last for a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But scientists are still trying to figure out if — and how — these monitors could help people without diabetes. Can the data motivate people to eat a healthier diet by helping them learn how food affects their bodies?&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;One of the scientists leading this effort is &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/sarah-berry" target="_blank"&gt;Sarah Berry, a nutritionist &lt;/a&gt;at King's College London. She's also chief scientist at the &lt;a href="https://zoe.com/en-us" target="_blank"&gt;company Zoe&lt;/a&gt;, which sells personalized nutrition plans that incorporate these devices.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital and Stanford University, Berry and her colleagues led two&lt;a href="https://zoe.com/our-studies" target="_blank"&gt; large studies&lt;/a&gt; in which thousands of people without diabetes wear continuous glucose monitors while they eat tens of thousands of meals.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After analyzing all of their data, Berry says one finding stands out: "A big proportion of people are what we call dippers," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;If you're a dipper, your blood sugar sometimes acts in a specific way: After eating carbohydrates, it rises quickly, and then about two to three hours later, it sometimes plummets low, below your baseline, or fasting, level.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So you'll have this big increase followed by this big crash," Berry says. "Not everyone gets these dips, but we see that quite a high proportion of people do."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These dips can trigger overeating, their study found, so it may make it harder to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you are dipping, then you feel &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/10/30/1208883691/diet-ozempic-wegovy-weight-loss-fiber-glp-1-diabetes-barley" target="_blank"&gt;more hungry more quickly&lt;/a&gt;, and on average you tend to eat 80 calories more at the next meal and 320 calories more over a whole day," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But eating more wasn't the only problem with dips. Berry's team has found that the sugar crashes also correlated with a person's mood. During a dip, people tended to feel less alert and more fatigued, she and her colleagues &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-021-00383-x" target="_blank"&gt;reported in the journal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These conclusions line up with previous studies on people with diabetes, says &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/dalia-perelman" target="_blank"&gt;Dalia Perelman&lt;/a&gt;, who's a research dietitian at Stanford University and wasn't involved in this research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When your blood sugar is high, people tend to be lethargic, fatigued, and thirsty," Perelman says. "You're just like, ugh."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When your blood sugar is low, you're jittery. You can have heart palpitations. And you become super hungry. "Low blood sugar gives your body very strong signals," she says. "You really feel terrible,"  which brings us back to Judy Freeman in Alpine, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first day Freeman wore the glucose monitor, she ate lunch as usual. About two hours later, she started to feel horrible. "I had this really sinking feeling. It was a sort of anxiety or depression. I felt like if I don't get up, I'm just going to stop breathing and die. It was so overpowering," Freeman says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;When Freeman glanced at the monitor, she could hardly believe what she saw: "My blood sugar had shot up at some point, and then it plummeted down to the lowest point."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This sinking feeling wasn't new to Freeman. She's had it from time to time. "I just never, ever thought it was in any way correlated with what I ate or anything like that.&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you are concerned that your blood sugar may be fluctuating wildly and you want to even things out, here are three things you can try:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;1. Put some clothes on those carbs&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Don't eat meals and snacks that consist mostly of carbohydrates, Perelman says. "Don't eat naked carbs."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Instead, eat them with protein and healthy fats. That means oils from vegetables, seeds and nuts, but also fats from fish. So add eggs to breakfast, canned fish for lunch or tofu for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;On top of that,&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/09/19/1196977677/easy-ways-to-add-more-fiber-to-your-diet" target="_blank"&gt; add more fiber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— &lt;em&gt;lots more.&lt;/em&gt; For that, the go-to ingredient is beans, says &lt;a href="https://twu.edu/faculty-profiles/college-of-health-sciences/mindy-a-patterson-phd-rdn/" target="_blank"&gt;nutritionist Mindy Patterson&lt;/a&gt; at the Texas Woman's University. "You really have to eat beans to get enough fiber in your diet," she says. (Chia seeds are another great source of fiber.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Fiber and protein together&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/10/30/1208883691/diet-ozempic-wegovy-weight-loss-fiber-glp-1-diabetes-barley" target="_blank"&gt; put a speed bump &lt;/a&gt;on your digestion," says clinical &lt;a href="https://www.realfood-matters.net/" target="_blank"&gt;nutritionist Karen Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;. "They really stabilize your blood sugar."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;2. Sprinkle the carbs throughout the day&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To prevent dips, you want your gut to slowly drip carbs into your blood, not douse it with a deluge of sugars, Perelman says. So don't eat a bunch of carbohydrates all at one meal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For preventing dips, "it doesn't matter how many carbs you ate throughout the day," she says. "It matters how many carbs you've had at each meal."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;3. Pay attention to what you eat first at a meal&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;With food, order matters, too. Eat the protein, fiber and fat &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; at a meal and the carbs &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt;, Kennedy says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Say you're having a steak, salad and baked potato for dinner. "If you eat the salad and the steak first, and then the potato, you'll see that you don't have as much of a spike in blood sugar or as much of a drop afterwards," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If your blood sugar keeps a more even keel, then your mood and hunger will do the same.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And here's the great part: You don't need to buy a glucose monitor to figure this out, says Sarah Berry at King's College London. Simply pay attention to how you feel about two hours after a meal. If you get moody, anxious or super hungry, you're probably a dipper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Alarming projections by the National Cancer Institute estimate that in 2025 alone, there will be 313,780 new cases of prostate cancer—accounting for 15.4% of all new cancer diagnoses in men—and approximately 35,770 deaths, representing 5.8% of all cancer-related fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These figures aren’t just numbers, they're a wake-up call. They point up the pressing need to raise awareness, enhance early detection, and prioritise treatment strategies for a disease that begins in the prostate—a small but vital gland in the male reproductive system. As the global burden of prostate cancer continues to rise, understanding its implications is no longer optional as it’s essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is prostate cancer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prostate is a small but essential gland in the male reproductive system, located just below the bladder and above the pelvic muscles. About the size of a chestnut, it weighs approximately 30 grams and plays a crucial role in producing the fluid that forms a key component of semen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer arises when cells grow uncontrollably, disrupting the body’s normal functioning. Prostate cancer, similarly, develops when cells in the prostate gland begin to multiply in an unregulated and abnormal manner, potentially leading to serious health complications if not detected and treated early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is &lt;keyword id="27604823" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="early-stage-prostate-cancer" source="keywords"&gt;early-stage prostate cancer&lt;/keyword&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staging of cancer Staging describes or classifies a cancer based on how much cancer there is in the body and where it is when first diagnosed. When prostate cancer cells remain confined to the gland itself—or have only slightly extended beyond it without spreading to distant parts of the body—the condition is referred to as localised prostate cancer. However, once the cancer spreads beyond nearby tissues, it progresses into what's commonly called advanced prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under TNN system given by AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer, Prostate cancer is generally classified into four stages by :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early Stage (Stages I &amp;amp; II): The tumor is limited to the prostate and hasn’t spread elsewhere. This is also known as “localized prostate cancer” and is often more responsive to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Locally Advanced (Stage III): The cancer has begun to grow beyond the prostate, invading nearby tissues such as the seminal vesicles, but has not reached distant organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced or Metastatic (Stage IV): The cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, such as the bones, liver, or lungs. This stage is more challenging to treat and is commonly referred to as advanced prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="26911286" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="symptoms-of-prostate-cancer" source="keywords"&gt;Symptoms of prostate cancer&lt;/keyword&gt;: Warning signs to watch for&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most cases, prostate cancer does not provide noticeable symptoms in its early stages. But, when signs do appear, they may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood in the urine&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood in the semen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frequent urge to urinate, especially at night&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain or burning sensation during urination&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Erectile dysfunction&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dull, persistent pain in the lower pelvic area&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loss of appetite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Painful ejaculation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bone pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discomfort or pain in the lower back, hips, or upper thighs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What causes prostate cancer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact cause of prostate cancer remains unknown. While medical professionals haven’t deciphered the exact causes behind the same, several risk factors have been identified by them that may increase the potential of developing prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Major Risk Factors:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age: Risk of prostate cancer is directly proportional to the age of a man, it rises majorly after age 50. The prostate naturally enlarges with age, increasing vulnerability (American Cancer Society).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family History: According to the American Cancer Society, “Having a father or brother with prostate cancer more than doubles a man’s risk of developing this disease. (The risk is higher for men who have a brother with the disease than for those who have a father with it.)

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating a protein-rich diet can have several health benefits. If you struggle to get enough protein to meet your body’s needs, incorporating high-protein foods into snacks can help you reach your protein goal. We spoke with registered dietitians to find out why protein is so important—plus, which high-protein foods should make it into your snack rotation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-benefits-of-eating-protein-rich-snacks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Benefits of Eating Protein-Rich Snacks &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein is an essential macronutrient that is important for health and well-being. “Protein plays a key role in the body’s ability to build muscle, repair tissue, regulate hormones and perform other cellular functions like metabolism,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cayleigh-mckenna-rd-ldn-81b7551a8/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cayleigh McKenna, RD&lt;/a&gt;, nutrition consultant at Houston Family Nutrition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because protein is essential for building and maintaining muscle, physically active people should emphasize protein in their meals and snacks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding protein to snacks can offer several benefits, including long-lasting energy and increased satiety. “Protein-rich snacks can help you feel fuller for longer, promoting a sense of nourishment and satisfaction,” says &lt;a href="https://www.honesthealthandwellness.com/#about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Andrea Hinojosa, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Honest Health &amp;amp; Wellness. “Many high-protein snacks are also rich in other essential nutrients, contributing to overall health and well-being,” she adds. Eating protein with snacks may also balance blood sugar, improve heart health and reduce cravings later in the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-best-high-protein-foods-to-eat-as-snacks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Best High-Protein Foods to Eat as Snacks &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-greek-yogurt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Greek Yogurt  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-square figure-high-res"&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Creamy and refreshing, “Greek yogurt is high in protein and can be easily paired with honey and nuts for added flavor and texture,” says Hinojosa. Depending on the brand, you’ll snag about 20 grams of protein per 7-ounce serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
You can also use &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8015607/greek-yogurt-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; in place of sour cream and mayonnaise in dip recipes for a high-protein swap that’s lower in saturated fat. Strained Greek-style yogurt is also a great way to add protein to fruit smoothies. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-square figure-high-res"&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One egg provides a satisfying 6 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “They’re portable, easy to prepare and packed with high-quality protein,” says Hinojosa. Enjoy hard-boiled eggs with a handful of nuts or top with hot sauce. Hinojosa also recommends pairing eggs with kimchi to add digestive-friendly &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8037462/benefits-of-taking-probiotics/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt; and a spicy kick.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-canned-tuna-or-salmon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Canned Tuna or Salmon &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-square figure-high-res"&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned fish is a quick high-protein option for snacks. You can even purchase “canned” fish in travel-friendly pouches, making them the perfect protein-rich snack when you’re on the go. Canned salmon has about 18 grams of protein per 3-ounce serving, while canned tuna has about 22 grams per serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “They also provide omega-3 fatty acids, beneficial for heart health and brain function,” adds Hinojosa.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/267208/tuna-salad-spread/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Tuna Salad Spread&lt;/a&gt;, which combines canned tuna and Greek yogurt for a protein-packed snack. Spread it on whole-grain crackers or toast, or use raw veggies for dipping. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-string-cheese"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. String Cheese  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-square figure-high-res"&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another portable and easy option for snacking is string cheese. One stick has about 8 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “For high-protein snacks, I love a turkey and cheese roll-up. I use a cheese stick and two slices of deli turkey or chicken and roll it up together. It’s really satisfying,” says &lt;a href="http://linkedin.com/in/katie-d-78a88838" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Katie Drakeford, M.A., RD&lt;/a&gt;, owner of Drakeford Consulting. You can also enjoy string cheese with fresh fruit or a side of nuts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-jerky"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Jerky &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-square figure-high-res"&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Jerky is a great high-protein snack option—and it’s especially handy if you can’t keep things cold. One serving of beef jerky (about 1 ounce) provides about 10 grams of protein, while turkey jerky has 11 grams per serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Enjoy jerky with fresh fruit like an apple or banana, or with a handful of trail mix for an added boost of healthy fats. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Deli turkey is another high-protein snack option. Just one slice of deli turkey has 6 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Enjoy a couple of slices on crackers, layer a few slices with cheese on top of cucumber slices or make a grown-up snack box with turkey, cheese, grapes and crackers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Until it became a social media darling, who knew there were so many ways to incorporate &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8047423/best-cottage-cheese-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt; into meals and snacks? And it’s worth it to do so: 1 cup of low-fat cottage cheese has about 24 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “A cup of cottage cheese with berries or pineapple is another go-to when looking to up protein intake,” says Drakeford. If you prefer a savory snack, try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8078448/cottage-cheese-snack-jar/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Cottage Cheese Snack Jar&lt;/a&gt;.

			&lt;p&gt;Simply using your food packaging in the manner it's supposed to be used is enough to contaminate your comestibles with a sprinkling of microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A painstaking review of 103 scientific studies on microplastic food contamination found actions as simple as opening a plastic drink bottle or using a plastic chopping board can shave off tiny particles of common polymers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even glass bottles that use a plastic gasket, plastic-lined pizza boxes, plastic-lined disposable  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="166048" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; cups, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-single-tea-bag-could-release-billions-of-microplastics-into-the-body"&gt;plastic tea bags&lt;/a&gt;, plastic wrappings, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microwaving-safe-plastics-can-release-billions-of-particles-scientists-warn"&gt;microwaveable plastic containers&lt;/a&gt; shed microplastic like a Persian cat sheds fur in spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem, a team led by biologist Lisa Zimmermann of the non-profit Food Packaging Forum in Switzerland says, is ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-could-accumulate-in-our-brains-more-than-in-kidneys-and-livers?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Microplastics Could Accumulate in Our Brains More Than in Kidneys And Livers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first systematic evidence of how normal and intended use of foodstuffs packaged in plastics can be contaminated with micro- and nanoplastics," &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/24/health/microplastics-food-packaging-study-wellness"&gt;Zimmermann told CNN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found food packaging is actually a direct source of the micro- and nanoplastics measured in food."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more scientists look into micro- and nanoplastics, or MNPs, the more we see just how widespread they have become. These are tiny pieces of material, too small to see, released by a variety of polymers as they're used or break up in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic is ubiquitous in our modern society, providing a cheap, easily manufactured solution to everything from storage to clothing to furnishings. In recent decades it has become clear its resistance to degrading doesn't mean it is impervious to crumbling into smaller fragments, which easily filter through ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have found microplastics throughout the human body, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-found-in-every-human-placenta-tested-study-finds"&gt;including placentas&lt;/a&gt;. It's been found in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-infiltrate-every-organ-including-brain-study-in-mice-shows"&gt;every major organ in mice&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-absorbed-by-fetus-persist-after-birth-study-in-mice-finds"&gt;their fetuses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this even more worrying is that we just have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/toxicologists-urge-for-research-into-the-unknown-health-risks-of-microplastic"&gt;very little idea about the health impacts&lt;/a&gt;, although it's not looking promising: A study last year found that cardiac and stroke  patients with a high concentration of microplastics in their carotid artery plaque &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822"&gt;had a significantly elevated risk of death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zimmermann and her colleagues examined 103 studies that have investigated the presence of plastic particles in food and food simulants. From these studies, they extracted 600 entries about food contact articles, of which 96 percent reported the presence of MNPs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those entries were also compiled into a searchable and filterable &lt;a href="https://foodpackagingforum.org/resources/databases/mino"&gt;dashboard that anyone can access&lt;/a&gt;, allowing users to home in on different types of food contact articles, from packaging to baby bottles, as well as different types of plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/glass-bottles-actually-contain-more-microplastics-scientists-find?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Glass Bottles Actually Contain More Microplastics, Scientists Find&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of particular note, the researchers found, is that multiple studies found that for some reusable plastic items, such as melamine bowls, the amount of microplastics shed increased with each wash. This suggests that repeated heating and abrasion increases the rate at which these items degrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also note that ultra-processed food contains more microplastic than minimally processed food. The reason for this is simple: more processing steps mean greater exposure to plastic food-processing equipment, resulting in more MNPs in the final product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings, the researchers say, strongly indicate that not only is a lot more research warranted, but also that more needs to be done to minimize the use of plastics in food packaging and preparation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study shows that under intended or foreseeable conditions of use, plastic food contact articles can release MNPs into foodstuffs," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41538-025-00470-3"&gt;they write in their paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The contribution of plastic food contact articles to human MNP exposure is currently unclear and warrants further investigation. Further research is also necessary to establish human health impacts associated with MNP exposures, but a precautionary approach aimed at limiting human exposure to MNPs, including from food contact articles, is prudent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://foodpackagingforum.org/resources/databases/mino"&gt;access the interactive dashboard here&lt;/a&gt;, and the paper has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41538-025-00470-3"&gt;&lt;i&gt;npj Science of Food&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Late-night snacks can support weight loss—what matters most is choosing balanced, nutrient-dense options.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A top pick is cottage cheese with fruit and nuts, offering protein, fiber, healthy fats, and sleep support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aim for snacks with under 200 calories, over 7 grams of protein, and fiber to keep you full and satisfied.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may have heard that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292223/these-are-the-worst-foods-to-have-before-going-to-bed/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating before bed&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;no-no&lt;/em&gt; if weight loss is a goal. However, that couldn’t be further from the truth. And, there’s science to prove it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A small snack can benefit cardiovascular and metabolic health, as well as promote muscle protein synthesis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You don’t have to avoid snacking at night. And that advice stands if you’re aiming to lose weight. It's the quality of your snack that matters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So when you’re looking for a late-night bite, read on. We talked to registered dietitians about what late night snack they’d choose to support weight loss.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dig into this creamy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cottage-cheese-snack-jar-with-fruit-8411316" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cottage Cheese Snack Jar with Fruit&lt;/a&gt; when hunger strikes at night.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you haven’t embraced the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8056073/cottage-cheese-mustard-dip-trend-gone-too-far/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cottage cheese craze&lt;/a&gt;, here’s your opportunity. The best late-night snack for weight loss that dietitians swear by is the trendy staple that has social media buzzing. This recipe for a cottage cheese snack jar adds diced peaches and chopped pecans for a sweet and crunchy snack.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Cottage cheese and fruit is an amazing and delicious late-night snack,” says &lt;a href="https://nutritionstarringyou.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Nutrition Starring You and author of &lt;em&gt;The Everything Easy Pre-Diabetes Cookbook&lt;/em&gt;. “The slow-digesting protein, fiber from the fruit and unsaturated fats from a sprinkle of nuts is a fabulous combo to help balance blood sugar, feed your muscles while you sleep and provide an antioxidant boost,” she explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s more about why this snack staple is such a superhero before bed.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Contains Sleep-Promoting Tryptophan &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just like turkey on Thanksgiving, dairy foods are a great way to up your intake of tryptophan, says registered dietitian and certified personal trainer &lt;a href="https://enjoyfoodenjoylife.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nicole Rodriguez, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. Tryptophan is a naturally occurring amino acid that plays an important role in the production of serotonin and sleep-regulating &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-melatonin-8663994" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;melatonin&lt;/a&gt; for sleep. Thanks to this and other amino acids found in dairy, foods like cottage cheese may help support sleep quality.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s High in Protein  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dairy is a powerhouse when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-protein-foods-to-eat-as-snacks-8674784" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-quality protein&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it contains a complete package of essential amino acids. A ½-cup serving of 1% fat cottage cheese provides 14 grams of protein for just 80 calories and 1 gram of total fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, research shows that pre-sleep protein, specifically casein, can help your body build muscle when you are engaged in a strength training program.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This supports earlier research that suggested that higher-protein diets may also help with appetite and weight management.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Choosing a low-fat dairy food like cottage cheese is a great way to add a solid source of protein into your nighttime routine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Packed with Vitamins and Minerals &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cottage cheese contains calcium, magnesium, zinc and B vitamins.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Magnesium and zinc, in particular, play an important supporting role in helping convert tryptophan in dairy foods into melatonin (that circadian rhythm-regulating good sleep hormone).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One caveat when it comes to cottage cheese is its sodium content. Traditional cottage cheese is rather high in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7882895/easy-ways-to-cut-sodium-in-your-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sodium&lt;/a&gt;, with a ½-cup serving clocking in at 459 milligrams, 20% of the recommended daily limit.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you are trying to reduce the sodium in your diet, choose a no-salt-added cottage cheese or compare the sodium content between brands and pick a lower-salt product.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Has Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While cottage cheese on its own lacks fiber, the addition of fruits and nuts gives it a nice fiber boost. This recipe supplies 3 grams of fiber. Plus, when some of that fiber comes from fruit, you’re in luck. “The addition of fruit can satisfy sweet cravings that you may be trying to minimize while pursuing a weight-loss goal,” says Rodriguez.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Has Fat  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Healthy fat sources contribute to snack satiety and satisfaction, says Rodriguez. The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cottage-cheese-snack-jar-with-fruit-8411316" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cottage Cheese Snack Jar with Fruit&lt;/a&gt; has 2 tablespoons of chopped pecans, though you can change up the nuts if you’d like. Other ideas include slivered almonds, walnut pieces or chopped pistachios.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-consider-when-choosing-a-late-night-snack"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Consider When Choosing a Late-Night Snack &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Late-night snacks do not have to involve heading to the pantry to grab potato chips or cookies. (Classic TV munchies, of course.) Those snacks taste good, but there are better choices that align with weight loss. “While I encourage my patients to embrace an ‘all foods fit’ philosophy, nighttime presents its own challenges,” says Rodriguez. For example, eating spicy, fatty or fried foods can cause indigestion, while foods with a lot of added sugars can cause blood glucose spikes. Both of these can disrupt your sleep, and lack of sleep can affect your appetite and may make weight loss more difficult.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But there are two nutrients you should focus on when it comes to nighttime nibbles: protein and fiber, says Harris-Pincus. These provide staying power, she says. “Sticking with these options will help to keep blood sugar levels more stable and offer an opportunity to maximize your nutrient intake for the day.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here are the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/our-food-and-nutrition-philosophy-6746110" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrition parameters&lt;/a&gt; to focus on when finding a late-night snack:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calories:&lt;/strong&gt; Aim for roughly 200 calories per snack, depending on your personal energy needs, to avoid feeling overly full before bed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure your snack choice has protein. Aiming for 7 or more grams provides a good source of protein. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; Fiber helps keep you fuller for longer, and can also support your weight-loss goals through offering satiety, meaning you’re less likely to mindlessly munch. Aim for a snack that provides some fiber, ideally 3 or more grams. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fat:&lt;/strong&gt; Fat is your friend; it also helps to satiate you. Choose a snack that packs a little bit of unsaturated fat to help provide that staying power until your morning meal. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can enjoy a late-night snack, even if weight loss is on your radar. Consider your individual calorie, protein and nutrient needs as you explore what foods will satisfy you as well. Dietitians recommend pairing low-fat cottage cheese with fruit and nuts for a late-night option that provides protein, fat and fiber, all nutrients that support weight-loss goals.
