from cola gummies to "icy blue razz" powders that are mixed with a drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Creatine is a compound naturally produced by the body and also found in animal-based products like fish and meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;It's found in most muscles in the body, as well as the brain, and used as a source of energy to allow muscles to flex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Our bodies make around half the creatine we need each day (about 2 to 4 grams) but the rest has to come from the food we eat or supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="ContentAlignment_marginBottom__4H_6E ContentAlignment_overflowAuto__c1_IL ContentAlignment_outdentDesktop__ijbiK Figure_figure__xLyBy Figure_docImage__DSvk4" data-print="inline-media" data-component="Figure" id="105655166" data-uri="coremedia://imageproxy/105655166"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="Figure_caption__fS2lN"&gt;&lt;p class="Typography_base__sj2RP FigureCaption_text__zDxQ5 Typography_sizeMobile12__w_FPC Typography_lineHeightMobile20___U7Vr Typography_regular__WeIG6 Typography_colourInherit__dfnUx" data-component="Typography"&gt;Almost all scientific studies have been on creatine monohydrate and experts warn against other formulations.  &lt;cite&gt;(&lt;span&gt;ABC News: Paige Cockburn&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Creatine is one of the most studied supplements and there is extensive evidence it can support muscle growth and improve athletic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Emerging research shows it might even help our brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;But some experts are urging consumers to do some research before they buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;"There's this messaging at the moment that everyone should take creatine supplements no matter who they are and what they're doing, and I really disagree with that," Ms Richardson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Some brands are selling "premium" types of creatine that don't have adequate scientific backing but customers are paying more for them, according to experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;"Just remember these supplement companies have really good marketing teams," said Professor Matthew Cooke, a nutritionist at La Trobe University, who has done extensive research on creatine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;There's also "femvertising" of some products with pretty, pink packaging, collagen add-ins and female-centric marketing, with one US brand even calling themselves "Sheatine".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Then there's the gummies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="Typography_base__sj2RP Heading_heading__VGa5B future_heading__Gcudw Heading_default__Z3p_p Typography_sizeMobile20__NUDn4 Typography_sizeDesktop32__LR_G6 Typography_lineHeightMobile24__crkfh Typography_lineHeightDesktop40__BuoRf Typography_marginBottomMobileSmall__6wx7m Typography_marginBottomDesktopSmall__CboX4 Typography_bold__FqafP Typography_colourInherit__dfnUx Typography_normalise__u5o1s" data-component="Heading"&gt;'Expensive lollies'?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="ContentAlignment_marginBottom__4H_6E ContentAlignment_overflowAuto__c1_IL ContentAlignment_outdentDesktop__ijbiK Figure_figure__xLyBy Figure_docImage__DSvk4" data-print="inline-media" data-component="Figure" id="105655006" data-uri="coremedia://imageproxy/105655006"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="Figure_caption__fS2lN"&gt;&lt;p class="Typography_base__sj2RP FigureCaption_text__zDxQ5 Typography_sizeMobile12__w_FPC Typography_lineHeightMobile20___U7Vr Typography_regular__WeIG6 Typography_colourInherit__dfnUx" data-component="Typography"&gt;PUSH has apologised to customers for selling gummies that contained almost no creatine. &lt;cite&gt;(&lt;span&gt;Supplied: PUSH&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Creatine gummies are advertised as a delicious and easy-to-take option but independent testing has repeatedly shown some contain almost zero creatine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;One popular brand sold in Australia called PUSH was forced to halt all sales after testing showed their gummies were significantly underdosed with creatine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;&lt;a class="Link_link__5eL5m ScreenReaderOnly_srLinkHint__OysWz Link_showVisited__C1Fea Link_showFocus__ALyv2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gLVOGJpSpE&amp;amp;t=13s" data-component="Link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Sydney-based personal trainer James Smith&lt;/a&gt;

Some people do this quickly by starting with a "loading" phase of 20 grams per day for a week and then lowering to 5 grams per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Loading isn't necessary though, Professor Cooke said, because you get the same results by starting at 5 grams per day, it will just take a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;For most people it will result in more power and strength for explosive bursts of exercise and it improves recovery after exercise-related muscle damage as well as sarcopenia (loss of muscle as we age) if taken in conjunction with resistance training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Recently, researchers started delving deeper into the potential benefits of creatine among women and how it might assist during hormonal fluctuations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="ContentAlignment_marginBottom__4H_6E ContentAlignment_overflowAuto__c1_IL ContentAlignment_outdentDesktop__ijbiK

Cockburn&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;During menopause, estrogen and progesterone levels decline significantly which may negatively impact creatine metabolism so supplementation could be beneficial at this time, Professor Cooke said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Research has shown creatine supplementation can help post-menopausal women with physical function when combined with resistance training and now experts want to explore how it might support bone health during perimenopause when bone density starts to decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;It's early days but research is also suggesting supplementation may benefit pre-menopausal women during their menstrual cycles when there's varying levels of creatine metabolism and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Some brands are now shamelessly trying to capture the female market by using taglines like "craft your perfect peach" or advertising "creatine for women" when it’s exactly the same as the "genderless" creatine on the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Professor Cooke said some brands may be capitalising on the recent research that's been more focused on women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;"I know some marketing will take advantage of this but in the research space it's really great to see this research in the female population."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2

been more data showing it can help with cognitive processes," Professor Antonio said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;It's worth nothing though that approximately 20 to 30 per

&lt;p&gt;Is your wallet getting as thin as your hair thanks to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/13/lifestyle/from-rogaine-to-robots-trendiest-hacks-balding-men-using-to-get-their-hair-back/"&gt;pricey pills and potions&lt;/a&gt; promising to save your strands?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You’re not alone. In the US, more than &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/most-men-experience-hair-loss-it-isnt-inevitable" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;80% of men and nearly half of women&lt;/a&gt; will face significant hair loss in their lifetime, fueling a multi-billion-dollar industry selling quick fixes that don’t always work. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But before you empty your pockets, know this: There are a few simple everyday steps that one trichologist says can help protect your hair and keep it it looking fuller.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hair loss can lead to decreased self-esteem, anxiety and even depression in some people.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Rido – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;William Gaunitz, a certified trichologist and founder of &lt;a href="https://www.advancedtrichology.com/pages/william-gaunitz-trichologist-hair-loss-expert" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Advanced Trichology&lt;/a&gt;, shared five easy, effective ways to support scalp health and fight hair loss from home.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also gave The Post a heads-up about three popular hair hacks that could actually wind up doing more harm than good. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;#1. Soak up some sunlight&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Get out in the sun for 15 minutes with no sunscreen to get a balanced amount of vitamin D3,” Gaunitz advised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is essential for creating the cells that develop into hair follicles. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34553483/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; a deficiency may contribute to issues like excessive shedding and female pattern hair loss. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But if you’re staying out longer than 15 minutes, don’t forget the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/09/health/what-to-know-about-picking-sunscreen-including-2-key-ingredients/"&gt;SPF&lt;/a&gt; — even a small amount of time under a strong UV index without protection can lead to a sunburn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Up to 40% of women will experience some degree of female pattern hair loss by age 50. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Nadya Kolobova – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;#2. Eat a balanced diet&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This one thing is more important than anything else,” Gaunitz stressed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you don’t eat animal protein or follow another special diet, he warned there’s an “extremely high” chance you’ll drain your nutrient stores unless you carefully replace them with other sources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Discover your blood type and eat accordingly,” Gaunitz recommended. “That is a great way to understand what your body needs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;William Gaunitz, a certified trichologist, has been working in the hair loss industry since 2002. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Instagram/williamgaunitztrichologist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;#3. Check your gut health&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you have any consistent problems, like constipation, diarrhea or acid reflux, it is possible that your nutrient supply absorption may have been compromised,” Gaunitz said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means your body might not be absorbing nutrients properly even if you’re eating right — and those nutrient issues can impact your whole body, including your hair.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;#4 Don’t skip shampoo days&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Wash your hair at a minimum of every 48 hours with a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/article/best-shampoos-for-every-hair-type-review/"&gt;healthy shampoo&lt;/a&gt; that has some type of antimicrobial oil in it, like grapefruit seed, rosemary, tea tree or thyme,” Gaunitz suggested.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Keeping microbial overload in check gently and consistently is key to managing your scalp’s delicate microbiome without damage, he explained. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Studies have shown that regular scalp massage can lead to reduced hair loss and increased hair thickness.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Instagram/mimada.beauty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;#5 Massage your scalp daily&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before you hit the shower, try the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoG8iygEecc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;scalp-over-skull massage technique&lt;/a&gt;. It’s believed to boost blood flow to hair follicles, break up mild calcification under the scalp and help clear out excess sebum, an oily substance crucial for hair growth that can be harmful if it builds up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This can drastically improve scalp health,” Gaunitz said. “You can also use a gua sha tool and massage the scalp with the edge, which requires less effort but is still marginally effective.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What to ditch from your routine&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some “hacks” are doing more harm than good. Gaunitz said to skip these three.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#1. Dermarolling daily.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This handheld microneedling device may seem like a quick fix, but “dermarolling at home daily is a bad idea because it can create scarring and trauma on the scalp, little micro infections, and in many cases will actually make your scalp worse,” Gaunitz warned. “Like anything, it should be done properly by a professional.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;While it’s often used to stimulate growth, incorrect or excessive derma rolling can worsen hair loss. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Mishy Skincare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#2. Skipping wash day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The number of times I’ve heard somebody say that they were told by their stylist that they saw online that you shouldn’t wash your hair, and that’s why your hair is falling out, is absurd,” Gaunitz said. “If your scalp is unhealthy, or you are shedding in any way, you need to be shampooing regularly,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sebum on your scalp harbors bacteria, fungi and other bodily excretions. Removing this buildup is crucial to preventing further inflammation, Gaunitz said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Wash your hair daily or at least every 48 hours by scrubbing the surface of your scalp,” he advised. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#3. Slathering garlic juice, onion juice or undiluted rosemary oil directly on your scalp.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Although there are benefits to each of these, applying them directly to the scalp alters the microbiome,” Gaunitz said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You should not use them on their own except with a purpose, and they should not be used undiluted.”&lt;/p&gt;

That individual was hospitalized with the condition earlier this month, the health department said, but is now recovering at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said this person was likely infected in the southern half of the county in July, near the Jordan River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus is spread to humans through bites from infected mosquitoes, and both health departments urged people to protect themselves from mosquito bites to prevent contracting the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Salt Lake County Health Department said Thursday that 108 mosquito samples have tested positive for West Nile virus this year across the state, and because mosquitoes can travel several miles, everyone near any of those areas should take precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week's report from the Utah Department of Health and Human Services said mosquitoes have been found with West Nile virus in the Bear River Health District, Davis County, Salt Lake County, TriCounty (Uintah, Dagget and Duchesne) and in Utah County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reported that the percentage of mosquito pools testing positive at this point in the year, 1.53%, is higher than the last two years — 1.41% in 2024 and 0.99% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the Utah health department reported 14 cases of West Nile virus, 12 of which were the neuroinvasive form. It reported one Utahn died from the disease in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of West Nile virus, which appear between two and 14 days after a bite, include fever, headache, rash, vomiting, body aches and diarrhea. More severe cases can lead to neurological problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Salt Lake County Health Department said many who become infected may not even know; between 20% and 30% of infected people will not have symptoms and others will have only minor symptoms. It is estimated that less than 1% of people with West Nile virus develop the neuroinvasive form, which can lead to debilitating complications or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, there are likely many more than three Utahns who have been infected this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bear River Health Department suggested protection through "the 5 Ds": Drain standing water, avoid outdoor activities at dawn and dusk, use bug spray with DEET, dress in loose, long clothing and ensure door and window screens are repaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

(That's US$2,600 and US$6,500, or £2,000 and £4,900.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'Ozempic vulva' is the latest unsightly and uncomfortable side effect being reported by women taking GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro (stock image posed by model)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The term labia puffing is a marketing term, not a formal medical one,' explains Dr Justin Perron, a specialist plastic surgeon and board member of the Australasian Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The labia majora, like other fatty areas, can lose volume after substantial weight loss.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These changes are more pronounced with rapid weight loss and in women over 35, where natural collagen and elastin reserves are already reduced,' adds Dr Perron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Effects may include deflation (a wrinkled appearance) and diminished elasticity, resulting in sagging or folds that make activities such as cycling, running or sex less comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 79,000 Australians are estimated to be using Ozempic, the GLP-1 injectable drug used both to treat diabetes and weight loss. The average patient loses an estimated 10-15 per cent of their body weight on the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While these drugs have transformed many bodies, the toll of rapid weight loss shows up from head to toe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'GLP-1 receptor agonists (semaglutide, tirzepatide) and other effective weight-loss interventions have created a new subset of patients experiencing rapid, significant weight loss,' Dr Perron says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Loss of subcutaneous fat is global – including the mons pubis and labia majora – sometimes giving the area a deflated or "aged" look. This can be due to ptosis of soft tissue, or atrophy of the fat in this area.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds that while formal registry data is limited, some ASAPS members have reported a rise in requests for vulvo-vaginal aesthetic procedures, including labia majora augmentation, over the past five to 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This parallels trends in America and Britain, where it's often bundled under "genital rejuvenation",' he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Requests for 'labia-puffing' treatments to restore volume are on the rise (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perron notes that, anecdotally, he has seen an increase in genital rejuvenation consultations as a direct result of post-weight loss changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I personally see these requests several times a week,' he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Non-surgical labia puffing requires little downtime - light activity can resume almost immediately, though sex and intense exercise are usually off-limits for up to a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Risks can include bruising, swelling, asymmetry, overcorrection, infection, filler migration and rare vascular compromise,' notes Dr Perron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surgical options - such as fat grafting or dermal fat grafts, occasionally with skin removal - require significantly greater downtime, and include risks such as 'swelling, bruising, infection, seroma, fat necrosis, oil cysts, asymmetry or partial fat loss requiring revision.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-7ff086d0-798b-11f0-b25e-05c31ac3b316" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14998721/I-Ozempic-vulva-latest-bizarre-effect-miracle-jabs-no-one-talks-theres-one-treatment-fix-it.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;READ MORE FROM DAILYMAIL+ &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;EXCLUSIVE NEWS AND FEATURES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14778367/Zoran-Vidovic-Zagi-Kozarov-Bali-hotel-death-development.html"&gt;When Zoran plunged to his death at a Bali hotel, his heartbroken fiancée begged for answers.

              &lt;p&gt;Good news, everyone! Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, have coined a new term to describe our brains being dumb. In a recent study, they provide evidence for a distinct but common kind of cognitive bias—one that makes us reluctant to take the easier path in life if it means retracing our steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers have named the bias the “doubling-back aversion.” In several experiments, they found that people often refuse to choose a more efficient solution or route if it requires them to double back on the progress already made. The findings suggest that people’s subjective fear of adding more to their workload and their hesitance to wipe the slate clean contribute to this bias, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Participants’ aversion to feeling their past efforts were a waste encouraged them to pursue less efficient means,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976251331053"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this May in Psychological Science.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Psychologists have detailed all sorts of biases related to digging our feet in when faced with important new information. People tend to stick to the status quo in choosing dinner at a favorite restaurant, for example, even when someone recommends a potentially tastier option. There’s also the sunk cost fallacy, or the reluctance to veer off a disastrous path and choose another simply because they’ve spent so much time or resources pursuing it. The researchers argue that their newly named bias is certainly a close cousin to the sunk cost fallacy and similar biases, but that it ultimately describes a unique type of cognitive pitfall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;You’re going the wrong way!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In their paper, they provide the example of someone whose flight from San Francisco to New York becomes massively delayed early on, leaving them stuck in Los Angeles. In one scenario, the traveler can get home three hours earlier than their current itinerary if they accept the airline’s offer of a new flight that first stops in Denver; in the second, the person is instead offered a flight that will also shave three hours off, but they’ll first have to travel back to San Francisco. Despite both flights saving the same amount of time, people are more likely to refuse the one that requires going back to their earlier destination, the paper explains (some people might even refuse the Denver flight, but that would be an example of the status quo bias and/or sunk cost fallacy at work, they note).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To test their hypothesis, the researchers ran four different types of experiments. The experiments collectively involved more than 2,500 adults, some of whom were UC Berkeley students and others who were volunteers recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. In one test, people were asked to walk along different paths in virtual reality; another asked people to recite as many words starting with the same letter as possible. Across the various tests, the researchers found that people routinely exhibited this aversion.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In one experiment where people had to recite words starting with “G,” for instance, everyone was asked midway through if they wanted to stay with the same letter or switch to reciting words starting with “T” (a likely easier letter). In the control condition, this decision was framed as staying on the same task, simply with a new letter, but in the other, people were asked if they wanted to throw out the work they had done so far and start over on a new task. Importantly, the volunteers were also given progress bars for the task, allowing them to see they would perform the same amount of work no matter the choice (though again, “T” would be easier). About 75% of participants made the choice to switch in the control condition, but only 25% did the same when the switch was presented as needing to double back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Backwards feels wrong&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When I was analyzing these results, I was like, ‘Oh, is there a mistake? How can there be such a big difference?'” said lead author Kristine Cho, a behavioral marketing PhD student at UC Berkely’s Haas School of Business, in a &lt;a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/2025-aug-doubling-back-aversion.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; to the Association for Psychological Science, publishers of the study.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Other researchers will have to confirm the team’s findings, of course. And there are still plenty of questions to answer about this aversion, including how often we fall for it and whether it’s more likely to happen in some scenarios than others. But for now, it’s oddly comforting to know that there’s another thing I can possibly blame for my occasional stubbornness to take the faster subway train home.&lt;/p&gt;

While the city is not required to regularly inspect cooling towers, health department spokesperson Chantal Gomez said the agency aims to inspect every tower annually. She added that staff shortages have made that difficult in recent years, but the agency is continuing to recruit inspectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="4pif4"&gt;Harlem Hospital, a city-run medical center where many Legionnaires’ patients in the current outbreak have been treated, also tested positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="f5fcq"&gt;City officials said they are still working to confirm which specific cooling tower caused the current outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="fadhi"&gt;Legionella bacteria can grow in buildings’ water-cooling towers and then get spewed into the air with the mist the towers emit. If it’s inhaled, Legionella can cause Legionnaires’ disease, a severe form of pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6nunu"&gt;The city previously said 11 cooling towers in the area had tested positive for Legionella through an initial screening process, but declined to share their addresses at the time. City officials said they have now completed a more rigorous form of testing and found 12 cooling towers that tested positive.

Legionnaires’ can be treated effectively with antibiotics if it’s caught early, city health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="fvq1o"&gt;Morse said she and other city health workers have been busy spreading the word about Legionnaires’ to keep people safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5iqm5"&gt;But some Harlem residents criticized the city for not previously releasing the addresses of the water-cooling towers that initially screened positive for Legionella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7ksqn"&gt;Morse &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/acting-nyc-health-commissioner-defends-citys-communications-on-legionnaires-disease" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;defended&lt;/a&gt; the move on WNYC earlier this week, saying, “The reason we have yet to release the building locations, again, is because of this concern that we’d be giving people a false sense of security before our investigation is really fully complete.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="a587t"&gt;At the time, Morse said that because Legionella can travel through the air, everyone in the five affected ZIP codes should be vigilant about Legionnaires’ symptoms, regardless of whether they live near the buildings that tested positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ajh70"&gt;State Sen.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Charles Gerba, a professor of microbiology and public health at the University of Arizona, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/brain-eating-infections-could-become-more-common-scientists-warn"&gt;Live Science&lt;/a&gt;: 'What you might see is spikes in these organisms after an extreme weather event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So the more nutrients in the water, the more bacteria you'll get. We're seeing it creeping up to states further and further north all the time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Missouri lake where the latest case has emerged is a man-made reservoir created in 1931 with the completion of Bagnell Dam on the Osage River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today, it draws tens of thousands of visitors with dozens of picturesque swimming spots, along with fishing and watersports activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There had been no prior warnings about the lake being contaminated with bacteria or other harmful organisms and health experts say that despite the recent incident, there is not an elevated risk associated with the body of water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To reduce the risk of infection in warm freshwater health officials have advised swimmers to hold their noses shut, to keep their heads above water, to avoid activities in the water during periods of high temperatures and to avoid digging sediment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US only suffers a handful of deaths from brain-eating amoebas each year, usually among people swimming &lt;a class="" href="/health/article-11062301/Brain-eating-amoeba-hiding-rivers-lakes-America-summer.html" target="_self"&gt;in warm water lakes and rivers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-282400b0-792e-11f0-a137-95e9d181ae1e" class=""&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; is among the states that have suffered the largest burden of brain-eating amoeba cases, with 39 of the 164 cases recorded in the US occurring in the Lone Star state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The single-cell organism, which thrives in warm waters, kills 97 percent of the people it infects as it causes a disease called primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, also known as PAM or amebic meningitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initial symptoms include a headache, vomiting and nausea. A person can then suffer cognitive issues and a stiff neck as things progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It causes severe swelling, and eventually rotting, of the brain and spinal cord. This will almost always eventually lead to death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are no known effective treatments for PAM. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A total of 157 Naegleria fowleri cases were reported in the US from 1962 to 2022, the latest map available, with a state-by-state breakdown shown above.

This includes Caleb Ziegelbauer from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/florida/index.html" id="mol-282427c0-792e-11f0-a137-95e9d181ae1e"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, who was 13 years old at the time he was infected by &lt;span&gt;the microscopic species.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caleb is now walking somewhat but the damage done to his brain means he needs to communicate with facial expressions and has to use a wheelchair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials believe the South Carolina child was infected while swimming in a local lake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The incident is not the first case of a Naegleria fowleri infection in South Carolina and there have also been other deaths linked to to the organism over recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In June, a 71-year-old woman from Texas contracted an infection and died from Naegleria fowleri after she rinsed her sinuses with tap water from an RV's water system at a campground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in 2023, a 16-month-old toddler from Arkansas &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-9894927/Seven-year-old-boy-dies-contracting-rare-brain-eating-parasite-California-lake.html" class=""&gt;died after coming into contact with the same one-celled organism&lt;/a&gt; at a water playground with fountains and jets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The amoeba, which is 1,200 times smaller than a dime, enters the body through the olfactory nerve which connects the upper nose to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health floatRHS" data-version="2" id="mol-28231650-792e-11f0-a137-95e9d181ae1e" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15001191/brain-eating-amoeba-missouri-naegleria-fowleri.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;What is Naegleria fowleri? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Naegleria fowleri is an amoeba that 'literally eats the brain tissue,' according to Dr Anjan Debnath, a parasitic disease expert at the University of California, San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It thrives in warm climates in freshwater including hot springs and lakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Improper water treatment in pools, private ponds and even tap water can lead to deadly exposure to the amoeba as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The amoeba travels up the nose where it has a direct route to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once a person's olfactory nerve in the nose is exposed, symptoms typically come on within one to nine days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who are infected will usually die within five days of symptoms first appearing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early stage symptoms resemble those of the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms as the infection worsens include severe neurological issues like seizures, hallucinations, confusion, and coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This gives it a short and direct route into the brain. If water containing the amoeba enters the nose, it will likely lead to infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ingesting water through the mouth is ok because stomach acid is strong enough to kill the amoeba. The nose is its only route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once a person's olfactory nerve is exposed, it can take around one to nine days to start experiencing symptoms. They will usually die within five days of symptoms first appearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's quite rapid, it's very progressive. It literally eats the brain tissue,' Dr Anjan Debnath, a parasitologist at the University of California San Diego, explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of the rare infection, doctors also often misdiagnose symptoms as meningitis - wasting valuable time that could be used to treat the parasite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Debnath describes the infection as taking part in two stages. The first is relatively minor, with the person experiencing a headache and other flu-like symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means that unless a doctor knows that a person has been swimming in untreated water they may not even suspect the amoeba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once symptoms reach the second stage, a person will start experiencing severe neurological issues like seizures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A doctor will then likely find out about the infection through a spinal fluid test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;America suffers around three cases of the amoeba each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They will almost always occur over summer, when many families flock to local lakes and ponds for a daytime outing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Debnath still advises against swimming in untreated water over summer, especially in places like Florida and Texas where temperatures get exceptionally high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because the amoeba only resides in fresh water, swimming in the ocean is generally safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If families do choose to visit a freshwater beach, anyone entering the water should wear a nose clip to prevent water from entering their nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Debnath also recommends against kicking up dirt or sand from the bottom of the lake as warmer areas deep down are where the microscopic beings usually lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down in the environment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study checked the blood of about 300 firefighters from four departments across the country who were exposed to high levels of Pfas. The chemicals are the main ingredient in most firefighting foam, and are frequently used in “turnout gear” worn by firefighters because of their heat repelling properties&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Furlong said she was surprised to find the number of genes and biological pathways that were impacted by Pfas, which suggests the chemicals may cause or contribute to a broad range of health problems. The study did not prove the chemicals cause certain diseases, but findings point to biological changes that might precede disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Genes play a range of roles in developing or preventing disease, and Pfas essentially change the way the genes are supposed to act, Furlong said. A gene may act as tumor suppressor, but the Pfas interferes with how it expresses, which affects whether cancer develops, or the type of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For example, PFOS, among the most common and dangerous Pfas compounds, reduces levels of miR-128-1-5p, a gene tied to cancer development.

Vitamin B12 deficiency isn't too common. Still, there are a few situations where supplemental vitamin B12 should be considered, and two of them are specific for people with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People with Type 1 diabetes, which usually presents itself during childhood, are at a high risk for other autoimmune diseases, including pernicious anemia — an autoimmune destruction of the cells in the stomach that make a protein called intrinsic factor. This protein is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. Multiple autoimmune diseases are often diagnosed in the same person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also:&lt;/strong&gt; R&lt;a href="/story/life/advice/2025/08/13/dr-roach-rash-and-hives-develop-after-taking-an-aramotase-inhibitor/85507213007/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/life/advice/2025/08/13/dr-roach-rash-and-hives-develop-after-taking-an-aramotase-inhibitor/85507213007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;ash and hives develop after taking an aramotase inhibitor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People with Type 2 diabetes who take metformin are at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency due to poor absorption. I recommend testing vitamin B12 in people who have been on metformin for a long time. Proton-pump inhibitors (like omeprazole) may also reduce B12 absorption to the point of deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People who are very strict with avoiding any type of animal products will develop B12 deficiency over the years unless they use supplements. Finally, people who can't absorb nutrients for a variety of reasons (such as bariatric surgery, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, bacterial overgrowth, fish tapeworm, and disease of the pancreas) may all become B12-deficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Treatment of B12 deficiency depends on the underlying cause. For example, a vegan only needs about 1 mcg a day to avoid B12 deficiency. By contrast, people with pernicious anemia need 1,000 times the usual oral dose of B12 or B12 injections. Measuring B12 levels to ensure adequate supplementation is wise in people who have difficulty absorbing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For healthy people (apart from the above and a few other rare conditions) with a non-vegan diet, it is not necessary to supplement B12, nor is testing necessary. B12 toxicity is essentially unheard of since the body simply excretes the B12 that you don't need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Apart from severe absorption problems like pernicious anemia, the dosing of B12 supplementation is the same whether a person has diabetes or not. Fifty micrograms a day is almost always more than enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; Is the Naltrexone shot (for alcohol abstinence) more effective when given on one side of the body compared to the other? A person I know who receives the shots feels that it's only effective when they receive it on their right buttock. Is this possible, or could they be noticing a placebo effect?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— C.M.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear C.M.:&lt;/strong&gt; Naltrexone is an effective treatment for people with alcohol dependence. The exact effectiveness depends on the setting, but people who use naltrexone are less likely to relapse on their drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Of course the drug will be absorbed just as well from the left side as the right. However, our expectations can have a huge influence on the effectiveness of a treatment. When there is an expectation of benefit, there is a placebo effect. (When there is an expectation of harm, it's called a nocebo effect.) The placebo effect isn't as critical in a situation like antibiotics for pneumonia but can be of immense importance when the desired effect is a decrease in alcohol cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If I were this person's doctor, I would keep giving the injection on their right side.&lt;em&gt; Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 11:39:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1AFBVV95cUxNNWVkY05RV25zUEFuYXlIb1hzM0Zja294V0N2b005RmJiRmU3aUZNZlV4aE1memRSNkRCMGpEa1RBRW81RmY0ZU1NZkNWdXphSDFZOVM0NVJNTG5WbVc1VE92WWlURGN1M1Z4dzlScW9xOWV6c1Nzc2t4bDJTbmxMZndaeHFhZ1kxR20wZzVwQUpEaEFrUGNfRWM1N2RUaDhHRXU5d3VORlBmMTZBQ3BnSWx5Z3BRWEROUW9KSUY5ZHR2Ml9yajJ1SHlWVHI5MGtBRWU1Sg</guid></item><item><title>“只是时间问题” ：海水变暖将使感染科德角游泳者的食肉细菌更常见-波士顿环球报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxOUWh0MGw4WGdrTm9JUmw2elU0SlBpTlVUbVF5ZlpNdVVnWmhqSVlieXoxNXJtdGhSbVdvSFBQUXhOUHVEYkNSTl8wQUZLWkhPbTVmSzdSY1EtcVJ5eEFpeW10eTRTRHRScnF3eGtib09yZkI2Q2N3VVoyUjdnZzN4cjk4cklCMlhmNkctVm9Pa21sRkw0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content
              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;That’s where climate change comes in, making New England waters friendlier for the potentially deadly bacteria.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“With warmer water temperatures moving further north, it allows Vibrios to survive, during summer months in particular, at higher latitudes than it had previously,” said Hamer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And the water is warmer. Midsummer ocean temperatures were about 2.75 degrees warmer in the period from 2021 to 2025 than they were 20 years ago, according to data from an &lt;a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/physocean.html?bdate=20250715&amp;amp;edate=20250815&amp;amp;units=standard&amp;amp;timezone=GMT&amp;amp;id=8447930&amp;amp;interval=6" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/physocean.html?bdate=20250715&amp;amp;edate=20250815&amp;amp;units=standard&amp;amp;timezone=GMT&amp;amp;id=8447930&amp;amp;interval=6"&gt;ocean temperature monitor&lt;/a&gt; in Woods Hole, near where the swimmer contracted the virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“A couple degrees difference will allow greater growth” of the bacteria, said Hamer. “And if it continues to rise, we’re going to see even more over the next five to 10 years.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The oceans absorb more than 90 percent of the extra heat created by climate change, leading to sea level rise as water molecules expand and glaciers melt; supplying&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;extra energy for hurricanes, which are fueled by heat at the surface of the ocean; and providing a more hospitable place for certain kinds of bacteria. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Scientists has been watching as Vibrio vulnificus infections have climbed northward as the planet warms. Between 1988 and 2018, wound infections from the bacteria increased eight-fold (from 10 to 80 cases per year) in the eastern United States, and the northern limit of reported cases moved north by roughly 30 miles each year, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-28247-2" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-28247-2"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Nature. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;By the middle of this century, between 2041 and 2060, the authors of the study projected that Vibrio vulnificus would be occurring as far north as Boston, and found that in a scenario where the world does not sufficiently rein in greenhouse gas emissions, caused primarily by the burning of fossil fuels, it could extend into southern Maine toward the end of the century. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The good news is, as of now, this kind of infection is very rare in Massachusetts. The state has recorded seven cases of Vibrio vulnificus in the last several years, of which just four were likely exposed in Massachusetts. But Department of Public Health officials want to &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/department-of-public-health-alerts-public-to-rare-vibrio-vulnificus-bacteria-in-coastal-waters" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/news/department-of-public-health-alerts-public-to-rare-vibrio-vulnificus-bacteria-in-coastal-waters"&gt;get the word out&lt;/a&gt; because, when people do contract an infection from the bacteria, the stakes are high. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;One in five people with a Vibrio vulnificus infection die, sometimes within a day or two of getting sick, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;. Others may end up needing an amputation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“There are increasing numbers of people who are immunocompromised by disease or by medication, and people in those categories are at higher risk of both contracting the disease and developing severe complications of the disease,” said &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/ceid/about-the-center/team/larry-madoff-md/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bu.edu/ceid/about-the-center/team/larry-madoff-md/"&gt;Larry Madoff&lt;/a&gt;, medical director of the state Department of Public Health. “And this is the time of year, right? This is when the waters are warm and warming.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Madoff warned that people with underlying medical conditions in particular should be cautious about swimming in the ocean if they have scrapes or cuts and eating raw or undercooked seafood, which is another way people can contract the bacteria. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“If I had a small scratch and I had bad liver disease, I would just stay out of the water,” Madoff said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But he’s also not warning people away. “It’s a good way of staying cool.

Valley fever is a serious illness that’s here to stay in California,” said Erica Pan, director of the state public health department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials say the current count is likely to be revised upward as there are often delays in reporting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valley fever is most prevalent in the San Joaquin Valley and southern part of the state where the fungus, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;occidioides&lt;/i&gt;, thrives in dry, arid soil. Case numbers are also climbing in the northern Central Valley, though, and along the state’s Central Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(22)00202-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;Researchers speculate&lt;/a&gt; the rise is tied to patterns of drought and precipitation. Periods of severe drought followed by wet winter and dry summer seem to coincide with more people getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also suspect &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-04-04/how-climate-change-is-making-valley-fever-worse"&gt;climate change has expanded the fungi’s range&lt;/a&gt; into areas where it was previously rare. For instance, since 2023, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverProvisionalDashboard.aspx#notes" target="_blank"&gt;Monterey County’s case numbers have exploded&lt;/a&gt;. There were 47 cases in 2023 and 348 this year as of July 31. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases also doubled since 2023 in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverProvisionalDashboard.aspx#notes" target="_blank"&gt;Contra Costa, Fresno, San Luis Obispo and Merced&lt;/a&gt; counties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People contract Valley fever by inhaling the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;occidioides&lt;/i&gt; spores, released when wind, wildfire, tractors, bulldozers, digging or even dancing disturbs the soil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, at least 19 people who &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-10-02/the-threat-of-valley-fever-is-growing-in-central-california"&gt;attended Lightning in a Bottle, a five-day music and art festival held at Buena Vista lake in Kern County&lt;/a&gt;, got sick — including several with pneumonia-like symptoms, rashes, headaches and exhaustion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most people infected won’t get symptoms and will fight off the infection naturally. Those who do feel sick may be hard-pressed to know what they have, since the symptoms are similar to COVID or the flu, further complicating efforts to address the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to remind Californians, travelers to California and their healthcare providers to watch for signs and symptoms of Valley fever to help detect it early,” Pan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In rare cases, the fungus can spread to other parts of the body and cause severe disease or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valley fever is not contagious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pan urged people to seek help from a medical provider if they’ve had a cough, fever, trouble breathing and tiredness for more than 7 to 10 days — especially if they’ve been outdoors in dusty air in the Central Valley or Central Coast regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pets are also susceptible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said people can reduce their risk while traveling in the San Joaquin Valley and much of the southwestern United States by staying indoors and keeping doors and windows closed when it’s windy; keeping car windows closed and using recirculated air instead of fresh; wetting soil before digging or disrupting; and wearing a properly fitted N95 mask if the outdoors can’t be avoided.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNQ3psRE80ZUNMZThUczQ2UmlZT3hPRjFhdTJFbFVQNk02ZE5pQlo4S0JGV2N0LUVuXzhudktvNUFjRzc4cDA5NnJmSTB5T0xtTDZRaGdiaWxkVzhobUJHZDEyeVhVOGNwM2t0NW1wT2xiUldtdUlSOC1HM1lXY3FZVFZLZnh3LXBwVTgw</guid></item><item><title>根据心脏外科医生的说法，纯素食者和素食者的5种最佳蛋白质来源-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigJBVV95cUxNazN1THlCUjFFYUNBUVVtR2RtSGtiS1M0Q21CazREUjZSTnNKaW5udXpvMl9MU0YxQnBWVURNbHUtd2M5NVJ1SGNRY0pEeklhd0ZUWEVDQ1dRNnlUOU5GdXJ5LU4wNmNKQktTUFVnTjU3T3BscXBvVklya1JrVmphSmNiVGpPNGpLRGRZZGlHSUNPWmRjc19FODRrS01hOWF3emVIWjVYelJfWWdOWEJfTmJkZ1BLTjExbHBZWGdhTlQ5eXdWRFFEM2g1N0szNWFXRzc0Mm90WDlsdmhNcHJjT3JPalFUWXRiVmFDcGlHQlM0MEk4MTdBTUl2TjRMLVZ1TzhnQ19Xck9IZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is essential for many body processes. It is the building block for muscles, bones, cartilage, skin, and blood. Protein also plays a crucial role in the production of enzymes, hormones, and antibodies. It also helps in cell repair, growth, and various metabolic processes. You are supposed to get 10% of your daily calories from protein. But does that necessarily mean consuming a lot of meat every day? Higher amount of meat intake is also linked to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34587250/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000210286" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, and even &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27597529/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Also, what about vegans and vegetarians? How do they get their protein? Dr. Steven Gundry, MD, a former cardiac surgeon and bestselling author, has recently shared some of the high-protein sources that involve no animal meat. Take a look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Lentils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lentils are of the best sources of plant-based protein you can get. One cup (198g) of cooked lentils contains 18 g of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/172421/nutrients" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. It is also low in calories and is rich in resistant starch and prebiotic fiber, which is good for the gut microbiome. Your gut is going to thank you because a single cup of lentils will give you half of your recommended daily fiber. “Soak or pressure-cook lentils to reduce lectins, which can impact or slow down nutrient absorption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can add lentils to soups, stews, or homemade veggie burgers,” the cardiac surgeon told CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Flaxseeds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the most underrated protein source. They are an excellent source of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4375225/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, omega-3s, and lignans, which have hormone-balancing benefits. The doctor recommends consuming ground flaxseeds because the whole ones are difficult to digest, and the bioavailability of their beneficial compounds suffers. The doctor revealed that he keeps a bag of organic whole flax in the refrigerator and grinds it as needed to ensure freshness. You can add them to smoothies, sprinkle them on salads, or oats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Barù nuts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another good protein source, Dr. Gundry suggests, is Barù nuts. They are native to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20564449/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and are loaded with protein. It has more protein than any other nut. Also rich in antioxidants and fiber, these nuts have an earthy flavour. They are available in grocery stores and online. The doctor reveals that he munches on a handful of nuts daily. “They taste like a cross between peanuts and almonds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Spirulina&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, spirulina, the blue-green algae, is a protein-dense food. About 70% of it is protein. Also rich in iron, B vitamins, and a powerful antioxidant called phycocyanin, spirulina can boost brain and immune function. “Try adding spirulina to your smoothies or juices. You can also substitute it with chlorella, another nutrient-rich alga, in powder or tablet form,” he suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;6 Foods that help you poop better and relieve constipation in the morning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sorghum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are sick of eating quinoa or couscous, try &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666833524000297" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;sorghum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. This ancient grain is an excellent source of protein. One cup of sorghum has about 21 g of protein, which is about twice what quinoa can provide! You can also grind it into flour and use it to bake, and also make pasta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 08:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigJBVV95cUxNazN1THlCUjFFYUNBUVVtR2RtSGtiS1M0Q21CazREUjZSTnNKaW5udXpvMl9MU0YxQnBWVURNbHUtd2M5NVJ1SGNRY0pEeklhd0ZUWEVDQ1dRNnlUOU5GdXJ5LU4wNmNKQktTUFVnTjU3T3BscXBvVklya1JrVmphSmNiVGpPNGpLRGRZZGlHSUNPWmRjc19FODRrS01hOWF3emVIWjVYelJfWWdOWEJfTmJkZ1BLTjExbHBZWGdhTlQ5eXdWRFFEM2g1N0szNWFXRzc0Mm90WDlsdmhNcHJjT3JPalFUWXRiVmFDcGlHQlM0MEk4MTdBTUl2TjRMLVZ1TzhnQ19Xck9IZw</guid></item><item><title>使用这6种最佳维生素和补充剂改善眼睛健康- CNET</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxPZnI5ZnQ5aEpXZkk2WlBOQ196NlM1R1NTYWktZm1mT2Y3OXNqSFV3WUtqUnljSUtpWk1PclBBeUptSjNnR2xESWJkakRfSEVTb2wxXzBZWXNxTlF3WEpybmVtN1dCbU5hRVVaRXcyWmdHNHpaUWZhU1B3d2Q2aG83cGVqZ0tzYlB5aW5IVExOQXpUZkJpdDRKblV0YjNPNXhIVDF0RjRfTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;The bright summer sunshine can do wonders for your &lt;a target="_self" data-id="53926bae-a8b2-465f-b67a-46217aa92fcd" href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/spring-into-mental-wellness-8-hobbies-that-can-boost-your-happiness/" class="editor-rtfLink"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;, but the increase in allergens and &lt;a target="_self" data-id="53926bae-a8b2-465f-b67a-46217aa92fcd" href="https://www.cnet.com/health/personal-care/how-to-protect-your-eyes-from-the-suns-uv-rays/" class="editor-rtfLink"&gt;harmful UV rays&lt;/a&gt; is not as kind to your eyes.

But what we don't know is that many scientific ideas are playing into attraction, many of which we are unaware of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are in love with the idea of romantic love, and that ideal leads us astray and into a lot of problems," says&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Decoding-Love-Revelations-Science-Attraction/dp/B002BWQ4TG" rel="sponsored"&gt; Andrew Trees, Ph.D., author of &lt;em&gt;Decoding Love&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; Learning a little about the science of attraction and how biology plays such a huge factor in determining who you attract (and are attracted to) just may help you play the dating game a bit better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here are nine uncontrollable biological factors that make someone intensely attracted to you:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Fertility cycle&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study by &lt;a href="https://www.unm.edu/~gfmiller/cycle_effects_on_tips.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the amount of tips lap dancers receive is directly tied to their fertility cycle. Compared to a menstruating lap dancer, who made on average $35 an hour, women who were ovulating made $70 per hour. Researchers speculate that men may respond to subtle changes in body odor, lip color, pupil dilation, and skin tone that can occur due to &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/2016298663/what-happens-when-you-ovulate"&gt;hormone changes during ovulation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for non-lap dancers? If you want to meet a man: "Men are programmed to seek out women who are more fertile," says Trees. "Always make sure to schedule dates around ovulation if you can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Body odor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-08/factors-make-someone-intesely-attracted-odor.png" alt="Person attracted to other person's odor" title="Factors make someone intensely attracted odor" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;View Apart via Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Smell is a way to determine genetic compatibility," says Trees. Because modern society emphasizes good hygiene, bodily smells that were once used to detect genetic compatibility are masked. What's worse, "birth control appears to reverse a woman's usual smell preferences," says Trees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When a woman is on the Pill, she tends to choose men who smell similar to her father or brother." Women who take birth control may be more apt to choose someone with a similar genetic profile, even though a man with a different genetic profile would be better for her offspring, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/health/surprising-way-body-odor-predicts-who-youll-get-along-with"&gt;The Surprising Way Body Odor Predicts Who You'll Get Along With&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Height&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short men are at a disadvantage when it comes to the dating game. "Height is valued in the marketplace, and tall men do make more on average," says Trees, which doesn't bode well for a shorter man's dating possibilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a study of more than 20,000 online daters by the University of Chicago and Dan Ariely of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a man who is five feet tall would need to make $325,000 more than a six-foot-tall man to be as successful in the online dating market. A 5'4" man would need to make $229,000 more, while an average-sized man of 5'6" would need to take in $183,000 more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Adrenaline&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next time you plan a date, you may want to do something a bit more adventurous than dinner and a movie. A study performed b&lt;a href="https://sanlab.psych.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2016/03/Dutton-Aron-1974-arousal.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;y social psychologist Arthur Aron&lt;/a&gt; found that adrenaline can enhance feelings of attraction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trees describe Aron's study in his book. An attractive woman waited for men to cross Vancouver's Capilano Canyon Suspension Bridge, which was constructed with wooden boards and cables that tilt and sway in the wind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a man crossed the precarious bridge, the woman would walk up to him, explain she was conducting a study about attractive scenery, and give him her name and number. Compared to results from a control group that operated nearby on a safer bridge, men who crossed the Capilano were eight times more likely to call the woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/strange-moment-turned-midlife-into-adventure-not-crisis"&gt;The Strange Moment That Turned My Midlife Into An Adventure, Not A Crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Facial symmetry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your left side mirrors your right side, you have a better chance of scoring a date, says Trees. "If you take a face and compare it to a composite face, the composite is always judged as more attractive," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason? The more faces you use to make one composite face, the more symmetrical it becomes. "As you become more symmetrical, the attractiveness ratings go up," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1996-94160-015" rel="nofollow"&gt;A report from The American Psychological Association&lt;/a&gt; (APA) found that women are more likely to enjoy intimacy when their partners are symmetrical. A possible explanation is that symmetry acts as an indicator of good genetic health, and the more diseases and illnesses someone has, the less symmetrical they tend to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Sense of humor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-08/factors-make-someone-intesely-attracted-humor.png" alt="Couple attracted by humor" title="Factors make someone intensely attracted humor" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Krakenimages.com via Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter is not only the best medicine, but it can also help you score a date. "People use humor as a proxy for intelligence and creativity," says Trees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://europepmc.org/article/pmc/pmc10480874" rel="nofollow"&gt;2015 study,&lt;/a&gt; personality and sense of humor are rated higher than physical appearance when it comes to choosing a date. However, it seems that what men and women mean when they say they're looking for "someone with a sense of humor" differs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women are more apt to want someone who makes them laugh, while men want someone who will laugh at their jokes, according to &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-21361-000" rel="nofollow"&gt;research from the International Society for Humor Studies&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers posit that a woman uses humor as an indicator of intelligence and creativity, while a man uses his wit for seduction. "That's not always the case," says Trees. "But there's something aggressive in humor, and men can get intimidated when women are too funny or sharp-tongued."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/amazing-things-happen-when-you-laugh"&gt;7 Amazing Things That Happen To You And Your Body When You Laugh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Love hormones&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love can make people do strange things, but it can do even stranger things to your brain. &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/experts/the-anatomy-of-love"&gt;Dr. Lucy Brown&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the department of neurology and neuroscience at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-07225-013" rel="nofollow"&gt;found that people's brains &lt;/a&gt;were flooded with dopamine, a neurotransmitter that affects pleasure and motivation, when they were shown photographs of their lovers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, love seems to trigger the same kind of &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/love/falling-love-like-being-on-this-drug-according-research"&gt;euphoric effects&lt;/a&gt; achieved by certain drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. Musical taste&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, music is said to soothe the soul. But did you know rock music can help boost your level of attractiveness? A &lt;a href="https://medienportal.univie.ac.at/media/aktuelle-pressemeldungen/detailansicht/artikel/wenn-musik-maennliche-gesichter-attraktiver-macht/" rel="nofollow"&gt;study by North Adams State College in Massachusetts &lt;/a&gt;found that women judging photographs of men found them to be more physically attractive when they were listening to rock music as opposed to when they were listening to jazz or no music at all. "[Rock music] doesn't strike me as romantic," says Trees. "But that's just one more of the strange foibles of the science of attraction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/always-need-music-brain-trying-tell-something-important"&gt;If You Always Need Music On In The Background, Your Brain May Be Trying To Tell You Something Important&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9. Hair&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-04250-005" rel="nofollow"&gt;study by the Evolutionary Psychology Research Group&lt;/a&gt;, men rated the physical appearance of long-haired women higher than short-haired women, regardless of their facial attractiveness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/powerful-abilities-people-naturally-long-hair"&gt;Men described women with long hair&lt;/a&gt; as determined, intelligent, independent, and healthy individuals.

And if you like a glass of wine with dinner or a cocktail on the weekends, brace yourself: New guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/guidelines/high-blood-pressure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:released Thursday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;released Thursday&lt;/a&gt; suggest you abstain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Committees from the heart organizations continuously assess the latest research so they can help medical providers figure out the best approach to &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, but this is the first new set of guidelines since 2017. Heart disease has long been the No. 1 killer in the world and blood pressure is one of the most easily modifiable ways to avoid such a death. Keeping your blood pressure in check can also reduce your risk of kidney disease, type 2 diabetes and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of all adults in the US have higher than normal blood pressure. The goal numbers for adults haven’t changed, according to the guidelines: Normal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg, elevated blood pressure is 120-129/80 mm Hg. If you are at 130/80 mmHg or higher, according to the new guidelines, your medical provider will want you to make some changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury, which is abbreviated as mm Hg. The measurement has an upper number, or systolic reading, and a lower number, a diastolic reading: Systolic pressure measures the force of blood as it pumps out of the heart into the arteries, and diastolic is the pressure created as the heart rests between beats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure doesn’t have any symptoms typically. But when your blood pressure is high, the force of your blood pushes against the walls of your blood vessels, making your heart less efficient, so both the vessels and heart must work harder. Without treatment, high blood pressure will eventually damage your arteries, raising your risk of having a heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How high blood pressure is treated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new blood pressure guidelines say that if your systolic blood pressure is in the 130 to 139 range, your medical provider should first encourage you to adopt healthy lifestyle changes. After three to six months, if the lifestyle changes alone don’t lower your blood pressure to the goal range, then medication is recommended, the new guidelines say. That’s a shift from 2017 recommendation that anyone with systolic blood pressure above 140 should be prescribed lifestyle changes and medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So just trying to more aggressively control blood pressure, for it to be better for more people, to prevent cardiovascular disease, strokes, kidney disease, and now we know lowering blood pressure actually helps reduce the risk for dementia as well. So that’s really big news out of this guideline,” said Dr. Daniel Jones, American Heart Association chair of the writing committee for the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle changes, according to the new guidelines, include maintaining or achieving a healthy weight, eating a heart-healthy diet, reducing the amount of salt in what you eat and drink, managing stress, at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week and resistance exercise like weight training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s another shift from 2017: The new guidelines also recommend forgoing alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines used to say that if people chose to drink, it should be one drink or less a day for women, and two or less a day for men. Jones said there’s just too much evidence now that alcohol negatively impacts your blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people enjoy drinking, but because the evidence is there, we want you to make an informed decision,” said Jones, who is also dean and professor emeritus of the University of Mississippi School of Medicine. “There’s a lot of individual variability with the relationship between alcohol and blood pressure, but we put forward the ideal as abstinence, and for those who choose to drink, less than one for women and less than two for men.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on a growing body of evidence, there’s also more emphasis on how important it is to lower blood pressure to reduce the risk of developing dementia, Jones said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more studies about women having trouble with &lt;a href="https://www.goredforwomen.org/en/mom-life/for-moms-with-babies-and-toddlers/expert-advice-about-high-blood-pressure-and-pregnancy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure during pregnancy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;high blood pressure during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;, Jones said, the guidelines also newly emphasize how important it is for people who want to become pregnant or those who are pregnant to monitor their blood pressure. High blood pressure can hurt the pregnancy and can raise a person’s risk of having elevated blood pressure even long after pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietary recommendations still include the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan#:~:text=Description%20of%20the%20DASH%20Eating,sugar%2Dsweetened%20beverages%20and%20sweets" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DASH diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DASH diet &lt;/a&gt;which is a diet high on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oils and and low on fat, sugar, and tropical oils like coconut and palm oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also harp on sodium again and we know salt and alcohol are favorites for lots of people, but we do recommend limiting salt intake, increasing potassium intake,” Jones said. One easy way to do that is if cooking at home to use potassium-enriched salt substitutes. Sodium intake should be less than 2,300 mg per day, moving toward a more ideal limit of 1,500 mg per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with overweight or obesity, the guidelines recommend losing at least 5% of body weight. For people with more severe obesity, the guidelines recommend what Jones says are clinically proven interventions: diet and exercise, and weight loss medications &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/13901-glp-1-agonists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:including GLP-1s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;including GLP-1s&lt;/a&gt;. For people with very severe obesity, the guidelines also suggest surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones said he knows it can be difficult for people to keep their blood pressure in check, but taking these steps can help a person’s health significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reality is the first line of things we recommend for both prevention and treatment of high blood pressure have to do with eating and we live in a very difficult environment for food. It’s hard for people to have a low sodium intake. It’s hard for people to eat enough potassium. It’s hard for people to take in a small number of calories, but the good news is that all that stuff works if you’re willing to do it,” Jones said. “It’s hard, but it works.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For

class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Companies appear reluctant to carry out trials despite the fact that three previous studies all found that the drug shows promise as a way of slowing down the growth of cancerous cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Mifepristone’s role in medical abortions and fact that access to abortion is restricted in some countries is preventing much-needed research being done, the experts claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/tests-and-treatments/abortion/what-happens/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one of two drugs, alongside misoprostol&lt;/a&gt;, that women in the UK take when ending a pregnancy that began up to 10 weeks earlier. They take a mifepristone tablet, then wait for 24-48 hours and then take the misoprostol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It is deeply disappointing that the successful application of mifepristone in one area of clinical medicine is hindering more extensive research into other indications that could benefit public health,” the opinion piece written by eight co-authors and published in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Women’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; says.

They were published in 2008, 2022 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Mifepristone is a type of drug known as a selective progesterone receptor modulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If proven to work, it could help women who are at high risk of breast cancer, such as those who carry a variant of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Currently they are offered surgical options for their treatment, such as a mastectomy, or drugs that are of “low efficacy”, the authors say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;UK cancer charities endorsed the plea for drug companies to look seriously into the role mifepristone could play in breast cancer care and for governments to enable that to happen by easing regulations that restrict its use to abortion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Simon Vincent, the chief scientific officer at Breast &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Now, said: “More risk-reducing treatment options for women with a high risk of developing breast cancer, that also protects their quality of life, are desperately needed. And we need to explore all avenues, including existing drugs, to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“So early research into mifepristone is an important step forward and we need further studies to understand if these drugs are safe and effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Marianne Baker, Cancer Research UK’s science engagement manager, said the 57,900 new diagnoses a year of breast cancer in Britain showed that “it’s vital we invest in research exploring new ways to prevent the disease”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She added: “Cancer develops when cells grow uncontrollably. Early studies showed that mifepristone slowed down cell growth in breast tissue, so it might be useful in delaying or preventing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“But we need more research to understand whether it’s effective, how it works and who would benefit most from it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Kristina Gemzell Danielsson, the piece’s lead author, and who heads the department of women’s and children’s health at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said: “Stigma around mifepristone used for abortion is describing part of why mifepristone is not more extensively researched for prevention of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Taken together, our data support the use of mifepristone for prevention of poor prognosis breast cancer. All studies were randomised controlled trials using a low dose of mifepristone for two or three months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 01:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxNbV9yQ2tXMEtKUVpNLUd5UHRXX1VVX0NMcEdiWUp4SU5CSzBBbHY1R2l6NW5lU0FNQ01rVGdVV2VQY1FqYWVtNXNya21LNnBmWHdwZ3lwOUxpdDQ3N2l0eU5rOV83RktFQkdBVHdFU0I3Y19kT21ySXo4aF9GbjlRMTlDZWRqUzZ2LXlSUXhuazhSZ3lSOU1UYnlmNVRnLUpYZEZPQ3FpWXQ2RzV1UkdNVVR4dXc0MnRrZlJfVGFvZw</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，这种蔬菜可以延长您的寿命- EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE9Cc2ZKeTZ5aHFWM3ZEdmhFMkhzR2JNeWREWFpwWVFudnQtVUpFM1JWRlhocUI4Tk5fZDNKby1pXzcyRjlIRFRJWExaWUFKeENIYzl4ZFN3NkpaczJNMFp6bTRJYVM5YmtZeC0wMmhqUHlSUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You probably know you should eat your veggies, but did you know they can add years to your life? Research shows that eating plenty of fruits and vegetables can help you live longer by preventing or delaying the onset of chronic diseases like heart disease or certain cancers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While all vegetables are great for you, one stands out for its potential longevity benefits—and it’s one that you probably already have in your fridge. That superstar is spinach, a nutrient-packed leafy green worth adding to your plate. Here’s why dietitians recommend eating more spinach to add years to your life. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-spinach-is-a-longevity-star"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why Spinach Is a Longevity Star &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Rich in Antioxidants &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
If you want to live a longer and healthier life, keeping inflammation in check is a top priority. Fortunately, antioxidant-rich foods like spinach can help with this. According to &lt;a href="https://wellrootedhn.com/about-us/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Umo Callins, M.S., RD, CSSD, LD, CPT&lt;/a&gt;, spinach is rich in vitamin C and carotenoids like lutein and zeaxanthin, all of which help to fight free radicals and reduce inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Lower Your Chronic Disease Risk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Helping to delay or prevent chronic disease is a good reason to eat more spinach. Regularly eating spinach and other dark leafy greens is linked to a lower risk of many chronic conditions. For example, eating spinach may benefit heart health. “Spinach is high in nitrates, which have been shown to help blood pressure levels,” says &lt;a href="https://thebalancednutritionist.com/about-jamie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jamie Nadeau, RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; She adds that spinach may also reduce the risk of certain types of cancer thanks to its cancer-fighting compounds, including beta carotene, vitamin C, flavonols and other phytochemicals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Supports Your Gut Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;A growing body of research suggests that your gut health is an important predictor of longevity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One way to show your gut some love is to regularly eat more leafy greens like spinach, which contains fiber to support healthy digestion. For the most benefit, eat it cooked—one cup of cooked spinach has over four grams of fiber compared with less than one gram in the same amount of raw spinach.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s not where the gut benefits end, either. Spinach is also rich in carotenoids like beta-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin, which research has linked with greater diversity in the gut microbiome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Protect Your Brain As You Age &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Your brain’s biological age is one of the strongest predictors of longevity,” says &lt;a href="https://maggiemoon.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Maggie Moon, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s why reaching for spinach more often is a no-brainer for supporting your brain health. Moon adds that spinach is a longevity star since it’s high in folate, antioxidants and other phytochemicals that help with age-related cognitive decline. In fact, one study found that a high intake of green leafy vegetables such as spinach was associated with better cognitive function and slower cognitive decline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-add-spinach-to-your-diet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Add Spinach to Your Diet &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To score the most longevity benefits, you’ll want to add dark leafy greens like spinach to your plate a few times a week. The good news? Spinach is a versatile ingredient, making it easy to incorporate into meals. Here are a few of our favorite ways to add more spinach to your diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sautéed&lt;/strong&gt;. One of the simplest ways to prepare spinach is to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252947/simple-sauteed-spinach/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sauté it in a skillet&lt;/a&gt; with some garlic until it wilts. Moon likes to add a quick-cooking protein like eggs or shrimp to her sautéed spinach for a fast and versatile meal. For a well-rounded meal, try adding some complex carbs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blend into Smoothies&lt;/strong&gt;. Adding a handful of spinach to your morning smoothie can help you reach your daily vegetable goals while also supporting longevity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use as a Salad Green&lt;/strong&gt;. Fresh spinach makes a great base for salad. Since it has a subtle flavor, it pairs well with many different toppings. To maximize iron absorption from spinach, add vitamin C-rich foods to your salad, like bell peppers or citrus fruits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Color to Sandwiches or Wraps&lt;/strong&gt;. Fresh baby spinach makes a great addition to your favorite sandwich or wrap to add color and nutrition, says Nadeau.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try Frozen Spinach&lt;/strong&gt;. If you struggle to use up a whole package of fresh spinach before it gets slimy, try stocking up on frozen spinach instead. It still offers just as much nutritional value as fresh and can be easily incorporated into a variety of cooked dishes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-veggies-that-promote-longevity"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Veggies that Promote Longevity &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re not a fan of spinach or just want to mix things up, there are plenty of other vegetables that can promote longevity. “All leafy green vegetables, from arugula to romaine, are longevity heroes”, says Moon. Beyond greens, Callins notes that red and purple vegetables like cabbage and beets are also excellent additions to your diet. “They are rich in betalains and anthocyanins, which are natural pigments that have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that support cardiovascular health, metabolic health and brain function”.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to choosing vegetables for longevity, variety is key. Moon suggests aiming for at least five to nine different vegetables each week to ensure you get a wide range of longevity-supporting nutrients. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regularly eating more vegetables is a small, sustainable habit that not only supports your day-to-day well-being, but it may also add years to your life. Vegetables are packed with nutrients your body needs to combat inflammation, oxidative stress and support chronic disease prevention. Spinach is one standout veggie thanks to its nutrient-rich profile and versatility—its mild flavor makes it easy to add to dishes like smoothies, soups and stir-fries. Fresh or frozen, it’s time to stock up!&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean diet and others like it have been extensively linked to reducing the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mediterranean-diet-could-protect-against-a-common-form-of-liver-disease"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/12-year-study-reveals-how-the-mediterranean-diet-might-affect-your-brain"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-mediterranean-lifestyle-really-can-help-you-live-longer-study-shows"&gt;premature death&lt;/a&gt;. Now a new study provides more evidence that this choice of foods can protect against dementia – as well as giving us some clues as to why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team from Rush University Medical Center in Chicago wanted to look specifically at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIND_diet"&gt;the MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet&lt;/a&gt;, which combines elements of the Mediterranean diet with the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's a lot of acronyms, but it essentially means lots of vegetables, whole grains, fish, and poultry, and not so much dairy, red meat, and fried food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ask-yourself-these-4-questions-before-you-start-a-new-diet"&gt;Ask Yourself These 4 Questions Before You Start a New Diet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers investigated links between this balance of food items and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampal_sclerosis"&gt;hippocampal sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; – a condition linked to dementia and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="170804" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, where neurons die off in the brain's hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the postmortem brains of 809 people for whom diet information had been logged for several years before their death, the study found that those who stuck closest to the MIND diet were less likely to show signs of hippocampal sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings suggest that consuming a healthy diet, such as the MIND diet, may decrease the likelihood of hippocampal sclerosis and may support hippocampal health," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.26089"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170808" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170808" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainScan-1.jpg" alt="Brain scan" class="wp-image-170808 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainScan-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainScan-1-600x362.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170808" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers connected certain types of brain damage to diet choices. (Agarwal et al., &lt;em&gt;JAMA Netw.

This latest study offers fresh insight into a significant part of the reason why that link is there: the foods in the MIND diet appear to protect the hippocampus in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucial to remembering, learning, and navigating, damage to the hippocampus is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-one-isolated-brain-change-may-signal-alzheimers-study-finds"&gt;closely tied to dementia&lt;/a&gt;. While not everyone with hippocampal sclerosis has dementia, or vice versa, there's a significant overlap between the two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research accounted for a variety of demographic and genetic factors, but isn't enough to prove direct cause and effect. What it does show, together with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-say-this-one-particular-diet-may-slow-the-decline-of-the-brain"&gt;earlier studies&lt;/a&gt;, is a strong probability that dementia risk is to some extent affected by what we eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To our knowledge these are the first findings in human studies to report that the association of diet and dementia is partially mediated by hippocampal sclerosis," nutrition epidemiologist Puja Agarwal told Hannah Millington at &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/alzheimers-dementia-mind-diet-food-disease-prevention-2110316"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not clear how hippocampal sclerosis gets started, but scientists are continuing to discover more about it, and its connections to dementia. It's not the first time it's been shown that the health of this part of the brain could be &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2024.03.015"&gt;affected by diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies may endeavor to understand why this link exists.

No gym membership required. Just a pair of shoes and a willingness to alternate between brisk and slow-paced walking in three-minute bursts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubbed “Japanese walking,” the latest viral fitness trend is &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/japanese-walking?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;all over TikTok&lt;/a&gt; and has people wondering whether this short-interval workout can improve health more efficiently than a traditional stroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trend has spread across social media and beyond, with bloggers, online articles and major media outlets all jumping in on the walking routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protocol traces back to a&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0025619611613037" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; 2007 Japanese study&lt;/a&gt; that tested the effects of high-intensity interval walking on middle-aged and older adults. But the recent buzz started with a punchy video from Australian content creator and fitness coach Eugene Teo that surpassed 10 million views on TikTok and 17 million views on YouTube. Known to his over 426,000 TikTok followers and 1.22 million YouTube followers as “Coach Eugene,” Teo rebranded the science-backed routine into an accessible, algorithm-friendly idea: “Japanese walking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People don’t like fitness jargon,” Teo, 33, said in a recent interview with The Times. “They don’t like scientific terms … and if I want to impact millions globally … I like to make fitness advice and scientific jargon a lot more accessible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his video explainer, Teo describes the method: Walk fast for three minutes, slow down for three minutes and repeat the cycle five times.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;div id="breaking-news-signup-form" class="email-form rounded my-3 px-4 py-3"&gt;
                &lt;div class="row"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="col-12 col-md-6 mb-2 mb-md-0 text-center text-md-start"&gt;
                        &lt;h6 class="fs-4 mt-0 mb-1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't miss out on what's happening!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the small study of 186 women and 60 men, participants who followed this routine four or more days a week saw greater improvements in blood pressure, leg strength and aerobic capacity than those in the moderate-intensity continuous walking group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s that cardio work that a lot of people are missing,” Teo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teo, a longtime coach and nutritionist, didn’t invent the protocol, but he did help it reach millions. He said his viral video resonated with people overwhelmed by the pressure to hit 10,000 steps a day — a goal Teo himself often finds out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s been following this protocol on and off for years, ever since he came across the study. Usually, he does his walking on a treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people have this all-or-nothing approach where they think, ‘Oh, I can’t hit 10,000 steps. I’ve failed,’” he said. “It’s about just changing the stigma people have and that all-or-nothing mentality … of what fitness should be about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He emphasizes effort over perfection: Walk fast enough to get out of breath, but not so fast that you can’t finish the three-minute interval. The recovery periods are as slow as needed to reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is the science behind the trend as strong as the messaging?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Helga Van Herle, a cardiologist with Keck Medicine of USC, noted flaws in the original study’s design — namely, that only the high-intensity walking group was monitored with accelerometers, not the moderate intensity group, a bias that could have skewed results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This creates a major bias in the monitoring and compliance and could potentially skew the results in favor of the high-intensity training group,” she said in an email, pointing to &lt;a href="https://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/hawthorne/09.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Hawthorne effect&lt;/a&gt;, a phenomenon in which people alter their behavior because they know they’re being watched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Parveen Garg, also with Keck Medicine of USC, said he doesn’t see intense interval walking as a standout recommendation among physicians. The study, he said, was small and meant to be thought-provoking and encourage further research, not to support sweeping conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He supports any activity that gets people moving but cautions against over-hyping Japanese walking benefits or ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s kind of onerous,” he said, explaining that remembering to switch gears every three minutes, walking fast and slow and navigating technology isn’t easy for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said it’s possible to get similar benefits by walking continuously at a vigorous pace for a shorter time. But there isn’t enough evidence to confirm that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts agree that vigorous activity, even in short spurts, is beneficial. David Raichlen, professor of biological sciences and anthropology at USC, said short intervals of increased effort — even just walking briskly for a few minutes — can yield meaningful health effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s something to the idea that small amounts of vigorous activity are really beneficial,” Raichlen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raichlen also noted that calling high-intensity interval walking “Japanese walking” simply because of the study’s origin is problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yasuyuki Suzuki, a cardiac imaging specialist from Tokyo, is aware of the trend and the associated study. He said that while there is some new interest in the topic, it is not trending in Japan the way it appears to be in other parts of the world. He also said he does not feel any discomfort or concern about it being referred to as “Japanese walking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for whether this method is better than 10,000 steps or continuous walking, Raichlen is hesitant to say — the research just isn’t there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher walking cadence has been linked to lower dementia risk, Raichlen said. Also, walking in general has been tied to lower mortality, reduced cancer risk and improved cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do think there’s a lot of good from encouraging people to think about walking as exercise,” Raichlen said. “Finding ways to sort of make walking work better for you is, you know, not a bad thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the simplicity and catchy name may be why it took off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pretty much anybody in Los Angeles can go outside and walk around,” said Sarah T. Roberts, a UCLA associate professor and internet culture expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roberts sees the trend as a reflection of broader social forces, including medical mistrust and the rising cost of health care and fitness. “We’re in a moment of economic uncertainty,” she said. “For most people, a $300-a-month membership at Equinox is not a reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, she said, makes low-barrier trends like “Japanese walking” especially appealing. But Roberts cautioned against the risks of turning to TikTok and other social media platforms for medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stuff doesn’t happen in a vacuum,” she said. “There’s a bigger social and political context to all of these things, and the backdrop to these kinds of trends is not great.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roberts encourages viewers to critically evaluate where their health advice comes from and who profits from it. “People with big followings often have something to sell,” she said. “They’re not really acting in the public interest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Roberts said, with every health trend, social media companies are profiting. Although some platforms have tried to crack down on medical misinformation, Roberts said such content moderation has fallen out of favor because it affects revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Devaluing expertise means devaluing the collective knowledge that people have in certain domains,” Roberts said. “If I try to fix my own car, my car is probably not going to run very well. Now apply that to my body.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teo said fitness trends should be approached with discernment. He’s not claiming to replace traditional walking — just to offer a stepping stone for cardio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if a viral name is what it takes to get people walking, he’s OK with that. “As long as you’re not misleading people,” he said, “and there’s legitimate substance behind it, it’s a great way to spin things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teo, Raichlen, Garg and Roberts all agree on one thing: Talk to your doctor before starting any new exercise routine, especially one that reaches vigorous intensity.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We're still not sure exactly what causes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, but we know what its effects look like, and we're getting better at detecting the early signs of it – including, perhaps, those in our speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists from Boston University have developed a new AI ( &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-intelligence" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73092" data-postid="170777" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tip/Types-of-AI-algorithms-and-how-they-work"&gt;algorithm&lt;/a&gt; that analyzes the speech patterns of those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6O1cNKoCPw"&gt;predict a progression&lt;/a&gt; from MCI to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="170777" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; within six years with an accuracy of 78.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-early-speech-related-signs-youre-at-risk-of-alzheimers-disease"&gt;5 Early, Speech-Related Signs You're at Risk of Alzheimer's Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team's study, published in 2024, continues their &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.064029"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt;, where they trained a model – using voice recordings from over 1,000 individuals – to accurately detect cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their new algorithm was trained on transcribed audio recordings of 166 individuals with MCI, aged 63–97.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the team already knew who had developed Alzheimer's, a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning"&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt; approach could be used to find signs in &lt;span&gt;their transcribed speech&lt;/span&gt; that linked the 90 people whose cognitive function would decline into Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once trained, the algorithm could then be applied in reverse: to try and predict Alzheimer's risk from transcripts of speech samples it had never processed before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other important factors, including age and self-reported sex, were added to produce a final predictive score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145445" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145445" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/YearsToAlzheimersFromMCI.jpg" alt="A graph with blue columns " class="size-full wp-image-145445" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/YearsToAlzheimersFromMCI.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/YearsToAlzheimersFromMCI-603x415.jpg 603w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/YearsToAlzheimersFromMCI-600x413.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145445" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Number of MCI patients transitioning to Alzheimer's disease (AD) annually over six years.

It shows the power of AI."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering there's currently no cure for Alzheimer's, you might wonder what the benefit of detecting it early is – but we do have treatments that &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/treatments"&gt;can help manage Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; to some extent, and these can be started earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, early detection gives us more opportunity to study the disease and its progression, and from there develop a fully effective treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those known to be likely to develop Alzheimer's can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/major-alzheimers-trial-shows-new-drug-can-slow-disease-progression"&gt;participate in clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145446" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145446" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/PredictingAlzheimersFromSpeech.jpg" alt="Gaphic of the automated pipeline for Alzheimer's disease prediction from a neuropsychological test interview." class="size-full wp-image-145446" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/PredictingAlzheimersFromSpeech.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/PredictingAlzheimersFromSpeech-600x245.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145446" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The prediction process.

It's the sort of test that could be done quickly and inexpensively, even at home, and without any specialist equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't need any injections or samples, just a recording, and it could even be run through a smartphone app in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you can predict what will happen, you have more of an opportunity and time window to intervene with drugs, and at least try to maintain the stability of the condition and prevent the transition to more severe forms of dementia," Paschalidis &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/new-ai-program-could-predict-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recordings used here were rather rough and of low quality.

"It's an epidemic of congenital syphilis and infections in women of childbearing age."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;What is congenital syphilis?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Syphilis is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI). It starts as a painless sore where the infection entered the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This infection is easily treated with an antibiotic when caught early. If left untreated, it often progresses, over weeks or months, to a worsening rash that may be accompanied by symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, headache and fatigue, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/syphilis/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" dir="ltr"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Symptoms can resolve on their own over time but without treatment, syphilis enters a "latent stage," or asymptomatic stage, that can last for years and may progress further to a "tertiary stage" that can impact multiple organs in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/syphilis/about/about-congenital-syphilis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" dir="ltr"&gt;Congenital syphilis occurs&lt;/a&gt; when a pregnant person with untreated syphilis passes the infection to their baby either during pregnancy or at birth. It can be treated with antibiotics and it's best to treat as soon as possible to prevent more severe complications of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC recommends that all pregnant people get tested for syphilis at their first health care visit after learning they are pregnant. Some places with higher rates of this infection may recommend additional screening throughout pregnancy and at birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Partridge said women of childbearing age who have barriers to prenatal care are at greater risk because they may miss out on syphilis screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I see a lot of times that moms don't get those full screenings done, they don't have access to that kind of prenatal care. And that, to me, is just tragic because if moms can get screened, then they can get treated," Partridge said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;Why can it be so dangerous?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Congenital syphilis can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight, prematurity or infant death soon after birth, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/syphilis/about/about-congenital-syphilis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" dir="ltr"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Babies born with this disease can have deformed bones, low blood counts, jaundice and organ dysfunction, including problems with the brain and nervous system or enlarged liver and spleen. Partridge says common symptoms of congenital syphilis are known but many aren't obvious at birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I think up to 70% of babies who may meet the case definition for congenital syphilis are actually asymptomatic, which makes diagnosing it quite challenging," Partridge said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Without treatment, babies who are asymptomatic at birth can begin to show signs of the disease weeks, months or years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If they're undetected, if the infants are left untreated, they go on to develop what we call later sequelae, and that's when you see deafness, blindness, developmental delay, the quite devastating illness," Partridge said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;Why is congenital syphilis on the rise?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. James McDonald, commissioner of the NYDOH, told ABC News that the three newborn deaths from syphilis are concerning because it's uncommon to see infant deaths from the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;McDonald said that New York State has seen 21 cases of congenital syphilis so far this year, compared to 36 cases all of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Keep in mind, these may sound like big numbers, but for upstate New York, they are big numbers," he said. "What concerns me, though, is it should be zero."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Kristin Wall, an associate professor of epidemiology at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health, told ABC News the U.S. has seen a steady rise in congenital syphilis cases over the last 10 years. This is despite decreases in cases of chlamydia and gonorrhea, according to CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;She said that there are racial/ethnic disparities when it comes to the populations experiencing the highest rates of congenital syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"So the highest rates we're seeing are in Native Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Hispanic populations and Black populations," Wall said. "And I think it's really important to think about access to care barriers as one of the big reasons that we're seeing these increasing rates in certain populations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Barriers can include lack of insurance or lack of transportation as well as mistrust of the medical system due to past prejudices, according to Wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;How to drive down rates of congenital syphilis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Wall said half of cases are occurring among patients who are receiving prenatal care, but are missing timely and appropriate treatment, and the other half are occurring in people who are not engaged in care at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For those who are receiving prenatal care, Wall said there is a push to implement point-of-care testing, meaning testing outside of a traditional clinical laboratory, often at the patient's bedside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Delays in waiting for laboratory test results to come back and then trying to recontact the patient can lead to delays in delivering a diagnosis or administering care, Wall said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"A very exciting development to address that is the point of care syphilis testing, where you have a patient right in front of you, you're able to administer that test, get test results in 20, 30 minutes, and administer directly observed treatment right there, without sending, you know, your patient away," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For the patients who are not receiving care, Wall said it's important to work with community partners to enter underserved communities and spread awareness, as well as make sure men and women are getting tested to prevent cases from occurring in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;McDonald said that as part of an effort to eliminate syphilis from pregnancy, New York State &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/congenital_syphilis/providers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" dir="ltr"&gt;requires three syphilis screenings&lt;/a&gt; for pregnant people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"When someone's pregnant, they're supposed to be checked for syphilis three times, one when they have their first visit, the second time around the third trimester, and then the third time is where they give birth," he said. "Part of our message to health care providers is: ensure people are being screened appropriately."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He also encouraged people to practice safe sex to prevent the spread of STIs, including the use of condoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Jade A.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            
                &lt;p class="article-summary"&gt;Patient had not received the MMR vaccine&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Health officials confirmed a new case of measles Monday. A child who has been hospitalized is the state’s 17th case of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the Adams County Health Department confirmed the case in a child younger than 5 years old from Adams County, according to a press release. The child remains hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;They had not received the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. They traveled with family to Chihuahua, Mexico, where there is an ongoing measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Measles is highly contagious, but preventable. Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself, your family, and your community, health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;They gave one possible exposure location. It’s the Children’s Hospital Colorado Emergency Department in Aurora on Aug. 12, between 6:30 and 10:15 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;If exposed, symptoms could develop through Sept. 2.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;The state has now recorded 17 measles cases this year, with five recorded in residents of Arapahoe County, four in Denver and El Paso counties and one each in Adams, Archuleta, Boulder and Pueblo counties.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Five people have been hospitalized with measles this year in Colorado; no one has died.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Among Colorado’s cases, 10 are associated with an out-of-state traveler who flew while infectious.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;According to the state’s dashboard, 91.5% of Coloradans ages 1 to 18 have received at least one dose of the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;The measles vaccine is “very safe and effective,” according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity),” according to its website.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Seventeen cases is far and away more measles cases than Colorado has recorded in the last decade. In 2016, it had two cases; in each other year between 2014 and 2024, it reported either one or zero cases. In the entire decade before 2024, the state had only six confirmed measles cases total.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;The CDPHE measles webpage has information about symptoms, transmission and vaccine recommendations, 2025 Colorado measles case information and a current list of exposure locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potatoes may be a dinner staple, but they've long carried a mixed reputation—a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vegetables-to-eat-each-week-11746040" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrient-rich vegetable&lt;/a&gt; to some and a boring, unhealthy carb to others.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health analyzed about 30 years of diet and health data from more than 205,000 U.S. adults taking part in three major long-term studies—the Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. All were health care workers and healthy when the research began. Every two to four years, they filled out detailed food questionnaires that included questions on how often they ate different kinds of potatoes, from French fries to baked, boiled or mashed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over time, the team identified &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/newly-diagnosed-diabetes-8584338" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;new cases of type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; through follow-up questionnaires. They used statistical models to account for factors such as age, weight, lifestyle and overall diet so they could better isolate the role potato consumption might play in diabetes risk. They also examined how risk might change if potatoes were replaced with other carbohydrate sources.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over the course of the study, 22,299 participants developed type 2 diabetes. Those who ate more potatoes overall tended to be less active, consume more calories and have lower diet quality, with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/top-inflammatory-foods-to-limit-11779534" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;higher intakes of red meat, refined grains and sugary drinks&lt;/a&gt;. Baked, boiled or mashed potatoes were eaten much more often than French fries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After the researchers took those other lifestyle and diet factors into account, they found a clear pattern. Eating three extra servings of potatoes each week was linked to about a 5% higher rate of type 2 diabetes. The increase was much steeper for French fries, at around 20%, while baked, boiled or mashed potatoes did not show a significant change in risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When the researchers modeled different food swaps, they saw a similar pattern. Replacing three weekly servings of potatoes with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-whole-grains-for-to-improve-insulin-resistance-8424201" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt; lowered diabetes rates by about 8%. Making the same swap from fries cut the rate by about 19%. Swapping baked, boiled or mashed potatoes for whole grains resulted in a smaller 4% drop. However, replacing potatoes with white rice was linked to a higher risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s worth keeping in mind that this was an observational study, so it can’t prove that French fries directly cause type 2 diabetes. The findings show an association, meaning other unmeasured habits or health factors could still play a role in the results, even with adjustments for lifestyle and diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study isn’t telling you to give up potatoes. Instead, it’s a reminder to pay attention to how you prepare them and what you eat alongside them. Boiled, baked or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-potato-for-mashed-potatoes-according-to-chefs-8742394" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;mashed potatoes&lt;/a&gt; can be part of a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-can-spike-your-blood-sugar-11762553" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthy routine&lt;/a&gt;, especially when they’re paired with vegetables, healthy fats and protein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; French fries are best enjoyed as occasional enjoyment rather than a staple. Having them once in a while is fine, but making them a frequent part of your meals can tip the balance away from your health goals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you want to make a healthier swap, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290547/whole-grain-cooking-guide/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole grains like quinoa, farro, barley or brown rice&lt;/a&gt; are solid choices. Replacing potatoes with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047875/what-are-refined-carbs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;refined carbs&lt;/a&gt;—especially white rice—can push your risk in the opposite direction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study found that French fries, but not baked, boiled or mashed potatoes, were linked to a higher risk of type 2 diabetes—and swapping fries or total potatoes for whole grains lowered that risk. Your overall eating habits, activity level and body weight still matter more for long-term health than any single food. Potatoes can be part of a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;balanced diet&lt;/a&gt;—it’s how they’re prepared and how often you eat them that makes the difference.&lt;br&gt;

As a result, the FDA said it had notified drugmakers of its “intent to take action” against the products, but added that it wouldn't do so immediately to give patients time to switch medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bb5679" class="body-graf"&gt;“The agency urges patients taking these unapproved animal-derived thyroid medications to treat hypothyroidism to talk to their doctor,” it wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5364be" class="body-graf"&gt;The statement in and of itself was nothing surprising. Warnings about unapproved drugs are standard fare for the FDA. What followed also wasn’t unheard of: social media backlash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6fa9f4" class="body-graf"&gt;But on Wednesday evening, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary seemingly reversed course, writing in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/drmakaryfda/status/1955783788040159558?s=46"&gt;post on X that &lt;/a&gt;the FDA was committed to pursuing the first-ever approval of desiccated thyroid extract, pending results of the ongoing clinical trials. “In the mean time, we will ensure access for all Americans,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0add89" class="body-graf"&gt;Five minutes later, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. responded. “Love your approach of using gold standard science and common sense, @DrMarkaryFDA,” &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1955785019194269945?s=46"&gt;Kennedy wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ffc62" class="body-graf"&gt;So, what was this all about?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-00f8fa" class="body-heading"&gt;Animal-derived thyroid pills &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f5aa62" class="body-graf"&gt;The thyroid — a small, butterfly-shaped gland located at the front of the neck — helps regulate how the body uses energy by producing thyroid hormones. When it doesn’t produce enough, it can lead to hypothyroidism, which can cause symptoms including unexplained &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/happens-stop-taking-wegovy-ozempic-many-people-regain-weight-rcna66282" target="_blank"&gt;weight gain,&lt;/a&gt; tiredness, sensitivity to cold, changes in menstrual cycles and symptoms of depression and anxiety, according &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypothyroidism/symptoms-causes/syc-20350284"&gt;to the Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. The condition is more common in women than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a6bfff" class="body-graf"&gt;The standard treatment is prescription thyroid hormone replacement therapy — basically, taking pills that contain the needed thyroid hormones. Typically one of two synthetic hormones, levothyroxine or liothyronine, or a combination of both, are prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aa1b7a" class="body-graf"&gt;Some patients, however, turn to animal-derived thyroid pills either because they don’t respond well to the synthetic versions or want to take something marketed as natural, said Dr. Michael Weintraub, an endocrinologist at ​​NYU Langone Health in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-350ec4" class="body-graf"&gt;The pills — which aren’t FDA-approved — are made from dried thyroid glands, usually from pigs, and are sold under brand names like Armour Thyroid, NP Thyroid, Nature-Thyroid and Natural Thyroid, according to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e25719" class="body-graf"&gt;About 1.5 million people in the U.S. were prescribed animal-derived thyroid pills in 2024, the FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ee9441" class="body-graf"&gt;In the FDA statement warning against the animal-derived drugs, the agency said they may contain impurities that could result in infections and could also contain inconsistent levels of thyroid hormones, another risk for patients. Taking too much can cause unwanted effects, the FDA said, and too little could not be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-24024c" class="body-heading"&gt;The backlash&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-055410" class="body-graf"&gt;In the days that followed the FDA’s statement, patients and doctors took to social media to voice their opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7986bb" class="body-graf"&gt;“BREAKING FDA set to BAN natural desiccated thyroid medications. Millions rely on these for hypothyroidism who don’t respond well to synthetic thyroid pharmaceuticals,” &lt;a href="https://x.com/drwillcole/status/1955000605740527843"&gt;read one post from Will Cole&lt;/a&gt;, a functional medicine doctor. “Let your voice be heard. The FDA needs to change course on this one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-452c82" class="body-graf"&gt;Dave Asprey, the founder of Bulletproof Coffee, a coffee and supplement brand, &lt;a href="https://x.com/daveasprey/status/1954915041163026467?s=46"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;: “I found out I had very low thyroid levels in my mid-20s, and Hashimoto’s. Normal synthetic thyroid drugs did not work. Natural thyroid extract worked very well and I have been taking it for more than 25 years without a problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4d98fb" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Robert Malone — an &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-cdc-acip-vaccine-panel-eight-new-members-rcna212477"&gt;anti-vaccine activist who was recently appointed by Kennedy to a vaccine advisory panel&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://x.com/rwmalonemd/status/1955775248634139070?s=46&amp;amp;t=uVo2mMUKz5lRhylxUS3GKw"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; the decision “terrible news — particularly for postmenopausal women.” He called on doctors and patients to contact the FDA in response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0ed9fe" class="body-graf"&gt;Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, did not respond to a question about whether Makary’s post on Wednesday was in response to social media backlash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e57343" class="body-graf"&gt;When asked about whether the FDA would still take action against unapproved thyroid products, Nixon referred NBC News to the agency’s statement last week, which said, “FDA is not taking immediate action against manufacturers who make unapproved animal-derived thyroid medication to give patients time to transition to an FDA-approved medication to treat their hypothyroidism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e4b83" class="body-graf"&gt;Nixon added that the agency “will share additional information as it becomes available and as clinical trial results are released.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b88cde" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear which ongoing trials Makary and Nixon were referring to. &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01739972"&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/a&gt; lists a trial initiated by Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in 2012, but the trial’s status is currently marked as “unknown.” Allergan, the maker of Armour Thyroid, &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04124705"&gt;completed a trial in 2021&lt;/a&gt; comparing its product to levothyroxine, a synthetic thyroid hormone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-2b0364" class="body-heading"&gt;So, are these pills safe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6f1c78" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Pieter Cohen, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said the FDA was correct to issue its initial warning about the thyroid pills, noting that the animal-derived pills aren’t regulated by the agency and can pose significant risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d28af2" class="body-graf"&gt;The FDA-approved synthetic versions usually replace one of two thyroid hormones: T4, the main hormone the thyroid produces, or T3, the active form of T4 that helps regulate energy and metabolism. Companies that make FDA-approved drugs must follow certain regulations, including consistent dosing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2fbe87" class="body-graf"&gt;The animal-derived versions also contain the thyroid hormones, just like prescription medications, Cohen said, but because they’re unregulated, the amount they contain can be all over the place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d9977b" class="body-graf"&gt;“Getting too much or too little thyroid hormone has long-term health risks,” he said. “If you take too much, it can damage your bones, it can damage your heart. If you take too little, if you’re not getting enough, a number of problems can occur too, including mood problems, like depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d94b06" class="body-graf"&gt;Weintraub, of ​​NYU Langone Health, said that tiny changes in thyroid hormone levels can have a big impact, so it’s important to get the dosage right.

Researchers hope that human trials are just a few years away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The data have never looked so good,” says Monica Coenraads, founder and chief executive of the Rett Syndrome Research Trust in Trumbull, Connecticut. “This is less and less science fiction, and closer to reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Daunting challenge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have already developed gene-editing therapies &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01593-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01593-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;to treat diseases of the blood&lt;/a&gt;, liver and eyes. In May, researchers reported&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; a stunning success using &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01496-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01496-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;a bespoke gene-editing therapy to treat a baby boy named KJ&lt;/a&gt; with a deadly liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the brain poses special challenges. The molecular components needed to treat KJ were inserted into fatty particles that naturally accumulate in the liver. Researchers are searching for similar particles that can selectively target the brain, which is surrounded by &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01569-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01569-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;a defensive barrier that can prevent many substances from entering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01496-z" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02578-8/d41586-025-02578-8_50982848.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;World’s first personalized CRISPR therapy given to baby with genetic disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although KJ’s story was exciting, it was also frustrating for those whose family members have neurological diseases, says Coenraads, whose organization focuses on Rett syndrome, a rare disorder that affects brain development. “The question that I hear from our families is, ‘It was done so quickly for him. What’s taking us so long?’,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pool of concerned families is growing as physicians and families increasingly turn to genome sequencing to find the causes of once-mysterious brain disorders, says Cathleen Lutz, a geneticist at The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine. “People are starting to now find out that their child’s seizures, for example, are related to particular genetic mutations,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Snip and stitch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies in mice suggest that gene-editing technology, which can rewrite small snippets of a cell’s genome, is ready to correct some of these mutations. In July, researchers reported&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that they had repaired mutations that, in humans, cause a disease called alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC). The condition, which typically starts causing symptoms before a child reaches 18 months old, causes seizures, learning disabilities and episodes of partial paralysis. “It’s a horrible disease,” says David Liu, a chemical biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu and his colleagues deployed a gene-editing offshoot of CRISPR called prime editing in mice with a mutation that causes AHC. The technique corrected the mutation in about half of the brain’s cortex, a region that controls learning and memory. The mice also showed improvements in a variety of measures: their seizure-like episodes became less severe, cognition and motor control improved and lifespans lengthened. “The mouse results were dramatic,” says Liu. “We were amazed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01593-z" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02578-8/d41586-025-02578-8_51013894.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;World first: ultra-powerful CRISPR treatment trialled in a person&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu’s laboratory is also working in mice to correct mutations that cause two other neurological disorders: Huntington’s disease and Friedreich’s ataxia in people&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine in China, neuroscientist Zilong Qiu and his colleagues have used base editing to correct a mutation in a gene called &lt;i&gt;MEF2C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In human children, this mutation can cause epilepsy, intellectual disability and limited verbal ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In male mice, the same mutations alter how the rodents behave around fellow mice. Correction of the &lt;i&gt;Mef2c&lt;/i&gt; mutation by base editing, an ultra-precise version of CRISPR genome editing that corrects single DNA letters, restored normal social behaviour and improved the connections between nerve cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Mpox made for scary headlines in 2022 and 2023: tens of thousands of cases worldwide, with &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/mpox-one-year-later-where-is-the-u-s-today/" target="_blank"&gt;30,000 in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; in just one year. There were reports of painful lesions and mammoth efforts to mobilize vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2025, it seems like just a memory. Only it's not.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You see the agony the patient goes through. It's on another level," says Caroline Mugun, a nurse at an mpox isolation ward in Mombasa, Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over the past year, the virus has spread rapidly across borders in Africa. Twenty-four African countries are in the midst of mpox outbreaks — up from 13 a year ago, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For many of these countries — from Gambia to Kenya, from Uganda to South Sudan — this is the first time they've ever seen cases of mpox.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Today — Aug. 14 — marks the one-year anniversary of the World Health Organization declaring mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. This rare distinction indicates the highest level of alert. But critics say the global response has fallen dangerously short, despite the fact that $1.1 billion has been pledged by countries, foundations and international organizations to support mpox control.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here is a look at where the mpox crisis stands and what that means for future outbreaks of other serious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;"Walking blind"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Historically, mpox was associated with remote forested areas in west and central Africa. The virus was known for occasionally jumping from small wild animals to people, often children who hunted them. While it was initially called monkeypox because of lab cases in primates, the main carrier is thought to be other infected animals, like rodents. The name was changed in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the WHO rang the alarm bells a year ago, mpox had a very different profile than in its early days.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A new strain of the virus — officially called clade 1b — had just emerged and was spreading fast, particularly among sex workers and their clientele. The epicenter of this outbreak was the war-torn eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Far from the forest, this area is known for immense mineral wealth, and it attracts laborers from many of the neighboring countries. Soon, the new strain was popping up in those nearby nations: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Fast-forward a year to now, and the new strain has taken off. There have also been big outbreaks in Africa of the other mpox strain. By Africa CDC's count, there have been roughly 97,000 suspected mpox cases across the continent and nearly 600 deaths so far this year. However, mpox experts say, the numbers are likely a severe undercount.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Your case counts are kind of like shadows on a wall — they're not telling you that very precise picture," explains &lt;a href="https://ph.ucla.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/anne-rimoin" target="_blank"&gt;Anne Rimoin&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of epidemiology at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and an mpox researcher. She says there are many reasons for this, including stigma associated with a sexually transmitted disease and a large portion of affected individuals living in remote areas where there's limited surveillance and diagnostic capacity. The result is that many mpox patients are likely not getting medical care and not getting recorded in the data.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another reason for the imprecise figures is President Trump's cuts to foreign aid. The Democratic Republic of Congo was among the top recipients of U.S. foreign assistance, and some of that money went to the mpox response, including the transportation of samples from clinics to laboratories for testing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have really gone off a kind of data cliff," says &lt;a href="https://globalhealth.duke.edu/people/beyrer-chris" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Chris Beyrer&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist and director of the Duke Global Health Institute at Duke University. "We are flying blind. But since the response is so stalled, I'm not sure it's really flying. I think we're probably more like walking blind."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;What data there is suggests that the geographic reach of the virus has expanded substantially but, in recent months and weeks, the number of cases on the continent seems to be dropping. This is making &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivier-le-polain-de-waroux-95a12034/?originalSubdomain=ch" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Olivier le Polain&lt;/a&gt;, the unit head of Epidemiology and Analytics for Response at the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, optimistic. "When all the information points toward the same types of trends, it gives us some confidence that the trend is genuine," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;"Three steps backwards"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even with cases dropping, plenty of mpox specialists are raising grave concerns about the global response.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This has basically been a very frustrating year," says &lt;a href="https://med.emory.edu/departments/medicine/divisions/infectious-diseases/studies-programs/bircwh/scholars/boghuma-titanji.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Boghuma Titanji&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at Emory University. "I feel like for every two steps of progress that have been made, there have been three steps backwards."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Titanji and others can tick off a whole range of reasons for why the virus remains uncontrolled. For starters, the epicenter of the epidemic — in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo — is in the midst of a brutal conflict, with rebels in control of key cities and little medical care available. Another big issue: This outbreak has overlapped with a dramatic drop in global health aid both from the U.S. and from a number of European countries, such as France.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Mpox can certainly serve as a textbook case study on how a global health crisis unfolds and evolves when you have biological risk colliding with political and economic forces," says Rimoin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many point to vaccines as the epitome of how the response has gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mpox is a vaccine-preventable disease, and yet, to date, only about 886,000 people have been vaccinated in a dozen African countries. Just over 3 million doses have been delivered to the continent. That's according to Africa CDC, which had previously put the target at 10 million doses available by the end of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The challenges started early on: When the WHO declared the public health emergency, it still had not green-lit the mpox vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's like: 'Well, you either have an emergency or you don't,'" says Beyrer. At the time, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/09/05/g-s1-20983/mpox-vaccines-africa-congo" target="_blank"&gt;pushed back&lt;/a&gt; on the notion that anyone was moving slowly, saying WHO experts didn't have complete information with which to assess the efficacy and safety of the vaccines. "We will not take shortcuts," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. vaccine donation is an example of a pledge that failed to fully materialize. Then-President Joe Biden promised to send &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/24/nx-s1-5121426/biden-mpox-unga-ukraine-gaza-sudan-ai" target="_blank"&gt;1 million doses&lt;/a&gt; to Africa in September 2024. However, as of July 2025, only about 90,000 had made it to the continent. Of the remaining doses, about half are now too close to their expiration date to ship, according to &lt;a href="https://epicentre.msf.org/en/epicentre/team/yap-boum-ii" target="_blank"&gt;Yap Boum&lt;/a&gt;, the deputy head of Africa CDC's mpox response.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They can no longer be sent to the continent, which is a huge loss, because that one dose of vaccine is $100," Boum says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Kenya, nurse Mugun — who works for Doctors Without Borders — says people want the mpox vaccine but the country has not yet launched an immunization program.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the U.S. vaccine pledge.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;What about the future? &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mpox researchers and doctors say the lackluster global response portends poorly for mpox's future potential as well as other disease threats.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Titanji of Emory University worries that the lack of response may undercut the value of the WHO alert system. Same with Africa CDC's emergency declaration, which marked the first time the body ever issued a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security. "If we have had the highest level of alert for 12 months on a particular emergency and that hasn't really put a dent in the containment, how impactful is this lever?" she asks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://africacdc.org/people/dr-jean-kaseya/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jean Kaseya&lt;/a&gt;, director-general of Africa CDC, disagrees with the suggestion that not much has happened to contain mpox. "Africa didn't have this capacity. It's now that we are building capacity," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He pointed out that a year ago, no African country had granted regulatory approval for the mpox vaccine that the U.S. was hoping to send. Now, 17 countries have approved it. Similarly, he says, the laboratory network used to test suspected mpox cases has grown significantly in the hot spots. For example, Burundi had two labs capable of testing mpox a year ago and now has 56.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Plus, he adds, this is the first time there has been coordination and collaboration across the continent with an African body helping to lead the charge and fairly allocate resources. Kaseya argues that without the emergency declaration, the resources that have been pledged would not have materialized. Still, he acknowledges, there is a lot more work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Titanji agrees there is more work to do. She warns that the world is watching in real time as the virus becomes entrenched in the human population. "The virus will evolve the more opportunities that it is given," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rimoin says that so far in this mpox emergency, the U.S. has been largely spared — but that may not last. "Diseases we ignore abroad can quickly land on our doorstep," she says. "We've been lucky so far. I don't know how long our luck will hold out."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

According to the report, the man had no prior psychiatric history when he arrived at the hospital "expressing concern that his neighbor was poisoning him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He reported that he had been distilling his own water at home and appeared paranoid about the water he was offered. After lab tests and consultation with poison control, doctors found high levels of bromide in the body, as reported by NBC News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the first 24 hours of admission, he expressed increasing paranoia and auditory and visual hallucinations, which, after attempting to escape, resulted in an involuntary psychiatric hold for grave disability," the case report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once stabilized, the man revealed that he had conducted a "personal experiment" to eliminate table salt from his diet after reading about its potential health risks. He said he had consulted ChatGPT before making the change, which he followed for three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physicians did not have access to the man’s exact ChatGPT conversation logs. However, when they asked ChatGPT 3.5 what chloride could be replaced with, the AI suggested bromide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Though the reply stated that context matters, it did not provide a specific health warning, nor did it inquire about why we wanted to know, as we presume a medical professional would do," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a prior statement to Fox News, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/openai" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;OpenAI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; the parent company has emphasized that the chatbot is not intended for treating any health condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have safety teams working on reducing risks and have trained our AI systems to encourage people to seek professional guidance," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report noted that bromide toxicity was more common in the early 1900s, when bromide salts were found in over-the-counter medications and sedatives and accounted for about 8% of psychiatric admissions. Today, bromide is primarily used in veterinary medicine as an anti-epileptic treatment for cats and dogs, according to the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report said the syndrome is rare, but cases have recently re-emerged because bromide-containing substances have become more widely available online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 20:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>新的血压指南建议提前开始治疗和不喝酒- yahoo.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxOd0ZaMHhveHJPVEktM29oblNRbDhQNUJHSVUxTFBkUzZQb28zdnVhR2hNSUhQWWFJbTFLaXNoVVp5RXNCNzVWdW91NHk4UTZyWDY4QTk0MEdFWGZmeXJ3YVpVTTRjdFU4YU56a2hiSVBUMklhVDF4aUtBbTV6OHdkcTNPVVU4QWNoYlRFVGNvcGVBbmNxRkdfcmhCUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The next time you get your blood pressure checked, expect your medical provider to be a bit more aggressive about high levels. And if you like a glass of wine with dinner or a cocktail on the weekends, brace yourself: New guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/guidelines/high-blood-pressure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:released Thursday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;released Thursday&lt;/a&gt; suggest you abstain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Committees from the heart organizations continuously assess the latest research so they can help medical providers figure out the best approach to &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, but this is the first new set of guidelines since 2017. Heart disease has long been the No. 1 killer in the world and blood pressure is one of the most easily modifiable ways to avoid such a death. Keeping your blood pressure in check can also reduce your risk of kidney disease, type 2 diabetes and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nearly half of all adults in the US have higher than normal blood pressure. The goal numbers for adults haven’t changed, according to the guidelines: Normal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg, elevated blood pressure is 120-129/80 mm Hg. If you are at 130/80 mmHg or higher, according to the new guidelines, your medical provider will want you to make some changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury, which is abbreviated as mm Hg. The measurement has an upper number, or systolic reading, and a lower number, a diastolic reading: Systolic pressure measures the force of blood as it pumps out of the heart into the arteries, and diastolic is the pressure created as the heart rests between beats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;High blood pressure doesn’t have any symptoms typically. But when your blood pressure is high, the force of your blood pushes against the walls of your blood vessels, making your heart less efficient, so both the vessels and heart must work harder. Without treatment, high blood pressure will eventually damage your arteries, raising your risk of having a heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;How high blood pressure is treated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The new blood pressure guidelines say that if your systolic blood pressure is in the 130 to 139 range, your medical provider should first encourage you to adopt healthy lifestyle changes. After three to six months, if the lifestyle changes alone don’t lower your blood pressure to the goal range, then medication is recommended, the new guidelines say. That’s a shift from 2017 recommendation that anyone with systolic blood pressure above 140 should be prescribed lifestyle changes and medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“So just trying to more aggressively control blood pressure, for it to be better for more people, to prevent cardiovascular disease, strokes, kidney disease, and now we know lowering blood pressure actually helps reduce the risk for dementia as well. So that’s really big news out of this guideline,” said Dr. Daniel Jones, American Heart Association chair of the writing committee for the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Lifestyle changes, according to the new guidelines, include maintaining or achieving a healthy weight, eating a heart-healthy diet, reducing the amount of salt in what you eat and drink, managing stress, at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week and resistance exercise like weight training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There’s another shift from 2017: The new guidelines also recommend forgoing alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The guidelines used to say that if people chose to drink, it should be one drink or less a day for women, and two or less a day for men. Jones said there’s just too much evidence now that alcohol negatively impacts your blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“A lot of people enjoy drinking, but because the evidence is there, we want you to make an informed decision,” said Jones, who is also dean and professor emeritus of the University of Mississippi School of Medicine. “There’s a lot of individual variability with the relationship between alcohol and blood pressure, but we put forward the ideal as abstinence, and for those who choose to drink, less than one for women and less than two for men.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Based on a growing body of evidence, there’s also more emphasis on how important it is to lower blood pressure to reduce the risk of developing dementia, Jones said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With more studies about women having trouble with &lt;a href="https://www.goredforwomen.org/en/mom-life/for-moms-with-babies-and-toddlers/expert-advice-about-high-blood-pressure-and-pregnancy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure during pregnancy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;high blood pressure during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;, Jones said, the guidelines also newly emphasize how important it is for people who want to become pregnant or those who are pregnant to monitor their blood pressure. High blood pressure can hurt the pregnancy and can raise a person’s risk of having elevated blood pressure even long after pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dietary recommendations still include the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan#:~:text=Description%20of%20the%20DASH%20Eating,sugar%2Dsweetened%20beverages%20and%20sweets" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DASH diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DASH diet &lt;/a&gt;which is a diet high on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oils and and low on fat, sugar, and tropical oils like coconut and palm oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We also harp on sodium again and we know salt and alcohol are favorites for lots of people, but we do recommend limiting salt intake, increasing potassium intake,” Jones said. One easy way to do that is if cooking at home to use potassium-enriched salt substitutes. Sodium intake should be less than 2,300 mg per day, moving toward a more ideal limit of 1,500 mg per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For people with overweight or obesity, the guidelines recommend losing at least 5% of body weight. For people with more severe obesity, the guidelines recommend what Jones says are clinically proven interventions: diet and exercise, and weight loss medications &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/13901-glp-1-agonists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:including GLP-1s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;including GLP-1s&lt;/a&gt;. For people with very severe obesity, the guidelines also suggest surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Jones said he knows it can be difficult for people to keep their blood pressure in check, but taking these steps can help a person’s health significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The reality is the first line of things we recommend for both prevention and treatment of high blood pressure have to do with eating and we live in a very difficult environment for food. It’s hard for people to have a low sodium intake. It’s hard for people to eat enough potassium. It’s hard for people to take in a small number of calories, but the good news is that all that stuff works if you’re willing to do it,” Jones said. “It’s hard, but it works.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 20:29:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxOd0ZaMHhveHJPVEktM29oblNRbDhQNUJHSVUxTFBkUzZQb28zdnVhR2hNSUhQWWFJbTFLaXNoVVp5RXNCNzVWdW91NHk4UTZyWDY4QTk0MEdFWGZmeXJ3YVpVTTRjdFU4YU56a2hiSVBUMklhVDF4aUtBbTV6OHdkcTNPVVU4QWNoYlRFVGNvcGVBbmNxRkdfcmhCUQ</guid></item><item><title>自1991年以来，爱达荷州东部居民首次确诊麻疹病例- East Idaho News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxOOWxMWDFsdFRLaW45M2tURXYtU09vNmRfWHhJODFOYXVUTHA4U1RLUXNFTlRlSDVGRXRtTXJCQmRNcmVSbjNqS2hjT0FjbXlROEFFTTk1eWg4UU5kLTF3SHpwSnY3b1Uxb09qR0pDNVFHb2JqaUh3V0VSTl9ubW9rNlJFX2JDNy1yWnNqTXlkaVMwaVVxUVhQeEFxVTdMdkQ5VUp0Q0E2bw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleText"&gt; &lt;p&gt;IDAHO FALLS – Eastern Idaho Public Health reported a second local case of measles in Bonneville County on Thursday.
