Despite its prevalence, early-stage CRC frequently remains asymptomatic, or manifests through subtle gastrointestinal changes that are easily attributed to benign causes. According to a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2819248" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study in JAMA Network&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, some symptoms are associated with early-onset colorectal cancer.

Pencil thin or narrow stool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sudden and persistent shift to thin, ribbon-like, or pencil-thin stools could be a red flag. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/signs-and-symptoms.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, a change in stool caliber that lasts more than a few days may indicate a tumour narrowing the passage. Physiologically, as per &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/in-depth/colon-cancer-stool/art-20586915" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, when a tumour grows on the inner wall of the colon or rectum, it can constrict the space through which stool passes, leading to thinner stools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2. Mucus in the stool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intestines naturally produce a small amount of mucus to lubricate the colon lining. But a noticeable increase in slime or jelly-like substance coating stool can be a warning sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical guidelines from &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279199/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;NCBI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;also list “bleeding or secreting mucus” from the back passage as one of the signs to monitor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Blood in stool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of blood in stool, either bright red or dark, tarry, is one of the most recognized early warning signs of colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/in-depth/colon-cancer-stool/art-20586915" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Clinical studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; indicate that up to 50–60% of early-stage CRC patients present with some form of rectal bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, while hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and gastrointestinal infections can also cause bleeding, persistent or recurrent blood in stool, especially when accompanied by other CRC warning signs, warrants immediate medical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4.

                                        &lt;p&gt;GRAYS HARBOR COUNTY, Wash. (AP) — A Washington state resident is believed to be the first person to die from a &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-infection-washington-h5n5-b8921d13aa7d96330654a960f80453c3"&gt;rare strain of bird flu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but state health officials said Friday the risk to the public is low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person, an older adult with underlying health conditions, was being treated for a bird flu called H5N5 after becoming seemingly the first known human infected by the strain, according to a statement from the Washington State Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person from Grays Harbor County, about 78 miles (125 kilometers) southwest of Seattle, had a backyard flock of domestic poultry that had been exposed to wild birds, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The risk to the public remains low,” the statement from state health officials said. “No other people involved have tested positive for avian influenza.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said they will monitor anyone who came in close contact with the person, but “there is no evidence of transmission of this virus between people.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a statement about the infection that said no information would suggest “the risk to public health has increased as a result of this case.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;H5N5 is not believed to be a greater threat to human health than the H5N1 virus behind a wave of 70 reported human infections in the U.S. in 2024 and 2025. Most of those have been mild illnesses in workers on dairy and poultry farms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distinction between H5N5 and H5N1 lies in a protein involved in releasing the virus from an infected cell and promoting spread to surrounding cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story has been corrected to remove references stating the person who died was a man. Officials have not released the person’s gender.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;

Kennedy Jr. said in an interview with the New York Times that he personally instructed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to change its long-standing position that vaccines do not cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countering decades of science showing vaccines to be safe, the public health agency's website was changed to say, "The claim 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the interview, Kennedy said that while the large-scale epidemiological studies of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine had found no link to autism, and that studies of the mercury-based preservative thimerosal had also shown no link, there are gaps in the vaccine safety science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The whole thing about 'vaccines have been tested and there's been this determination made,' is just a lie," Kennedy said in his first interview with a major print publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is a longtime vaccine skeptic and not a scientist. Before he took up his role as head of Health and Human Services, the CDC was a key opponent of growing global anti-vaccine sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The phrase 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not supported by science," Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts, doctors and scientists have decried &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51408073" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;the update&lt;/a&gt; as the kind of misinformation the CDC has fought for decades as it promoted the use of lifesaving childhood vaccines both in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization and other health agencies around the world have repeatedly said evidence shows vaccines do not cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many large-scale studies in hundreds of thousands of children across the world have thoroughly investigated the claim that vaccines cause autism and found no link between vaccines and autism. Based on existing evidence, vaccines do not cause autism," the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the interview, Kennedy said he ordered the CDC to change its guidance in part because high-quality large studies had not been conducted to examine a potential link between autism and other shots given in the first year of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those include the hepatitis B vaccine and a combination shot that protects against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A revamped committee that advises the CDC on vaccine policy is scheduled to meet early next month to consider new recommendations for hepatitis B vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also said he had spoken with Sen. Bill Cassidy, who disagreed with the decision, about the website changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

According to a &lt;a class="link" href="https://doh.wa.gov/newsroom/grays-harbor-county-resident-tests-preliminarily-positive-avian-influenza" target="_blank"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt; from Grays Harbor County health officials last week, the person was considered “older” and had underlying health conditions. Their symptoms included a high fever, confusion and trouble breathing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person had a backyard flock consisting of mixed domestic poultry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing by the health department found virus in the “environment of the flock ... making exposure to the domestic poultry, their environment, or wild birds the most likely source of exposure for this patient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at the state’s health department said they were monitoring other people who were exposed to the flock and environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular strain of bird flu, H5N5, had never been seen in a person before. It appeared first in 2023, infecting birds and mammals in eastern Canada. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(24)00808-8" target="_blank"&gt;research published last year&lt;/a&gt; on the novel strain, some infected animals carried a key mutation in the virus that allows it to transfer more easily between mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epidemiologists and virologists worry that avian influenza could generate a pandemic if allowed to spread and mutate. For instance, the H5N1 virus circulating in dairy cattle in North America &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-12-05/just-one-mutation-can-make-h5n1-a-threat-to-humans"&gt;is one mutation away&lt;/a&gt; from being able to spread easily between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time a bird flu virus infects a person, concerns grow that it could change, becoming more transmissible or more deadly. For instance, if a sickened person also has another flu virus replicating in their body, there’s concern the viruses could exchange genetic material. Just by having an opportunity to replicate and evolve millions of times in the human body, it could acquire deadly mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the risk to the public remains low and that no other people involved have tested positive for avian influenza. They say there is no evidence of transmission of the virus between people, but they are monitoring anyone who was in close contact with the patient.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 02:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNY184WXQweVc4Uk9IUHl1MzhBaTVubTBmRUs2QTNPZ2ZBSmFaNmdhTnh5bDZiaTBEWW1ZeHRjZU5JU1JkVFdUSXhLOFhpbEI4Zi1zc3dpbFFTN1FyenVRTF9XLTVHdGZZY2pqV00zZTRQaEhhT2xPeGdLVTJHY0FLaGJJN2RoZDBqbV9YbzZmLU9yczZBSzl5QVNER3dIVXNJX2UwZ3Ixc0VuaDlm</guid></item><item><title>华盛顿居民死于人类从未报告过的禽流感病毒并发症- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/21/health/washington-bird-flu-death</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            A Washington resident died of complications from an infection with a bird flu strain never before reported in humans, the state Department of Health said on Friday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9mldq900083b6qgyj2dqqp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The patient was an older adult with underlying health conditions who had been hospitalized and undergoing treatment for infection with H5N5 avian influenza.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9mldq900093b6q0mu8mpw2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s the first reported case of bird flu in a human in the US in nine months and only the second reported human death from the virus in the United States, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that the risk to the general public from the virus remains low.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9mldq9000a3b6qsu6ummey@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Officials continue to monitor others who were in close contact with the person, but no one else has tested positive for bird flu, and no evidence of human-to-human transmission has been found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9mldq9000b3b6qvuzxqja6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The person had a backyard flock of mixed domestic birds,” the Washington State Department of Health said in &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/newsroom/grays-harbor-county-resident-dies-complications-avian-influenza" target="_blank"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “DOH sampling identified avian influenza virus in the environment of the flock, making exposure to the domestic poultry, their environment, or wild birds the most likely source of exposure for this patient.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9mldq9000c3b6q3fi93x27@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bird flu has been infecting wild birds around the world for decades, but the latest US outbreak started in January 2022 and has featured more spread among mammals than in past years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9mldq9000d3b6quizvx8rq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Seventy other human cases of bird flu have been reported in the US as part of the outbreak, according to the CDC. Another elderly person with underlying conditions died in January after a bird flu infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9mldq9000e3b6q4ia8sboo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although a handful of cases have been severe, most people who have been infected have had mild illness, the CDC said, with symptoms like red eyes and fever.  The majority of those who have caught bird flu work closely with animals. There have been 41 cases in people who work with cattle and 24 cases among poultry workers. Two other cases have had some other animal exposure that the CDC does not list, and in three cases, the exposure was unknown.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9mldq9000f3b6qa6ajnuy7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC recommends that anyone who works closely with animals wear appropriate protective equipment and use caution around animal feces.  Officials also advise using caution when cleaning bird feeders or other areas exposed to bird feces. Avoid contact with sick or dead wildlife.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9mldq9000g3b6qnakkdg1i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Washington health department also recommends flu shots for anyone who may come into contact with domestic or wild birds. Although the regular influenza vaccine can’t protect against bird flu, it reduces the slight chance that someone could get sick with both viruses at once and cause the bird flu virus to mutate into something that would spread easily among humans.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

"But that's because the body thinks an infection might be coming, so cells move into the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Within hours the levels go back to normal so your body hasn't created any more white blood cells." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Professor Riley adds that part of the benefit of cold water swimming comes from building a social connection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Feeling "brighter, more alert and more connected" has real physiological effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Professor John Tregoning, a vaccine immunologist, says the benefits are mostly indirect and much of what makes people feel healthier in winter may come down to stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It reduces stress because you're outdoors with nice people in nice places. But you could get the same from dancing, singing or going for a run."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Being in nature can lower your blood pressure and stress hormones that can dampen immune responses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;GP Dr Margaret McCartney explains that moderate exercise does show evidence of reducing viral infections, but that could be any form of exercise, not just cold water swimming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Kombucha: Interesting but little evidence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d78f/live/c27a67e0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d78f/live/c27a67e0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d78f/live/c27a67e0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d78f/live/c27a67e0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d78f/live/c27a67e0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d78f/live/c27a67e0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d78f/live/c27a67e0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d78f/live/c27a67e0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Young woman drinking a refreshing beverage from a plastic bottle " class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Many people turn to fermented drinks like kombucha which promises to boost the microbiome and, by extension, the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But Dr McCartney remains cautious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"There are lots of theories about why a diverse microbiome is good, but we don't have strong enough real-world evidence to recommend kombucha to patients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Professor Tregoning adds that while it's true that the microbiome changes during infections, it usually returns to its previous state afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr McCartney says while drinks like kombucha present "interesting ideas about the role of the microbiome", there isn't a clear link with how it can help boost your immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Supplements: Just expensive urine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c0dc/live/c553c6a0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c0dc/live/c553c6a0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c0dc/live/c553c6a0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c0dc/live/c553c6a0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c0dc/live/c553c6a0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c0dc/live/c553c6a0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c0dc/live/c553c6a0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c0dc/live/c553c6a0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Woman's hand holding colorful pills against terracotta table background with shadows from home plant.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Many people in the UK remain deficient in Vitamin D and Professor Tregoning suggests that winter sunlight and getting outdoors can help.

vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Professor Riley recommends the flu jab which takes from seven to 10 days after the jab to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;While you can't boost your immune system in the dramatic way winter wellness trends often promise, the experts advise supporting it by avoiding smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, finding a regular sleep routine and doing any activity that helps reduce stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr McCartney says you can also reduce your risk of colds by being in

							&lt;/svg&gt;
						&lt;/button&gt;
						
					&lt;/p&gt;

					
						&lt;p&gt;
New findings presented at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions
are highlighting new efforts to prevent heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nishant Shah, an American Heart Association volunteer and
associate professor of medicine at Duke University Medical Center, said this
year’s conference showcases “groundbreaking technologies” with a growing focus
on stopping heart disease before it starts.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“One of the studies I was excited to see was called the
Vesalius-CV trial. That was looking at the impact of a novel cholesterol
lowering medication,” said Shah. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The medication is already on the market, but researchers
tested it in people who have not yet had a heart attack or stroke. Shah
explained it’s a population group that doesn’t typically get this aggressive treatment
up front.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The physician shared the trial found “profound reductions”
in cardiovascular events within these patients.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Shah noted the study reinforces the importance of
identifying cardiovascular risk at every stage, including before someone has had
an event. Prevention efforts also focused on managing obesity, hypertension,
and lifestyle factors, which are all contributing factors to rising rates of heart
attacks in young patients.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“There are many reasons why younger people are getting heart
attacks,” said Shah. “We need to be proactive rather than reactive. The science
is moving in that direction and discovering drugs or strategies to lower risk
to avoid early onset heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;AHA sessions also featured new gene-editing technologies for
cholesterol and alternative forms of available cholesterol therapies, aimed at
better prevention. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Other research looked at whether a daily cup of coffee might
prevent abnormal heart rhythms from returning after treatment, but doctors
caution additional studies are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“A lot of these studies are early in the investigational phases,
so we can’t jump the gun too much. We still need to get more data, understand
the methodology of these studies, and understand how it will move the clinical
needle forward,” advised Shah. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;For his patients, Shah’s message is simple: there’s exciting
science in the pipeline, but it needs to be personalized. The physician
encourages patients to review their individual risk of cardiovascular disease
with their providers to see how these findings might apply to them. &lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. flu season is starting slowly, and it’s unclear if it will be as bad as &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/us-flu-season-cdc-a640e8fe0bffa4a8f6bdbd7ea8e5608a"&gt;last winter’s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but some health experts are worried as U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data posted Friday shows a new version of the virus has emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An early analysis suggests current vaccines may still be somewhat effective against the new version of the flu, which has been the main driver of recent infections, CDC data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some scientists and medical professionals are more worried about disappointing vaccination rates, a main reason why flu hospitalizations and deaths were unusually bad during last year’s flu season — one of the deadliest this century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think we’re going to see a really severe season,” said Asefeh Faraz Covelli of the George Washington University School of Nursing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last winter, the overall flu hospitalization rate was the highest seen since the H1N1 flu pandemic 15 years ago. Flu was the underlying or a contributing cause of more than 18,000 deaths, and one seven-day stretch early this year saw more than 1,800 deaths — the highest one-week spike in at least a decade. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/flu-deaths-children-cdc-e79b1e4169d629ad4bc1095d95d82110"&gt;Child flu deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; also were far higher than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;CDC &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/usmap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; posted Friday showed low flu activity so far, with only one state — Louisiana — reporting moderate activity. Most of the reported infections have been in children, said the CDC’s Alicia Budd, who tracks flu infections for the Atlanta-based agency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most also have been a new version of the type A H3N2 virus that historically has caused the most hospitalizations and deaths in older people. That type is responsible for most flu infections so far this year, and more than half have been a new subclade K variant that is different from the strain this year’s flu shots were built to fight.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;A preliminary &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/691349457a0ccd6a3aad7fa9/_Flu_interimVE_2526_.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from the United Kingdom suggests the shots do provide at least partial protection, although it will take some time for scientists to know exactly how effective they are. Experts say any protection that softens the blow of a flu infection is important to get.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Flu seasons tend to get bad between December and February, and illnesses likely will accelerate as people travel and gather for Thanksgiving, Covelli said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s going to start picking up here,” she said. “This is the ideal time to get vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers this year have been facing an unusual struggle to get a handle on how respiratory infection and vaccination rates have been trending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They usually rely on the CDC for data, but a recent government shutdown halted data collection and reporting just as respiratory infections started ramping up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, government efforts to promote disease-preventing shots have been more limited since U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was put in charge of the CDC and other federal health agencies. Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist, has fostered uncertainty about the safety of vaccines, including flu shots that contained a preservative called &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-flu-vaccine-thimerosal-c5696bbc19f345323153d5336cb5e798"&gt;thimerosal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, vaccination rates against COVID-19 clearly continue to plummet, with about 6% of children and 14% of adults up to date on their shots, according to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/vaccination-trends.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;other CDC data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; posted Friday. Each figure is about 3 percentage points less than it was at this point last fall.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;For the flu, vaccination trends are a little muddier. Some sources have suggested flu vaccinations are down. Over two million fewer flu shots were given at U.S. pharmacies through the end of October compared to last year, according to data from IQVIA, a health information and research company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the latest CDC data indicates that for children, the vaccination rate this year is about the same as it was at this point last fall, at 34%. And the vaccination rate for adults is up a few percentage points to about 37%, according to the CDC data, which relies on survey information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is early in the season and too early to know if the increase will be sustained or what is causing it, CDC officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of the beginning of November, the U.S. flu hospitalization rate is about the same as it was at the same point in 2024. Hospitalization rates for COVID-19 and another respiratory virus, RSV, are lower so far this season, according to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/resp-net/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;another set&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

&lt;p&gt;Miliary tuberculosis (MTB) is a severe form of tuberculosis in which the instigating bacteria— &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; or potentially a relative that infects cows and deer, &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium bovis&lt;/em&gt;—spread widely through the body and create small lesions. The name “miliary” dates back to 1700, when a physician noted that the specks resembled millet seeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium&lt;/em&gt; can spread through the air and are often found in the lungs, the bacteria can strike anywhere in the body. Still, penile tuberculosis is exceedingly rare. In fact, it’s uncommon to have tuberculosis erupt anywhere in the urinary and genital tracts. Among the infections that spring up in the region, penile infections account for less than 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, given the man’s lungs and his immunosuppressed status, the unusual presentation became their leading guess—and tests soon confirmed it. &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium &lt;/em&gt;were identified in the man’s respiratory tract, and penile tissue tested also showed the bacteria, though the testing couldn’t identify what species of &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment for tuberculosis requires a regimen of several antibiotics and takes months. In the man’s case, they customized his treatment with a 12-month, four-drug regimen that wouldn’t interfere with his transplant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the penile lesion got worse before it got better. He developed a large necrotic ulceration on the side of his penis, and his foreskin began to “break down.” Surgeons had to mechanically cut out the dead tissue. After 10 months, his infection appeared to have cleared, and his penile lesion had improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unexplained exposure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear how the man got the infection. He told doctors he wasn’t aware of coming in contact with any tuberculosis patients and wasn’t in settings where the bacteria normally spread, such as prisons.

This conclusion is supported by leading health authorities, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the California Department of Public Health, the World Health Organization, and leading research institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The increase in autism diagnoses reflects improved screening, broader diagnostic criteria, and greater awareness – not a link to vaccines. The spread of this harmful myth stigmatizes members of the autism community and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 22:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9JSG1vZ1l3R25uU3o4dWtrN0xlZHFlOFFDSmNPTXZUSXg3LV9PMEc5TE5ROHdKZkFnQkFNTFhEYV9OTmdHV2l5bzFoNE5PZjUyckI2N19HM0xUc29UcW9iVU9OMDBqTzlqT3l0TmdYcWI5LU5qbmk2TVV2X2N1Zw</guid></item><item><title>减肥注射的危险和更好的替代方案- KSL.com</title><link>https://www.ksl.com/article/51408978/weight-loss-shots-research-indicates-dangers-from-starting-and-stopping</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both starting and stopping this drug can be dangerous. Not only is the research clear about this but Dr. Roberts DC, at &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Heath Utah&lt;/a&gt;, is on the front lines helping prevent and resolve side effects. He reports seeing some of the problems patients are experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such case involved a 16-year-old girl. Roberts says, "She came into my clinic with excruciating pain. She couldn't even drink water without severe abdominal distress. Even though she was on Semaglutide for only a short time, the pain persisted for six months after she stopped injecting it. That's when she came to see me. Fortunately with care, her pain resolved within a few weeks. Incredibly she lost no weight throughout the whole ordeal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients aren't so lucky. Their symptoms are more severe or longer lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: N F/peopleimages.com/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Serious side effects of starting GLP-1 Agonists&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/09/health/report-ozempic-and-other-weight-loss-drugs-linked-to-162-us-deaths/#:~:text=Weight%20loss%20shots%20like%20Ozempic,over%20the%20past%20six%20months" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; in the New York Post, since 2018, a total of 10,000 serious or life-threatening reactions have been reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database (FAERS).  And sadly, medical professionals and manufacturers have reported that these shots were a factor in 162 deaths. The number of these deaths rose by an astonishing 40% over a recent six month period as more and more people started using them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts says, "The reality is that the risk of death while taking these drugs is probably no greater than many other very common drugs. This just underscores the general principle that there are inherent risks in taking any kind of medication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9192250/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;1997 study&lt;/a&gt; unfortunately found that, more often than not, doctors fail to tell their patients about the risks. So Roberts encourages patients to take on the responsibility of informing themselves, weighing the risks and considering all their options before taking a drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a618008.html#:~:text=Semaglutide%20injection%20may%20increase%20the,swallowing;%20or%20shortness%20of%20breath" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Semaglutide label&lt;/a&gt; lists the following potential side effects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pancreatitis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thyroid tumors, including cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Severe gastrointestinal disease such as stomach paralysis and intestinal blockage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bloating, severe constipation, nausea, and vomiting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acute kidney injury.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hypoglycemia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gallbladder disease including Gallstones and inflammation of the gallbladder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allergic reactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vision changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rapid or pounding heartbeat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suicidal behavior and ideation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recent studies have found other concerning side effects not listed on the label. The following represent a couple of these studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38937282/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; reported in the journal, Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, up to 60% of weight lost on Liraglutide is lean muscle mass, which can weaken physical function and slow metabolism. "That means that for every three pounds you lose, almost two of them could be from muscle," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2025 population study&lt;/a&gt; reported in JAMA Ophthalmology found there is approximately a threefold increased risk of a sudden vision loss called non-arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/clinical-trials-may-not-differentiate-data-show-women-more-2025a1000lb2?form=fpf" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2025 article&lt;/a&gt; in Medscape reported FAERS analysis found incidences of anosmia, (loss of smell), dysgeusia (altered taste), tinnitus (ringing in the ears), dysphonia (voice changes), hearing disabilities and gastroesophageal reflux disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Kyrylo Ryzhov/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stopping GLP-1 Agonists: Brace for weight regain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're thinking about stopping GLP-1 agonists, be prepared for what's likely to happen. Research published in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism showed that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35441470/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;327 participants in the study&lt;/a&gt; regained two thirds of their weight within a year after discontinuing the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537024000543" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;research published in Sciencedirect&lt;/a&gt; showed that the weight people regain after the shots has a higher fat-to-muscle ratio, leading to a lowered metabolic rate and increased metabolic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyone coming off these drugs must understand this near-certain outcome if they want to prevent it," Roberts says. "If people coming off the medications will treat the drugs as a jump start to optimal health and weight, rather than the means to it and then take certain steps, they can maintain the weight loss and continue to lose weight if necessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to maintain weight loss after the shots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first step is to accept the fact that there is no short cut to optimal health and weight," Roberts says. "The laws of health cannot be circumvented with any kind of medication. You may have lost some weight with the shots, but it will all come back with a vengeance unless you adhere to those laws."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second step is to identify any underlying health issues that may be causing your stubborn weight or contributing to conditions that cause it. "Depression, insomnia, hormone imbalances, bad bacteria in the gut, liver/gallbladder problems, insulin resistance, leptin resistance, toxins and deficiencies can all contribute to both weight gain and stubborn weight," Roberts says. &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;At Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;, it is the first order of business to identify these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each patient undergoes a specialized non-invasive body scan. The scan is a functional state assessment of the body which provides an immediate overview of the patient's physiology, stress, fatigue, risk factors, and potential underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to every appointment at Health Utah, patients fill out a proprietary questionnaire that also can identify these underlying problems. The questionnaire is the result of Roberts' 30 years of experience and research. There is almost always a perfect correlation between the results of the scan and the questionnaire. Roberts uses both of these to guide him through a 40-minute consultation and evaluation with each patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third step is to address all underlying health conditions through a customized protocol of care. A care plan can include therapies, supplementation, hypnotherapy, coaching and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final step is to create a customized, healthy and sustainable food plan. Roberts says, "The shots work partially because they reduce the calories you eat. But the shots ultimately fail, like almost every other diet, precisely because they reduce the calories you eat. Calorie reduction never works long term because your body's metabolism slows down when threatened by reduced calories."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Health Utah they don't cut calories, count calories, count macros or points. They don't have you cut out whole categories of food like carbs. They don't tell you to eat all meat or all fat or give you any other faddish diet. They customized your food plan according to your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Take these steps and you will likely be able to maintain the weight you lost while on the shots and get healthier at the same time, something the shots could never do," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Special offer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any health or weight loss journey, it is essential to have the help of family and friends. In a British study, researchers found that both men and women had almost twice as much success losing weight when they did it with a partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; is offering this, their most popular weight loss package, for $59 for two people. You and a friend can get tested, receive a 17-page report, take the proprietary survey and get a consultation with Dr. Roberts. The scan alone is normally $300 for one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call (801) 609-3478 or visit &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; today to schedule your appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The opinions and conclusions expressed in this article are the sponsor's own and do not reflect the views or opinions of KSL.com.

Using functional MRI, scientists found that overly sensitive children show reduced activation in outward-facing sensory and motor networks while increasing activation in inward-focused networks tied to cognition and impulse control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This compensatory shift appears to help them manage emotional overload but also contributes to strong behavioral reactions. The results suggest that understanding each child’s unique neural pattern could guide more personalized and effective sensory therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Neural Pattern:&lt;/strong&gt; Over-responsive children display reduced sensory–motor network activity paired with heightened inward-focused cognitive network activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opposite in Less Sensitive Kids:&lt;/strong&gt; Children who are not overwhelmed show the reverse activation pattern, indicating different neural strategies for processing input.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Mapping these patterns may help clinicians tailor sensory interventions for children with sensory-induced emotional and behavioral challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the search for a way to measure different forms of a condition called sensory processing disorder, neuroscientists are using imaging to see how young brains process sensory stimulation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, investigators at UC San Francisco have found a distinctive pattern for overwhelm in some children who are overly sensitive to sound, touch, and visual information. The finding could one day help clinicians refine treatments for kids who have strong emotional and behavioral reactions, such as tantrums, to their sensory environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensory processing disorder affects how the brain understands and responds to sensory information but still lacks an official medical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), appears in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neurodevelopmental Disorders&lt;/em&gt; on Nov. 21, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at UCSF studied 83 neurodivergent children between the ages of 8 and 12 years old. About half were highly sensitive to certain noises, lights, or tactile sensations, while the other half weren’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When scientists imaged their brains using functional MRI, which measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood oxygenation levels, they found significant differences between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For over-responsive children, the activity in brain networks that govern so-called “outward” functions, such as motor skills and sensation, was low, while the activity in brain networks that regulate “inward” functions, like cognition and impulse control, was high. This was exactly opposite of the pattern that scientists observed in the less sensitive children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think that when you are overstimulated by sensory input, you compensate by dialing up your brain’s inward-focused networks to gain self-control. You also dial down your outward-focused networks to minimize sensory input,” said Pratik Mukherjee, MD, PhD, a UCSF neuroradiology professor and co-senior author of the study with Elysa Marco, MD, a pediatric neurologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The kids who aren’t emotionally overwhelmed by the input — some are even under-responsive to it — do the opposite.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past research indicates 5% to 12% of children in the U.S. have sensory processing challenges, and this may explain much of the emotional volatility in the school-age population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment for over-responsive children often focuses on gradually exposing them to sensory input over time so they learn to tolerate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mukherjee said the team’s findings could help improve these therapies: “If we know an individual child’s brain patterns and how that maps to emotion and behavior, we may be able to use this to personalize treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt; The National Institutes of Health (5R01MH116950‐04).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1763761641408"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What brain pattern marks children who are overwhelmed by sensory input?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Lower activity in outward sensory–motor networks and higher activity in inward cognitive-control networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1763761643406"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How does this differ from children who are not overly sensitive?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Less sensitive children show the opposite pattern, engaging outward networks more strongly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1763761642830"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How could these findings improve treatment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Individual brain patterns may help clinicians tailor sensory therapies to each child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Editorial Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list has-background"&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article was edited by a Neuroscience News editor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journal paper reviewed in full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional context added by our staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#73391600005d311601071b1c1f1733061000155d161706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jess Berthold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucsf.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCSF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Jess Berthold – UCSF&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://jneurodevdisorders.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s11689-025-09656-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A neural substrate for sensory over-responsivity defined by exogenous and endogenous brain systems&lt;/a&gt;” by Elysa Marco et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neurodevelopmental Disorders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A neural substrate for sensory over-responsivity defined by exogenous and endogenous brain systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exogenous (outward-directed) and endogenous (inward-directed) neural systems are essential for cognition and behavior. However, how they are altered in neurodiverse (ND) children remains unanswered in part due to heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensory over-responsivity (SOR), the most prevalent form of sensory processing disorder (SPD), serves as a quintessential paradigm for investigating the interaction between exogenous and endogenous brain networks given that both basic and higher-order sensory processing are substantially implicated in this condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurodiverse children ages 8–12 years old (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 83; 30 females and 53 males) were directly assessed for SOR using a structured clinical evaluation, the Sensory Processing 3 Dimensions Assessment (SP3D:A), and underwent 3 Tesla MRI. 39 ND children presented with SOR (ND/SOR) and 44 ND children presented without SOR (ND/NO-SOR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exogenous and endogenous functional connectivity networks (FCNs) were generated through independent component analysis and investigated with two local functional connectivity (FC) measures, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo), as well as a long-range FC measure, dual regression (DR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we examined FC in the context of behavioral regulation as assessed through the Behavioral Assessment System for Children, 3rd edition (BASC-3), categorizing children as “resilient” or “dysregulated” through latent profile analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, ND/SOR children exhibit reduced long-range exogenous FC. However, in terms of local FC, we find that ND/SOR children have reduced exogenous and elevated endogenous FC which is diametrically opposed to ND/NO-SOR children. Furthermore, this double dissociation is specific to ND children who are behaviorally resilient, while emotionally dysregulated ND children possess a distinct pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Achieving optimal brain system connectivity—a balanced contrast—is influenced by sensory over-responsivity and essential for resilience.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 21:53:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE03eFdzdnBleUVISXpFMXpZRlJfOUdHa1JaY3JMN3N0R3Q1VlA2SVVHQVVOUkFQVEJaWEZ0QWQtUkF0c3FObmg3T1h1UUFLVGt1MHdYbHQtTkpHbllBLWZwV2RONGVjZ1oxeDNSbw</guid></item><item><title>怀俄明州马匹暴露于致命的马病毒爆发-牛仔州立日报</title><link>https://cowboystatedaily.com/2025/11/21/wyoming-horses-have-been-exposed-to-outbreak-of-deadly-equine-virus/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="_1sy4yg80 _1t01cac0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Horse owners across the nation have been spooked by the confirmation of a serious — and potentially lethal — equine virus in four U.S. states, with more confirmed cases expected within the next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;There are no confirmed cases in Wyoming yet, but horses in the Cowboy State have been exposed within the last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) and EHV-4 start as respiratory illnesses but can progress to a serious and fatal neurological condition, equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;The mortality rate of EHM can be as high as 75%, and horses that survive require months of intense care and rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;The initial outbreak began at the World Championship Barrel Racing Finals in Waco, Texas, on Nov. 5–9, where between 800 and 1,000 horses from across the nation were assembled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Several cases of two EHV variants and EHM have been confirmed in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma in the last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"As of Friday, there are two confirmed cases in Texas, two in Oklahoma, three in Louisiana, and there might be another case on the East Coast in Maryland," said Russell Nemetz, owner of the Western Ag Network. "We don't want to say the sky is falling, so to speak, but the whole industry is jumping on this ASAP." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Joe Stricklin, a veterinarian in Greeley, Colorado, told Cowboy State Daily that "a confirmed case (of EHM) showing early neurological signs" has been confirmed in Colorado. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;That horse was exposed to the virus in Waco and later attended events in Casper and Wheatland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;That means many Wyoming horses have, in all likelihood, already been exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'Stay Home'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"We're just at the tip of finding out how far and wide this virus has spread," Stricklin said. "It takes anywhere from four to 14 days for horses to start showing symptoms, so we're in that period where (infected horses) are just starting to show symptoms." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Nemetz said he's "not any way, shape, form or fashion an expert in veterinary medicine," but he urges Western horse owners to take an abundance of caution and monitor their horses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"Let's stay vigilant," he said. "We want to create awareness that these viruses are out there, and if you see any signs and symptoms in your horse, it might be worth a call to your veterinarian."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Stricklin has a simple but urgent message to horse owners nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"Stay home," he said. "I'm not going to tell anyone to quit living, but this isn't a common, everyday rhinovirus. It's a variant that has some deadly potential to it." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1uhbe1z3 _1uhbe1z2 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;figure class="n1n9p21"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="p8ohjc5 p8ohjc0 n1n9p22 _10mr6051 vbxqml4 _10mr60539"&gt;Horses can appear perfectly healthy yet spread EHV-1. (USDA)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spread, Symptoms, And Severity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Stricklin, EHV-1 and its variants are notoriously easy to spread. It doesn't take much for the virus to be transmitted from horse to horse. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"The most common method of transmission is going to be horse to horse, nose to nose," he said. "But it can also spread if one horse is shedding, if they're tied beside each other, rode in the same trailer, or drank out of the same bucket." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Humans can also spread EHV-1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;The virus isn't zoonotic, so it can't infect humans, but humans can unknowingly carry and spread it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"If a horse sheds the virus onto someone's clothes, and that person goes to another horse, the virus can be transmitted to that horse," he said. "It's just like a cough or cold. Viral moisture particles can spread the virus from one horse to the next." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Initial symptoms of EHV-1 include nasal discharge and a fever above 101.5 degrees. Symptoms that EHV-1 has progressed into EHM include weakness and stumbling in the hind limbs, difficulty urinating or defecating, "dead tail," and dribbling urine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"It progresses to the point where horses can get down and can't get up," Stricklin said. "In some cases where this variant has surfaced, horses have died within 24 hours of showing the neurological symptoms." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Stricklin described the current outbreak as "moderately serious," but he expects an increase in cases in several states over the next 10 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;He is already monitoring five horses in Colorado that "are either running high temps or starting with discharge from noses" after confirmed exposure to the infected horse from Waco. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"The next 10 days are going to give us a huge outlook into what we can expect for the next month," he said. "If people can take it easy for the next week, we'll know if it's blowing up exponentially or we're getting it under control." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wyoming Exposed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wyo Blu Equine Vet Clinic in Wheatland reports that horses that attended barrel races at Riata Ranch in Cheyenne on Nov. 15 and J Bar C in Wheatland on Nov. 16 were exposed to at least one of the confirmed cases of EHV-1. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Horses of concern also attended a rodeo in Casper around the same time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Stricklin confirmed that Colorado's first confirmed case of EHM attended events in Casper and Wheatland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;It was infected at the World Championship Barrel Racing Finals in Waco, but attended the Wyoming events before showing symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"That horse started showing neurological symptoms on Thursday night," he said. "They were mild at that time, but I haven't spoken to the people treating that horse since then." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Horses exposed in Casper, Cheyenne, and Wheatland might not be showing any symptoms yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Concerned horse owners should begin looking for the initial symptoms, nasal discharge and fever, taking their horse's temperature twice a day, and contacting their local veterinarian immediately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What To Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nemetz said EHV-1 isn't necessarily fatal, provided it's caught and treated as soon as possible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Most of these horses recover, if they receive veterinary care promptly and EHV-1 doesn't progress into EHM," he said. "It does require some strict monitoring and isolation, but as long as you can keep it EHV-1 from progressing, a lot of these horses recover and live." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cvm.missouri.edu/understanding-the-recent-equine-herpesvirus-ehv-outbreak/" title="https://cvm.missouri.edu/understanding-the-recent-equine-herpesvirus-ehv-outbreak/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;The College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Missouri&lt;/a&gt; recommends that any horse that attended the Waco event or any venue with known EHV-1/EHM cases should enter strict quarantine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Trailers and equipment should be disinfected, and horses shouldn't be released from quarantine until 14 days after their last known exposure and a negative test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is a vaccine for EHV-1, but exposed or infected horses shouldn't be vaccinated. Non-exposed horses should receive an EHV-1 booster if they have not been vaccinated within three months. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"It's not a death sentence if it's detected and treated early enough," Nemetz said. "The trick is not to let it go, or think that it's going to get better on its own. Pick up the phone, text your veterinarian, and get them out to check on that animal right away." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stricklin said the last major outbreak of EHV-1 happened in Ogden, Utah, in 2011. It spread to at least eight states and killed several horses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"It's something that people need to take seriously," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Home &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;EHV-1 outbreaks are serious, especially at large events like the World Championship Barrel Racing Finals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;The key to avoiding exposures and getting the outbreak under control is to avoid or use extreme discretion when attending rodeos, horse sales, and other events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;The Billings Livestock Commission already canceled its Nov. 22 livestock sale "due to concerns" about the spread of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Stricklin encouraged horse owners to consider avoiding these events until the extent of the outbreak is better understood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"A lot of times, these horses that have been traveling a lot," he said. "After going hard all summer or all year, their immune systems get weak, so it doesn't take a lot for these horses to become infected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Another reason to stay home is the Marshall and Sterling Insurance/USHJA National Championships, held in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Nov. 10-16. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Horses that were exposed to EHV-1 in Waco might have gone directly to Las Vegas, making it a potential super-spreading event for EHV-1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"I have a great concern for the events that went on in Vegas," Stricklin said. "All the horses at these events have gone in so many different directions, and we're just seeing the first round of the horses getting sick from Waco. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"In another week, we're going to start seeing horses from who knows where starting to show symptoms." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Nemetz encouraged Wyoming horse owners to exercise caution, even if it means missing a rodeo or horse show in the next few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many upcoming events may be cancelled out of caution, but it's not worth risking your horses' health or the spread of EHV-1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"If more positive cases surface, everyone will take a step back," he said. "I'm sure these events and sales will pick back up once we know where we stand, but this is the right time to make sure the virus doesn't continue to spread."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andrew Rossi can be reached at &lt;a href="mailto:arossi@cowboystatedaily.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;arossi@cowboystatedaily.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Cowboy State Daily</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 21:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPeVpSZENaUG15S29NMDRCMUt4QXF3cWNFUE5SWHdQdUZPbVBpdWR6ei01a2UxLW02aGlEelRWcDJmWEoxT3I3bVpQOHlxZnNZaG1OdFY5VVY0b2NhZjNXemIxb3lrLWF3LW55cGtpN2I2N205cTBiVXN1Z0hXV2RrMzdaYTFsSDJPczM3Nmh2YkxDaDNXeEY1UUprRzN1T0d4b0ZpajJMcmZtUFdR</guid></item><item><title>福克斯新闻健康通讯：普通香料可以促进幸福和性健康-福克斯新闻</title><link>https://www.foxnews.com/health/fox-news-health-newsletter-common-spice-could-boost-happiness-sexual-health</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt; &lt;div id="beyondwords-wrapper" class="beyondwords-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="info"&gt;&lt;span class="label-bg"&gt;NEW&lt;/span&gt;You can now listen to Fox News articles!

This has led scientists to wonder: could regular orange juice consumption be a simple strategy to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitians-reveal-best-drink-for-metabolic-health-11832066" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;support heart and metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To explore this idea, researchers looked into the molecular changes that happen in our bodies when we drink orange juice every day. The results offer a fascinating glimpse into how this simple drink can have a powerful &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/a-healthy-lifestyle-may-offset-genetic-risk-factors-8642546" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;impact on our genes and overall well-being&lt;/a&gt;, and the results were published in &lt;em&gt;Molecular Nutrition and Food Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To understand the impact &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7928514/is-orange-juice-healthy/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;100% orange juice&lt;/a&gt; may have on certain aspects of human health, researchers selected 20 healthy adults (10 men and 10 women) between the ages of 21 and 36 for a detailed analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The participants had no chronic diseases and were not smokers, pregnant, or taking medications or supplements that could interfere with the findings. Before the study began, participants underwent a three-day "wash-out" period where they avoided citrus fruits and their derivatives, as well as other flavonoid-rich foods like strawberries, coffee, chocolate and tea. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; During the 60-day intervention, each participant consumed 500 mL (about 17 ounces, or a little over two cups) of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-oranges-11680294" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pasteurized 100% orange juice daily&lt;/a&gt;, split into two servings (half in the morning and half later in the day.) Blood samples were collected at the start (Day 0) and end (Day 60) of the study, along with measurements of blood pressure and other body metrics. To ensure compliance and address any issues, researchers maintained regular contact with the participants, checking in twice a week throughout the study.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The core of the study involved a transcriptomic analysis, which is a sophisticated way of looking at how our genes are expressed, or "turned on" and "turned off." By comparing the gene expression in the participants' blood cells from Day 0 to Day 60, the scientists could see exactly what changed after two months of daily orange juice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After 60 days of drinking 500 mL of 100% orange juice daily, the participants' bodies showed changes at the genetic level.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The analysis revealed that a total of 3,790 gene expressions were altered after drinking 100% orange juice after the study period. Of these, 2,487 genes were downregulated (meaning their activity was turned down), and 1,303 were upregulated (their activity was turned up).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These weren't random changes. The affected genes were directly involved in crucial bodily functions:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood Pressure Regulation&lt;/strong&gt;: Genes linked to high blood pressure were significantly dialed down. This could explain why orange juice has been shown to help lower blood pressure, especially in people with elevated levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; is a major driver of diseases like heart disease, diabetes and obesity. The study found that orange juice was linked to a reduced activity of key inflammatory genes, suggesting it may help calm potentially harmful inflammation in the body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lipid (Fat) Metabolism&lt;/strong&gt;: Orange juice influenced genes involved in how the body processes and stores fat. This could mean it plays a role in improving fat metabolism and even body composition over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body Weight Differences&lt;/strong&gt;: The effects of orange juice varied by body type. In overweight individuals, it had a stronger impact on fat metabolism, while in normal-weight participants, the focus was more on reducing inflammation. This evidence indicates that orange juice’s benefits may adapt to individual needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In essence, daily orange juice consumption appeared to orchestrate a complex series of genetic adjustments that pointed toward &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lifes-essential-8-heart-healthy-actions-to-slow-aging-8391391" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;better cardiovascular and metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While this study is small, other data based on a larger study population that evaluated orange juice’s impact on health factors showed positive results too. A larger systematic review and meta-analysis published in &lt;em&gt;Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; showed results of an analysis of ten clinical trials. It found that drinking at least 500 mL of orange juice daily led to improvements in blood sugar, cholesterol, and inflammation markers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Study Limitations &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the findings from this study are promising, there are a few important limitations to keep in mind. The research included a relatively small group of just 20 healthy volunteers, which may not capture the full range of individual responses, especially in people with existing health conditions or from different age groups and backgrounds. The study lasted only 60 days, so it's unclear whether these molecular changes and health benefits would persist or evolve over a longer period. Finally, since the research focused on a specific population in Brazil, more studies in larger and more diverse groups are needed to confirm these results and better understand how orange juice might benefit people worldwide.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Incorporating orange juice into your daily routine could be a simple yet impactful way to support your health. Beyond being a refreshing drink, orange juice is a source of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-flavonol-rich-foods-11783068" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;flavonoids like hesperidin&lt;/a&gt;, which have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This means that a daily glass of OJ might be linked to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2061448/top-10-anti-inflammatory-foods-for-high-blood-pressure/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower blood pressure, reduced inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and even an improvement on how your body processes fat, all of which are key to reducing the risk of conditions like heart disease, diabetes and obesity. However, for those managing blood sugar levels, it’s important to be mindful of portion sizes, as orange juice contains natural sugars that can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291176/what-happens-when-you-consume-too-much-sugar/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;impact glucose levels if consumed in excess&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What’s even more exciting is how orange juice can work differently depending on your body type. If you’re classified as overweight, it may be linked to helping your body break down fat more effectively, while leaner individuals might experience &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-top-nutrients-to-fight-inflammation-8675325" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stronger anti-inflammatory benefits&lt;/a&gt;. This personalized effect highlights how &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7889078/nutrition-recommendations-need-to-be-more-culturally-relevant-heres-why-it-matters/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;nutrition isn’t one-size-fits-all&lt;/a&gt;; your unique body composition plays a role in how you respond.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This research published in &lt;em&gt;Molecular Nutrition and Food Research&lt;/em&gt; reinforces the idea that orange juice can be a valuable part of a healthy diet. Regular consumption appears to trigger a cascade of beneficial changes at the genetic level, helping to regulate blood pressure, reduce inflammation and influence fat metabolism. While more research is needed, this study adds to the growing evidence that orange juice has plenty of worthwhile benefits.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yinging Ma, lead study author and doctoral student at The Child Health Research Center at Penn State, said: 'By just two months of age, we can already see patterns in feeding, sleep and play that may shape a child's growth trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This shows how important it is to screen early in infancy so we can support families to build healthy routines, prevent excessive weight gain and help every child get off to the best possible start.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published earlier this year in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2837959"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 143 mothers and their babies who were receiving care from Geiser Health System in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pennsylvania/index.html" id="mol-557abf40-c6ea-11f0-9690-cb2f8ffbf0b4"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; and were enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which provides food assistance for women and children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mothers completed a 15-question survey about their infant's diet, sleep, playtime and appetite, as well as if caregivers fed their babies with breastmilk, formula or a combination of the two. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age of the mothers was 26, and 70 percent were white. The majority (58 percent) of households made under $25,000 per year, which is below the poverty line for a three-person household in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At two months old, 73 percent of infants were exclusively formula-fed. Infant growth was measured once at two months and again at six months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found that out of 12 behavioral routines, nine that were done when infants were two months old were associated with higher BMI and weight-to-length ratios when the babies turned six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of feeding, these routines included using bottle sizes that were too big for the infant's developmental stage, feeding too often at night and mothers thinking their infants were hungry more often than they actually were. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Under the sleeping category, the four routines that led to higher weight were going to bed after 8pm, waking up more than twice at night, being put to bed while already asleep instead of drowsy and sleeping in a room with a TV playing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Southern states are more at risk of high death rates from heart disease, the latest data from the CDC shows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for playtime, babies with higher BMIs were more likely to have parents who used their phone or watched TV during playtime and those who had limited active play or tummy time, when an infant spends time on their stomach to strengthen their upper body muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overfeeding infants, along with sedentary habits and a lack of physical activity, causes them to pack on weight. Poor sleep has been shown to increase levels of the hormone ghrelin, which stimulates appetite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it's unclear if the infants in the study remained overweight later in life, research shows early infancy is a key window that determines obesity risk. The first six months of an infant's life determine metabolism, or how well the body is able to turn food into energy. Slower metabolism burns fewer calories, causing them to be stored as excess fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This slow metabolism early in life can cause infants to have bigger appetites as they grow up and more fat mass, leading to obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Affecting three in four Americans, overweight or obesity are primary risk factors for developing chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team hopes to expand their research and look at families with a wider range of socioeconomic backgrounds, as the new study largely focused on low-income households.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jennifer Savage Williams, senior study author and professor and director of The Child Health Research Center at Penn State, said: 'With the limited time available during pediatric and nutrition visits, it's essential to help providers focus on what matters most for each family.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Brain imaging revealed that heavy screen use is associated with smaller cortical volume and disrupted development in regions critical for attention, cognition, and reward processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These structural differences partly explain why children with more screen exposure show worsening ADHD symptoms over time. The findings provide developmental neuroscience evidence that excessive daily screen time may contribute to delayed brain maturation patterns often observed in ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developmental Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; More screen time at ages 9–10 predicted higher ADHD symptoms two years later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Structure Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Screen exposure was linked to smaller cortical volume and altered growth in frontal and temporal regions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mediation Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Cortical volume partially mediated the relationship between screen time and ADHD symptom severity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Fukui&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The digital age has fundamentally reshaped childhood, making screens an integral part of learning, socialization, and entertainment. Globally, screen time among adolescents has surged, accelerated by the isolation and remote learning periods during the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although digital screens are essential tools, their excessive use has been linked to problems such as disrupted sleep, reduced physical activity, and behavioral symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-114023"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/adhd-screen-neurodevelopment.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/adhd-screen-neurodevelopment-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/adhd-screen-neurodevelopment-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/adhd-screen-neurodevelopment-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/adhd-screen-neurodevelopment-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/adhd-screen-neurodevelopment-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/adhd-screen-neurodevelopment-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/adhd-screen-neurodevelopment.jpg" alt="This shows a child, a brain, and screens." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/adhd-screen-neurodevelopment.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/adhd-screen-neurodevelopment-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/adhd-screen-neurodevelopment-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/adhd-screen-neurodevelopment-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/adhd-screen-neurodevelopment-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/adhd-screen-neurodevelopment-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/adhd-screen-neurodevelopment-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The results provided clear evidence of a developmental link: longer daily screen time at baseline was a significant predictor of increased ADHD symptoms after 2 years, even after controlling for initial symptom severity levels. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have pointed out a correlation between higher screen time and more severe attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms—a condition marked by difficulties with attention, hyperactivity, and impulse control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, existing evidence supporting the above correlation was obtained mainly through cross-sectional studies, which can only offer a single ‘snapshot in time’ across the researched population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, our understanding of whether and how screen time influences the development of ADHD, as well as its underlying neural mechanisms affecting brain development, remains limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aiming to bridge this gap, a research team led by Assistant Professor Qiulu Shou, Assistant Professor Masatoshi Yamashita, and Associate Professor Yoshifumi Mizuno, all affiliated to the University of Fukui, Japan, conducted a large-scale study on the impact of screen time on brain development and ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their study was published in Volume 15 of the journal &lt;em&gt;Translational Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; on October 31, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used data from the large-scale Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study in the United States, tracking 11,878 children initially aged 9 to 10 years over a 2-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study is the first to examine the relationship between screen time, ADHD symptoms, and brain structure from a developmental perspective using such a large-scale database,” explains Dr. Shou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on advanced magnetic resonance imaging data and parent-reported behavior assessments, the team carefully analyzed the direct associations between screen time and ADHD symptom severity, its development over 2 years, and the resulting changes in brain structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results provided clear evidence of a developmental link: longer daily screen time at baseline was a significant predictor of increased ADHD symptoms after 2 years, even after controlling for initial symptom severity levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, screen time was also associated with developmental abnormalities in multiple key brain structures. At baseline, it was linked to a smaller total volume of the cortex and reduced volume in a region known as the right putamen, which plays a key role in language learning, addiction, and reward-related processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 2 years, screen time was associated with hindered development of cortical thickness in regions vital for cognitive functions, including the right temporal pole and specific areas of the left frontal gyrus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the findings of this study centered on the role of brain structure as a mediator of ADHD symptoms. Statistical analyses suggest that total cortical volume partially mediates the relationship between screen time and ADHD symptoms at baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In essence, this means that the observed association between longer screen time and greater ADHD symptom severity is, at least in part, explained by the observed smaller cortical volume. The team suggests that excessive screen exposure may contribute to a delayed brain maturation pattern that is often observed in children with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By providing evidence of a neural mechanism, this study bolsters our understanding of the link between digital habits and behavior in developing children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work provided some evidence toward growing concern about the association between digital media exposure and children’s mental and cognitive health,” comments Dr. Yamashita. “The results provide some neuroscientific evidences for the need to control screen time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this study adds to the existing literature that strongly suggests reducing screen exposure among school-aged children is pivotal to their development. Dr. Mizuno concludes, “Our findings provide evidence that longer screen time is associated with increased ADHD symptoms and brain structural development. The findings of our research enhance our understanding of the link between screen time and ADHD symptoms, as well as the neural mechanisms underlying ADHD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conclude, this study paves the way for further investigation that may guide both the technology industry and the educational sector toward designing digital environments that support, rather than hinder, children’s cognitive growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project was funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science through Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) (Grant numbers: 24K16647, 21K02380), Kawano Masanori Memorial Public Interest Incorporated Foundation for Promotion of Pediatrics (AY 2022), Research Grants from the University of Fukui (AY 2023), and the Life Science Innovation Center, University of Fukui (AY 2023).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1763744762754"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Does screen time actually &lt;em&gt;predict&lt;/em&gt; later ADHD symptoms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Yes.

When vitamin B12 levels drop too low, the skin is usually one of the first areas to show noticeable changes. These signs can include pigmentation issues, dryness, inflammation, or paleness, all of which reflect how the body struggles to deliver oxygen and nutrients to skin cells. Recognising these early symptoms is crucial, as untreated deficiency can lead to more serious neurological and blood-related complications. Identifying the signs promptly allows for effective treatment and better long-term skin and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Vitamin B12 is important for skin health&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B12 plays a vital role in maintaining healthy skin by supporting proper cell formation, growth, and repair. Without adequate levels, the skin may not receive sufficient oxygen and essential nutrients, leading to visible changes such as dryness, pigmentation irregularities, or slower healing of wounds. Beyond its direct effect on skin cells, B12 deficiency can weaken the immune system, making the skin more susceptible to infections and inflammatory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also affects nerve function, which can contribute indirectly to dermatological issues like sensitivity or tingling sensations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Vitamin B12 rich foods for vegetarian diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Common skin-related signs of Vitamin B12 deficiency&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2294086/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a study published in Canad­ian Family Physician&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, vitamin B12 deficiency can manifest on the skin long before more widely recognised signs appear. The authors describe cases where the only visible symptoms were persistent, non-itchy hyperpigmented patches or polymorphic skin lesions. In one individual, dark patches on the toes improved within two weeks of B12 treatment. In another case, rash-like lesions on the neck and limbs resolved entirely after supplementation. These findings highlight that unexplained and non-resolving skin changes can be an early and overlooked indicator of deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;1. Hyperpigmentation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A noticeable darkening of the skin, especially on the hands, feet, and knuckles, is one of the most common dermatological signs of vitamin B12 deficiency. The skin may appear patchy, uneven, or darker than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2.

These may resemble vitiligo and often appear on exposed areas, gradually becoming more noticeable and sometimes spreading if the underlying trigger persists over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3. Pale or jaundiced skin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low vitamin B12 can lead to reduced red blood cell production, resulting in pale skin. In some cases, the breakdown of abnormal red cells may cause a yellowish tint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4.

Dry skin and hair changes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;B12 deficiency may cause excessive dryness, flaking, or rough texture of the skin.

When levels drop, fewer healthy red cells are produced, reducing oxygen flow to the skin. This can lead to cell damage, pigmentation changes, and impaired skin healing. Neurological effects and weakened immunity may further worsen skin issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who is at higher risk of Vitamin B12 deficiency &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may be more likely to develop a Vitamin B12 deficiency if you are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vegetarian or vegan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over the age of 50&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Living with digestive disorders such as gastritis or Crohn’s disease&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taking antacids or metformin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experiencing poor nutrient absorption&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>布兰登·白金汉（ Brandon Buckingham ）表示，他的“心脏，肝脏和肺功能衰竭”在健康更新方面- Dexerto</title><link>https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/brandon-buckingham-says-his-heart-liver-and-lungs-are-failing-in-concerning-health-update-3285918/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-1"&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Epilepsy isn’t something we usually associate with specific geographic regions, but new research suggests that’s an oversight—at least in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New research finds that certain parts of the U.S. have much higher rates of epilepsy than others. Researchers examined the Medicare data of Americans over 65 from across the country. Older adults were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with a new case of epilepsy if they lived in the southeastern U.S., they found. The findings suggest that this region might have unique risk factors that contribute to the neurological condition, such as hotter weather or larger health care disparities, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Modifiable social and environmental conditions at the local level may contribute to epilepsy incidence among older adults and could help guide targeted prevention efforts,” the authors wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2841156"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in JAMA Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The epilepsy belt&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/epilepsy-and-seizures"&gt;disorder&lt;/a&gt; characterized by surges of unusual electrical activity in the brain, which then causes recurring seizures. There are many different causes and forms of epilepsy, but it’s known that certain groups of people are more likely to develop it, including older adults.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While previous research has shown that the prevalence of diagnosed epilepsy can differ between various regions of the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00302-5/fulltext"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214035"&gt;the U.S&lt;/a&gt;., the scientists behind the new study say theirs is the first to map how often epilepsy affects older Americans at a national level.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers are from the Houston Methodist Research Institute in Texas and Case Western Reserve University in Ohio. They analyzed Medicare claims data from 2016 to 2019, focusing on epilepsy cases newly diagnosed in 2019. All told, there were about 20,000 cases diagnosed that year. And the incidence rate of epilepsy varied significantly between regions of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The highest rates were found in southeastern states like Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. The researchers also identified various factors that seemed to be correlated with epilepsy in the states along this “epilepsy belt”—as the researchers have dubbed it. Rates of insufficient sleep were higher in Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia, for instance; southern states also had more days of extreme heat during the year (a heat index above 95 degrees); and states like Texas and Florida had higher uninsurance rates (younger people without insurance are less likely to see a doctor, which could then delay a timely diagnosis).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While some of these factors are thought to clearly increase epilepsy risk, like poor sleep, others have received less attention as potential causes.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This is the first study documenting such a strong association between extreme heat and incident epilepsy in older adults across the U.S., highlighting the importance of climate change in emergency preparedness, especially given the graying of the population,” said study researcher Siran Koroukian, professor in the Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, in a &lt;a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/newsroom/discovering-america-s-epilepsy-belt-first-of-its-kind-national-study-reveals-us-regions-with-high/"&gt;statement.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Notably, this same region of the U.S. is also known to have higher rates of stroke, which has led researchers to call it the “&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.119.024155"&gt;stroke belt&lt;/a&gt;“. Since strokes are yet another major risk factor of epilepsy, that too is likely playing a part in causing new cases.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Areas of improvement&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s estimated that about 3 million American adults are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/data-research/facts-stats/index.html"&gt;living with epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;. And while the condition isn’t currently curable in most cases, it can be effectively treated with medications, surgery, and managing potential triggers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers hope their findings can help improve efforts on epilepsy prevention and mitigation through various public health interventions in the areas of the country where people’s risk is highest.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“These may include improving sleep health, enhancing heat resilience, and reducing transportation and insurance-related barriers to care,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;(Des Moines) -- State health officials have confirmed the first flu death this fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Iowa Health and Human Services announced Friday an older individual from southwest Iowa is the first influenza-related death of 2025-26 respiratory season. Iowa's most recent Respiratory Virus Surveillance Report shows the virus at a very low level of activity, and hospitals are currently reporting low patient admission rates. Although flu activity in Iowa is currently low, officials say Iowans can take precautions to keep themselves and their families healthy throughout the respiratory virus season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three studies published in one of the most respected medical journals paint a vivid picture of how ultra-processed foods are wreaking havoc on global health. Their packaging is bright, their claims are bold, but strip away the marketing, and what remains is not exactly food. It’s more like an industrial formulation that mimics food.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the US, ultra-processed foods (UPFs) &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/ultraprocessed-foods-account-for-more-than-half-of-calories-consumed-at-home"&gt;account for over half of adult calories&lt;/a&gt;, and over 60% of children’s calories. Many other countries &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8398521/"&gt;have comparable figures&lt;/a&gt;, so UPFs are on the rise almost everywhere. And according to the world’s largest scientific review on the subject, these products are now linked to harm in every major organ system of the human body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-just-burgers-and-sodas"&gt;Not Just Burgers and Sodas&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s no simple, straightforward definition of ultra-processed foods, even though they’re so widespread. They’re foods that usually have a lot of ingredients and are prepared through methods that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6389637/"&gt;we couldn’t do ourselves at home&lt;/a&gt;. They’re often very rich in salt and sugar, as well as plenty of additives. They also typically have unnatural textures and are ready to eat or just need heating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists use something called the “Nova” system to classify UPFs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the Nova group 1 you have basic things like apples, uncooked rice, or fish. These are &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/most-ultra-processed-food-is-bad-but-there-are-some-big-exceptions/"&gt;unprocessed or minimally processed&lt;/a&gt;. On the other end, you have Nova group 4: &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/8-everyday-foods-you-might-not-realise-are-ultra-processed-and-how-to-spot-them/"&gt;Ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;. These are the sodas, the packaged snacks, the reconstituted meat nuggets, and the breakfast cereals that never go stale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30744710/"&gt;Carlos Monteiro&lt;/a&gt;, Brazilian epidemiologist who coined the term ultra-processed food and introduced the Nova classification, argues in the new study that UPFs have &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/eating-more-ultra-processed-foods-tied-to-increased-risk-of-early-onset-colorectal-cancer/"&gt;fundamentally different chemical structures&lt;/a&gt; than “regular” food. He and his colleagues focus on something called the food matrix.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you eat something like a fruit or a whole almond, your body has to work to break down the cell walls to access the fats and nutrients. This is the “food matrix.” It slows digestion and sends satiety signals to your brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;UPFs destroy that matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The manufacturing process breaks down raw ingredients into molecular slurry, then reconstructs them using emulsifiers, texturizers, and artificial flavors. The result is something referred to as “hyper-palatable.” It melts in your mouth so fast your brain never gets the signal to stop eating. That’s a big reason why UPFs are so bad for you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The consequences are visible in the data: over 100 prospective studies link these foods to adverse outcomes in nearly all organ systems, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="upfs-took-over-the-world"&gt;UPFs Took Over the World&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How did we reach a point where 50% of the average diet consists of these industrial products?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to blame consumers. These foods are tastier, more palatable (by definition), and oftentimes, cheaper. Oftentimes, we know they’re &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/ultra-processed-foods-made-healthy-young-men-gain-fat-and-lose-sperm-quality-in-just-three-weeks/"&gt;not as healthy&lt;/a&gt; and we still buy them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/13/the-guardian-view-on-ultra-processed-food-blame-business-not-consumers"&gt;deeply unfair&lt;/a&gt; to put consumers at the center of the problem. It wasn’t an accident. It was a business model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The third paper in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; series drops a bombshell, comparing the &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/tobacco-company-smuggling-03092018/"&gt;food industry’s tactics&lt;/a&gt; directly to the &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/nutrition-medicine/tobacco-companies-were-big-in-promoting-junk-food-in-america/"&gt;tobacco industry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;UPFs are significantly more profitable than fresh food. They have a long shelf life and use cheap ingredients like soy protein isolate and high-fructose corn syrup. To protect these profits, the industry has deployed a “corporate political activity” playbook.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rough idea is that they lobby governments to block any regulation that would push for healthier food (and people) at the expense of their product. They fund research to manufacture doubt about the science. They infiltrate health agencies. The authors note that the industry has created a “global network of front groups” to ensure that policy debates focus on individual choice rather than corporate culpability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-how-do-we-reclaim-our-plates"&gt;So, How Do We Reclaim Our Plates?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second paper in the series outlines a policy roadmap, and the message is clear: we need to treat UPF like the public health crisis it is. Otherwise, obesity will continue to worsen, along with all the other problems associated with unhealthy diets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’re in the same position with food that we were with cigarettes in the 1960s. The evidence is mounting, but the regulation is lagging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors call for aggressive moves. We need to ban the marketing of UPFs to children. We need to remove these products from schools and hospitals. And we need clear warning labels — not just about calories, but about the level of processing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If that sounds really hard, well, it is. But it’s not impossible. Look at Brazil, for instance. Their national school food program has eliminated most UPFs. By 2026, they will require 90% of the food served in schools to be fresh or minimally processed. They proved that government policy can prioritize health over corporate profit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While we wait for policy to catch up, you have to be your own defense system. Some simple things you can do:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignore the front of the package.&lt;/strong&gt; The health claims are marketing.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at the ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;. If you see ingredients you wouldn’t find in a home kitchen — emulsifiers, protein isolates, high-fructose corn syrup — it’s likely ultra-processed.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the matrix.&lt;/strong&gt; Eat foods that look like they grew out of the ground, not foods that were born in a factory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Current treatments cannot cure the condition. Although antibody-based drugs targeting amyloid β (Aβ) have recently become available, their benefits remain modest. These therapies can also be expensive and may trigger immune-related side effects, underscoring the need for safer, low-cost options that are easier for patients to access.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;Neurochemistry International&lt;/em&gt; reports that researchers from Kindai University and partner institutions found that oral arginine, a naturally occurring amino acid that acts as a safe chemical chaperone, can markedly reduce Aβ aggregation and its toxic effects in animal models of AD. The team noted that although arginine is sold as a dietary supplement, the dose and schedule used in their experiments were designed for research and do not match commercial products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was led by Graduate Student Kanako Fujii and Professor Yoshitaka Nagai from the Department of Neurology, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka, along with Associate Professor Toshihide Takeuchi from the Life Science Research Institute, Kindai University, Osaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laboratory and Animal Tests Show Strong Anti-Amyloid Activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments demonstrated that arginine slows the formation of Aβ42 aggregates in a concentration-dependent fashion. Building on this evidence, the researchers tested oral arginine in two widely used AD models:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; model, expressing Aβ42 with the Arctic mutation (E22G)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;An &lt;em&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-G-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;knock-in mouse model, carrying three familial AD mutations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both systems, arginine treatment led to a significant drop in Aβ buildup and reduced the harmful effects associated with Aβ exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study demonstrates that arginine can suppress Aβ aggregation both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;," explains Prof. Nagai. "What makes this finding exciting is that arginine is already known to be clinically safe and inexpensive, making it a highly promising candidate for repositioning as a therapeutic option for AD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits Extend Beyond Amyloid Reduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mouse model, oral arginine lowered amyloid plaque formation and reduced insoluble Aβ42 levels in the brain. Mice receiving arginine also performed better in behavioral assessments and showed decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes linked to neuroinflammation, a key contributor to AD progression. These results indicate that arginine's benefits may involve not only preventing aggregation but also providing broader neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings open up new possibilities for developing arginine-based strategies for neurodegenerative diseases caused by protein misfolding and aggregation," notes Prof. Nagai. "Given its excellent safety profile and low cost, arginine could be rapidly translated to clinical trials for Alzheimer's and potentially other related disorders."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repurposing Existing Compounds for Alzheimer's Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research highlights the advantages of drug repositioning, a strategy that repurposes existing safe compounds for new therapeutic uses. Because arginine is already approved for clinical use in Japan and shows good brain permeability, it may bypass multiple early hurdles that often slow traditional drug development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers stress that additional preclinical and clinical studies are essential to confirm whether these effects will translate to humans and to determine appropriate dosing strategies. Even so, the results present strong proof of concept that basic nutritional or pharmacological supplementation could reduce amyloid pathology and improve neurological health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Cost-Effective Approach With Global Potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study deepens scientific understanding of how Aβ aggregation occurs and presents a practical approach that could be implemented at scale. Its findings point to a cost-effective, readily available strategy that may one day support people affected by AD across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common health problems of old age -- dehydration, delirium, malnutrition or falls -- can become catastrophic if they occur following a major surgery, a new study reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seniors who suffer these issues while recovering from surgery are more likely to die within a year, and will require more time in hospitals or nursing facilities, researchers reported Thursday in the &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/journalacs/abstract/9900/new_onset_geriatric_syndromes_among_patients.1441.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of the American College of Surgeons&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A geriatric syndrome can be a 'canary in the coal mine,' signaling a patient's underlying vulnerability," senior researcher &lt;a href="https://cancer.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/search-physician-directory/timothy-m-pawlik" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Timothy Pawlik&lt;/a&gt;, a surgical oncologist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's crucial we don't dismiss these events as just a normal part of 'getting older.' These are important warning signs that a patient needs closer monitoring and tailored support, both in the hospital and after discharge," Pawlik said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed Medicare claims data for more than 780,000 patients older than 66 who underwent one of five major operations between 2016 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operations included coronary artery bypass, lung removal, repair of an artery aneurysm in the abdomen, removal of the pancreas or removal of part of the colon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 11% of patients developed at least one new geriatric syndrome during their hospitalization -- delirium, dehydration, malnutrition, falls or loss of bladder or bowel control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dehydration was the most common problem, affecting 67% of patients, followed by delirium (25%) and malnutrition (13%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who developed one of these health problems of old age were far less likely to be discharged directly home. They spent a median of 16 fewer days at home in the three months following surgery -- 27% less than those who didn't develop a geriatric syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seniors who developed any one of the problems also had a doubled risk of death within one year. That death risk more than tripled if a person developed two or more geriatric syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who were older and had other existing health problems were more likely to develop a post-surgical geriatric syndrome, researchers found. The risk also was higher if they needed emergency surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, minimally invasive procedures were associated with a 49% lower risk of developing a geriatric syndrome, results show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings show that it's important to approach surgery for older people differently, researchers said, by taking into account their medical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By focusing on the unique needs of older patients, we can better anticipate, prevent, and manage these syndromes, which directly translates to helping patients get back home and back to their lives," Pawlik said.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chopping and lightly stir-frying your broccoli may increase the amount of a specific antioxidant, called sulforaphane, thereby maximizing the health benefits you get from the vegetable, research suggests.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The paper, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry&lt;/em&gt;, raises the question of whether there are “right” and “wrong” ways to cook broccoli.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study found that cooking inhibits another enzyme called myrosinase, which is essential for sulforaphane production. Therefore, longer, harsher cooking methods result in a greater reduction in sulforaphane levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It is widely known that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/raw-vs-cooked-vegetables-11812062" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prolonged cooking can degrade nutrients&lt;/a&gt; in broccoli, including sulforaphane,” &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephani-johnson-rdn-dcn-88856120/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Stephani Johnson, RDN, DCN&lt;/a&gt;, adjunct professor in the department of clinical and preventive nutrition services at the Rutgers School of Health Professions, told Verywell.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study found that lightly stir-frying broccoli actually helped decrease the activity of myrosinase during the cooking process, which translates to higher levels of sulforaphane on your plate.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, researchers found that chopping broccoli into florets about 90 minutes before lightly stir-frying it was associated with the highest levels of sulforaphane.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This is likely because chopping activates myrosinase, facilitating the conversion of glucoraphanin to sulforaphane before the enzyme is deactivated by heat,” Johnson said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study is limited in that the authors didn’t look at how other forms of preparation—such as microwaving or steaming—affect the sulforaphane levels in broccoli.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Despite this limitation, the findings suggest that preparation techniques, such as pre-cutting and light cooking, play a significant role in maximizing the health benefits of broccoli,” Johnson said.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sulforaphane is a naturally occurring compound found in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/green-vegetables-7975333" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cruciferous vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, including broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and kale, and it’s been linked to multiple health benefits, Johnson said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “One of its key functions is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/oxidative-stress-8351176" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stimulating the production of antioxidant enzymes&lt;/a&gt; in the body, which &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/information-about-free-radicals-2249103" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;neutralize free radicals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-with-more-antioxidants-than-pomegranate-seeds-11835037" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;protect cells from oxidative damage&lt;/a&gt;,” she explained.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Antioxidants, such as sulforaphane, play a role in cancer prevention by supporting the removal of cancerous substances from the body, inhibiting the growth of cancer cells, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/anti-inflammatory-foods-2505929" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reducing inflammation and oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt;, she added.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Broccoli is also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/high-fiber-vegetables-11704101" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high in fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which supports digestive health, and it is packed with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/broccoli-sprouts-11842634" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;powerful antioxidants like sulforaphane&lt;/a&gt;, lutein, and zeaxanthin,” she added.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But while some preparation styles come with extra perks, &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/walmart-broccoli-recall-listeria-8767927" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;broccoli&lt;/a&gt;, in any form, is good for you. “Regardless of how it’s prepared, broccoli remains a low-calorie food rich in fiber, making it a valuable addition to a healthy diet,” Johnson said.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though the study might inspire you to change up your &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/healthiest-vegetables-8415670" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vegetable&lt;/a&gt; routine from time to time, you shouldn’t stop eating broccoli the way you like it, even if it doesn’t provide the highest possible amount of sulforaphane, experts said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If raw broccoli sounds good to you, that’s a perfectly good reason to eat it, Johnson said. “Ultimately, eating broccoli in any form is better than not eating it at all, but raw or lightly cooked preparations are generally the best options for maximizing its health-promoting properties.”

While mitigation measures such as hunting may help slow its spread, it can't be stopped. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because cervids are ubiquitous and free ranging, the interval from infection to symptom onset can take years, and prions spread easily from animal to animal and through environmental contamination, which can persist for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnston's daughter, Kristal Enter, 39, a fundraiser in Boston, is familiar with CWD and its potential implications for human health. "Seeing what my mom went through, I do not want anyone else to have to experience that, nor their family members," she told CIDRAP News. "The more we're on top of chronic wasting disease and thinking about it, the better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the frightening thing is that, for well over a month during the recent US government shutdown, no one was watching the human disease landscape for CWD, a highly infectious disease with no treatment or cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;If cases slip by, it will be too late&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nine days after the government shutdown began, all four staff members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases Prion and Public Health Office were sent home after receiving reduction-in-force (RIF) notices. While the end of the shutdown led all four to be reinstated through at least January, layoffs after that time are possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Within the past few months, two other researchers who had been part of the team also had to be let go after their fellowship contracts weren't renewed, per the administration's policy of blocking contract renewals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The prion unit, which monitors the nation for human prion diseases, is part of the Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology. It launched in the mid-1990s in response to the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or "mad cow disease") in UK cattle. BSE prions were inadvertently consumed by people who ate contaminated beef, causing the human form of BSE, variant CJD (vCJD). All infected people—more than 230—died. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The initial goal of the Prion and Public Health Office was to watch for any cases of vCJD in the US population. Since then, its focus has expanded to include advising hospitals on how to prevent and respond to prion contamination of instruments used in neurosurgery (prions are resistant to many usual sterilization methods), as well as working with state health departments on disease surveillance. Unit members also answer questions from the public.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, as CWD continues its inexorable march across the landscape, exposing more and more people, the prion unit's priority is conducting surveillance for signs of a CWD species jump into high-risk people such as hunters. Without this expertise, no one will be able to evaluate whether a suspected case of CWD prion transmission to humans is likely from an animal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The prion unit has launched several epidemiologic studies in collaboration with multiple states to look at whether more hunters are dying of prion diseases than would be expected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-right"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As an example of the unit's work, last spring, a cluster of CJD cases in Oregon was widely conjectured to be linked to CWD. Such cases require autopsy and an epidemiologic investigation to determine whether CWD was involved and, if so, what kind of public health measures are needed. The prion unit shared ideas and strategy with the Oregon state health department in this investigation, which, thankfully, found no link.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But experts say that without anyone looking for these deviations from normal—particularly given that signs of illness may take years to appear—cases could easily go unnoticed, and it will be too late to implement public health measures that could mitigate some of these consequences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lawrence Schonberger, MD, MPH, retired chief of the Prion and Public Health Office, said that, as was the situation with BSE, CWD containment efforts must continue. "Unlike with mad cow disease, however, these efforts to date have not been successful," he said. Surveillance and research "should continue to help people recognize any emerging risk to humans from this agent now and in the future, when this agent's pathogenicity [ability to cause disease] may change."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Worst time to get rid of such a division'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brian Appleby, MD, is director of the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center at Case Western University, which conducts diagnostic testing for human prion diseases and conducted Johnston's autopsy. The CDC funds the center, which collaborates with the Prion and Public Health Office on public health efforts and research projects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;To vape or not to vape?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That is the question sparking a heated debate this week in Geneva where over 1,400 delegates have gathered to discuss the World Health Organization's Tobacco Control Treaty and what they call "the tobacco epidemic."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For years, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/12/16/788597890/new-study-offers-first-evidence-of-vapings-long-term-risks" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stories&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; warning about the dangers of vapes, also known as e-cigarettes, and other non-cigarette products like heated tobacco and nicotine pouches.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many scientists and public health experts point out that the tobacco industry promotes and profits from these newer products and that many young non-smokers are using e-cigarettes and becoming addicted to nicotine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;However, a number of doctors, scientists and public health experts argue that, while these products are dangerous, they may not be as dangerous as traditional cigarettes, which &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tobacco" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;kill up to half&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of long-term users. As the lesser of two evils, their argument goes, e-cigarettes could be useful in helping people quit smoking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This matters because even though smoking rates have been dropping, 1.2 billion people worldwide continue to use tobacco. About 80% of them live in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Accusations of industry influence and scientific censorship are flying.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;WHO staked out its stance on the issue this month in a strongly worded &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/who-position-on-tobacco-control-and-harm-reduction" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;position paper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; slamming the idea of using e-cigarettes as a tool in smoking cessation. And at the anti-tobacco gathering in Geneva, leaders are calling for tough new restrictions on products like vapes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both sides agree that getting this question right now is key to addressing the tobacco epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Mea culpa!"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago, Dr. Derek Yach was well regarded in the public health world.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The South African physician played a leading role in drafting and launching WHO's landmark tobacco treaty. And the treaty has played a critical role in reducing tobacco use, which has dropped by a third largely due to strategies like health warnings, taxation and bans on advertising.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But now? Yach acknowledges he's a pariah to many former colleagues. "I'm excommunicated," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's because of his stance on e-cigarettes, heated tobacco and the like.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yach has come to believe that the traditional approach to smoking cessation is insufficient. "There was only one message allowed and still is today: The only way to get rid of smoking is to get everybody to quit," he says, arguing that this approach doesn't "recognize the toughness that people go through with a complex addiction, which is driven by nicotine."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In many other areas of medicine, the idea of "harm reduction" is well established. For example, public health programs provide sterile needles to drug users so they don't spread HIV and hepatitis. It reduces the harm, even if it doesn't solve the addiction. Yach sees e-cigarettes as a method of harm reduction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While products like e-cigarettes still have nicotine, it is not burned. Instead, a heating element converts a nicotine liquid into a vapor that is inhaled.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's in the process of burning that you create the cancer-causing agents and many of the other toxins that eventually cause the death and disease," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yach wants to see these products promoted by doctors and health programs as a way to help current smokers cut back on smoking or quit altogether. He remembers thinking to himself: "Mea culpa! I've missed what is probably the greatest opportunity to save lives."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yach eventually founded the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World, to advocate for this approach. It's since been renamed Global Action to End Smoking and is under new leadership.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's an important point to note about this group. It's funded by the tobacco industry. That connection has cemented his self-described excommunication.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Yach is not a lone voice. &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/quit-smoking/using-e-cigarettes-to-stop-smoking/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The U.K&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.'s National Health Service, for example, has embraced e-cigarettes as a way to help people stop smoking. And a number of academics — independent of the tobacco industry — have come to agree with him. Mike Cummings, a professor and researcher at the Medical University of South Carolina, is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Cummings does not want non-smokers to use e-cigarettes or the other products — but he also stresses that "for somebody who is already addicted to nicotine in cigarettes, having an alternative that would be safer, like an e-cigarette, is something that's worth considering."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because of his call for a debate, Cummings says, he's been shunned by many in the world of tobacco control. He says the fact that he's testified against tobacco companies in court more than 200 times hasn't saved him from being on the outs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"One of the ways they have attacked us is to claim that we're shills for the cigarette companies, which is absurd. We're not," Cummings says. "Many of us are legitimate scientists."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says an open debate hasn't happened yet — and that it can be hard to get funding for research into smoking harm reduction strategies. "That's not science. That's anti-science. It's censorship," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the largest tobacco companies, Phillip Morris International, declined an interview request from NPR but said in a statement that WHO shouldn't fear dialogue and is out of step with governments that are embracing smoke-free products in order to end smoking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Mass marketing harmful products"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to the idea of harm reduction, WHO is adamant in its opposition. Its &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/who-position-on-tobacco-control-and-harm-reduction" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;position paper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says the tobacco industry is "misappropriating" the medical term harm reduction and "mass marketing harmful products" while "cloaking" it in medical language.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Let's be clear, the companies that make these products are not motivated by harm reduction or health, they are motivated by one thing and one thing only: generating profit," says WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. "There is no evidence of their net benefit for public health, but mounting evidence of their harm."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One major concern in this debate is that the products are often used by non-smokers — especially young ones who are attracted by the flavors and packaging.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We see use rates [of e-cigarettes] among children nine times higher than among adults," says Benn McGrady. He heads Public Health Law and Policies at WHO, which helps governments develop and defend tobacco laws. "The latest data that we have shows there are 15 million children worldwide using e-cigarettes."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;McGrady worries that, without proper regulations, there could be a generation of people newly addicted to nicotine. WHO argues that countries need to regulate the products at least as strictly as cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Last month, the International Pediatric Association also came out forcefully against e-cigarettes, warning in the medical journal &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/156/5/e2025072337/204538/E-Cigarettes-and-the-Nicotine-Epidemic-Statement?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;/a&gt;"e-cigarette use is associated with cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, oral diseases and cancer, with dual users facing greater health risks than cigarette smokers alone." The stakes, their position paper says, are high: "E-cigarettes threaten to reverse decades of progress in tobacco control."&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's the opposite of harm reduction, right? That's really harm-causing," says &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/stella.bialous" target="_blank"&gt;Stella Bialous&lt;/a&gt;, the associate director for Global Tobacco Control Initiatives at the University of California, San Francisco's Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One concern that's surfaced has been &lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2025/07/16/disposable-e-cigarettes-study" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;exposure to metals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — like lead — in the heating element of the e-cigarette. However, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41254430/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have pointed in both &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38411454/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;directions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to exactly how risky these new products are, McGrady says, there's huge variation between the various products and it's "not responsible" to generalize. These products are relatively new and WHO's report acknowledges their risks will only become clear over time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"An unutterable scam"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For some, this debate feels like déjà vu — and a classic example of the tobacco industry interfering in public health efforts and sowing division.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bialous says many researchers believe that this debate is "actually one of the strategies that a tobacco company developed to divide and conquer — like 'let's talk about harm reduction and get all the people fighting among themselves while we continue to sell the products.'"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Tim McAfee is the former head of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Office on Smoking and Health — which has now been eliminated by President Trump. He says this current battle reminds him of when the industry promoted filtered cigarettes as safer in the 1950s and when they pushed low-tar cigarettes in the '60s and '70s.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Every single one of those things they've done over the last 100 years has turned out to be an unutterable scam," he says. He calls the effort to promote e-cigarettes and similar products a smokescreen.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cummings, the professor at Medical University of South Carolina, counters that just because these newer products are backed by the tobacco industry doesn't automatically mean they can't play a role in smoking reduction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We ought to get the evidence and weigh it and debate it — and help guide the policies based on evidence, not on ideology," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NPR</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 15:05:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOejVvTGhKYVdYcVNxS0Y3QWJZM0M1VnJDYU5DNkMzZDBRN19CVGdRMmpNRjRPVDYzRzkxbEdKUTh0YVduOXlCemNTQzd5MHVUVHRjM25kSEdMdWQxUWFGellBUTFOSDR3ZEd6VjYxRnpvX0VaYUVOSFI4V1JuLVVqTWFfRzM0U2Z0N09xSFV4Y1dPRVBaVmZscHh3OWVwNFJTLXhhT1BNZw</guid></item><item><title>科学家刚刚将耳鸣与您每天在不知不觉中使用的主要身体功能联系起来-印度国防评论</title><link>https://indiandefencereview.com/scientists-just-linked-tinnitus-to-a-major-body-function-you-use-daily-without-realizing-it/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The persistent hum, hiss, or ring of &lt;strong&gt;tinnitus&lt;/strong&gt;—often described as a phantom sound—is not just a sensory glitch. For more than &lt;strong&gt;250 million people globally&lt;/strong&gt;, it’s an unrelenting companion that reshapes daily life. From mild irritation to full-blown sleep disruption and anxiety, the condition is often treated as untouchable: poorly understood, difficult to diagnose, and impossible to cure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that assumption is beginning to shift. New research from the &lt;strong&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/strong&gt; has unearthed a surprising connection between tinnitus and one of the body’s most fundamental systems: &lt;strong&gt;sleep&lt;/strong&gt;. Specifically, the patterns of neural activity that drive deep sleep may also act as a natural suppressor of tinnitus-related brain signals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the center of this research is a radical reframe of tinnitus—not as a static condition of the ear, but as a &lt;strong&gt;dynamic brain state&lt;/strong&gt; that shifts depending on the body’s internal rhythms. That premise could open the door to a new class of therapies rooted not in external interventions, but in the body’s own architecture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Sleep, the Brain’s Quiet Regulator&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt;, focus on &lt;strong&gt;non-REM (NREM) sleep&lt;/strong&gt;, the phase characterized by &lt;strong&gt;slow-wave brain activity&lt;/strong&gt; critical for cognitive recovery. These deep-sleep rhythms appear to directly counteract the &lt;strong&gt;hyperactive neuronal firing&lt;/strong&gt; linked to tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a 2022 &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcac089" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; and a follow-up &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tinnitus-is-somehow-linked-to-a-crucial-bodily-function" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;animal study&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;em&gt;Linus Milinski&lt;/em&gt; of Oxford’s Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute, researchers observed &lt;strong&gt;ferrets&lt;/strong&gt; after exposure to loud noise. Those that developed tinnitus also showed &lt;strong&gt;disrupted sleep patterns&lt;/strong&gt; and signs of &lt;strong&gt;overactive brain responses&lt;/strong&gt; to sound stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We could actually see these sleep problems appear at the same time as tinnitus after noise exposure,” Milinski said. “This suggested, for the first time, a clear link between developing tinnitus and disrupted sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During episodes of &lt;strong&gt;deep NREM sleep&lt;/strong&gt;, the abnormal hyperactivity in the auditory cortex was significantly dampened. When the animals remained awake or slept lightly, the tinnitus-related signals persisted—indicating that &lt;strong&gt;sleep may suppress or modulate tinnitus activity&lt;/strong&gt; in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another study from South China University of Technology, cited by Milinski in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tinnitus-is-somehow-linked-to-a-crucial-bodily-function" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ScienceAlert&lt;/a&gt;, found similar patterns in human participants. Researchers noted that individuals with tinnitus were &lt;strong&gt;less able to suppress brain hyperactivity&lt;/strong&gt; as they transitioned into sleep. During deep sleep, however, the abnormal activity was markedly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Neurological Loop With No off Switch&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications of these findings go far beyond the lab. Clinical evidence supports a pattern that tinnitus and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/he-vanished-into-a-cave-for-63-days-and-came-out-with-a-groundbreaking-discovery-that-redefined-science/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="78236" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; frequently &lt;strong&gt;co-occur&lt;/strong&gt;—and may &lt;strong&gt;reinforce each other&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 2023 study published in the &lt;em&gt;International Archives of Otorhinolaryngology&lt;/em&gt; examined patients with chronic tinnitus and found that over &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1735455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;72% rated their sleep quality as poor&lt;/a&gt;. More than a quarter experienced &lt;strong&gt;moderate insomnia&lt;/strong&gt;, and a significant correlation was found between &lt;strong&gt;tinnitus severity&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;sleep disruption&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another independent study in &lt;em&gt;Medicine (Baltimore)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000040303" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; similar findings: patients with more severe tinnitus experienced &lt;strong&gt;greater insomnia symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;, although no strong link was found to daytime sleepiness or risk of sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/topographic-overlap-of-brain-areas-involved-in-tinnitus-and-nrem-sleep.jpeg" alt="Topographic Overlap Of Brain Areas Involved In Tinnitus And Nrem Sleep" class="wp-image-96181" srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/topographic-overlap-of-brain-areas-involved-in-tinnitus-and-nrem-sleep.jpeg 520w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/topographic-overlap-of-brain-areas-involved-in-tinnitus-and-nrem-sleep-380x159.jpeg 380w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topographic overlap of brain areas involved in tinnitus and NREM sleep&lt;em&gt;. Credit: Milinski et al., Brain Comms., 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;According to Milinski, “Tinnitus can make sleep worse, and poor sleep may, in turn, make tinnitus worse. It may be a kind of vicious circle, although I do not believe it is unbreakable.” This quote is taken directly from &lt;a href="https://rnid.org.uk/hearing-research/silencing-tinnitus/how-does-sleep-affect-tinnitus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RNID’s research page&lt;/a&gt;, where Milinski outlines the research goals and early findings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea that &lt;strong&gt;tinnitus may represent “local wakefulness” during sleep&lt;/strong&gt;—a state where certain brain regions remain active while others are shut down—has also been proposed in a &lt;a href="https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/news/a-role-of-sleep-in-tinnitus-identified-for-the-first-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from Oxford’s Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics. This mismatched brain state may prevent restorative deep sleep and allow tinnitus-related activity to persist, even as most of the brain rests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Reframing Tinnitus as a Brain Rhythm Disorder&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, tinnitus has been viewed through a peripheral lens—as a consequence of &lt;strong&gt;ear damage&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;age-related hearing loss&lt;/strong&gt;. But the research now points to a more central problem: &lt;strong&gt;cortical hyperactivity&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly in the &lt;strong&gt;auditory cortex&lt;/strong&gt;, driven by abnormal neural feedback loops.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;iframe title="What does tinnitus sound like? Ringing, crackling, buzzing examples" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kgIrfiyK4x8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This aligns with a broader theory in neuroscience that &lt;strong&gt;phantom percepts&lt;/strong&gt; like tinnitus stem from &lt;strong&gt;dysregulated spontaneous activity&lt;/strong&gt; in the brain. In this framework, tinnitus is not just a reaction to silence but a &lt;strong&gt;maladaptive brain prediction&lt;/strong&gt;, continually generating sound in the absence of real stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Oxford-led review in &lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt; introduces a new model: by amplifying or supporting &lt;strong&gt;deep sleep&lt;/strong&gt;, it may be possible to &lt;strong&gt;interrupt this pathological loop&lt;/strong&gt; and rebalance the brain’s auditory pathways. The researchers propose that enhancing &lt;strong&gt;slow-wave activity&lt;/strong&gt;, either naturally or through non-invasive neurostimulation, could become a &lt;strong&gt;therapeutic pathway&lt;/strong&gt; for future treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Timing and Intervention&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If confirmed through large-scale studies, these insights could change how tinnitus is treated—and when. Milinski and his team believe that &lt;strong&gt;early intervention&lt;/strong&gt;—in the hours or days after tinnitus onset—could prevent it from becoming chronic, particularly if sleep is supported during this period.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Widening the scope in tinnitus research towards the brain’s natural dynamics will provide fruitful ground for understanding those of pathological nature,” Milinski said in &lt;a href="https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/news/a-role-of-sleep-in-tinnitus-identified-for-the-first-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oxford’s official research statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future research will aim to identify &lt;strong&gt;neurophysiological markers&lt;/strong&gt; of tinnitus during sleep and test methods to reinforce deep-sleep brain activity. The goal is not just to mask tinnitus, but to &lt;strong&gt;interrupt the brain’s faulty feedback loop&lt;/strong&gt; at its source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For me, swimming is all about freedom and weightlessness,” says Ella Foote, editor of &lt;em&gt;Outdoor Swimming Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, the world’s only print publication dedicated entirely to open-water swimming.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Foote is passionate about swimming outdoors, especially in the United Kingdom’s chilly waters.“Winter can feel dull and lifeless here,” she admits. “But since I’ve started swimming outside year-round, I see it differently. It’s become a way to connect with nature, even in the cold.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Throughout the cold months, Ella makes a point to swim at least once a week. That consistency, she notes, makes all the difference. “It’s like going to the gym; if you go often, you start to love it. But if you only do it occasionally, you just end up wondering why anyone would.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But what &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;happens to your body when you plunge into freezing water? Why does something so unpleasant turn into such a satisfying high afterward? Turns out, there’s some real science behind that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-science-of-the-cold-plunge"&gt;The Science of the Cold Plunge&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you first jump into cold water, whether it’s a plunge, a shower, or a swim, your body experiences what’s called the &lt;em&gt;cold shock response&lt;/em&gt;,” explains &lt;a href="https://brocku.ca/applied-health-sciences/kinesiology/faculty-research/faculty-directory/stephen-sau-shing-cheung-ph-d/"&gt;Dr. Stephen Sau-Shing Cheung&lt;/a&gt;, from Brock University.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This happens when your skin temperature suddenly drops from warm to cold. It triggers your fight-or-flight response, preparing your body for action,” he told &lt;em&gt;ZME Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cheung notes that the sympathetic nervous system activates aggressively, flooding your body with adrenaline. It is the same kind of intense physiological arousal you would experience if you were suddenly startled or injured.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k.jpg"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k-750x500.jpg 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k-1140x760.jpg 1140w,https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k.webp 2047w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" type="image/webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k-1024x683.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k-750x500.jpg 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k.jpg 2047w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" class="wp-image-294051 sp-no-webp" alt="" decoding="async"&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Image credits: David Bledsoe.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, this response is more than just an adrenaline rush; it can be a critical, even life-threatening event, particularly for people with underlying heart conditions. From a medical perspective, your body quickly shifts to a faster heart rate, higher blood pressure, and shortness of breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This creates a physiological paradox known as “autonomic conflict.” The cold shock triggers a signal to accelerate the heart (tachycardia), while the ‘diving response’ sends a powerful ‘brake’ signal to slow the heart down. This conflict places the heart in an unstable state and can cause severe cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats). In rare cases, it can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3459038/"&gt;cause sudden cardiac death&lt;/a&gt;, even in young, fit, and healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, in many cases, and especially for swimmers like Ella, that physiological jolt comes with mental and emotional benefits. “If I swim on a winter morning, I’m more productive, I sleep better, and I’m generally in a better mood,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s even more encouraging, she adds, is that you don’t have to spend long in freezing water to feel the effects. “Just a couple of minutes, two to five, really, is enough to get most of the benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Cheung insists there isn’t any solid scientific evidence to support many of the purported long-term physiological health benefits. Furthermore, the cold plunge is very risky for the uninitiated and unhabituated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you have a known heart condition or poor circulation, it’s important to be cautious,” Dr. Cheung warns. “At the very least, check with your doctor first and get a physical before trying it, because it does put stress on the heart, especially if you already have an underlying issue.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="your-body-on-cold-water"&gt;Your Body on Cold Water&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boxing_Day_Swimming_-_geograph.org_.uk_-_1093200.jpg"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boxing_Day_Swimming_-_geograph.org_.uk_-_1093200.webp " type="image/webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boxing_Day_Swimming_-_geograph.org_.uk_-_1093200.jpg" class="wp-image-294052 sp-no-webp" alt="" decoding="async"&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Image via Wiki Commons.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, if there are risks, why do people like Ella report feeling so good? The answer lies in &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Hormesis"&gt;a process known as hormesis&lt;/a&gt;, where a low-dose, acute stressor induces beneficial, adaptive responses that enhance resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For starters, repeated, controlled exposures (&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9467574/"&gt;as few as&lt;/a&gt; six 3-minute immersions) can help the body mitigate these dangerous reflexes. This is called habituation. The physiological effects are profound and many of the health hazards are minimized (though not eliminated).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But what about the physiological benefits?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It turns out, many of the claims are based on &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9518606/"&gt;relatively small-scale studies&lt;/a&gt;, and the scientific evidence is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0317615"&gt;observational studies&lt;/a&gt; note that regular swimmers report fewer infections, but this is plagued by a “healthy user bias”—it’s unclear if the swimming makes people healthy, or if only healthy people choose to do it. Cold exposure is a well-known activator of the Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT), a special “burning” tissue that generates heat by consuming glucose and lipids. Repeated exposure can turn “storage” fat into “burning” fat, but contrary to popular belief, this doesn’t always lead to fat loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most robustly supported long-term benefit is the one Ella describes: a profound effect on mood. The science provides a clear neurochemical basis for this. One study &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10751106/"&gt;examining the hormonal response&lt;/a&gt; to one hour of cold water immersion (at 14°C or 57°F) found a massive 530% increase in plasma noradrenaline (norepinephrine).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This massive surge probably explains why people feel so good after cold swimming. Noradrenaline is a key neurotransmitter for arousal, vigilance, and focus, producing the feeling of being “wide awake” and cognitively sharp. &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/feature-post/health/mind-brain/why-dopamine-makes-you-happy/"&gt;Dopamine&lt;/a&gt; is the primary neurotransmitter of the brain’s reward and motivation circuits, providing a powerful feeling of pleasure, satisfaction, and elevated mood that explains the practice’s “antidepressant effect”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="winter-swimming-tips"&gt; Winter Swimming Tips&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Henri_kuprashvili_-_The_Winter_Swimming_2014.jpg"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Henri_kuprashvili_-_The_Winter_Swimming_2014.webp 960w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Henri_kuprashvili_-_The_Winter_Swimming_2014-750x500.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" type="image/webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Henri_kuprashvili_-_The_Winter_Swimming_2014.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Henri_kuprashvili_-_The_Winter_Swimming_2014.jpg 960w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Henri_kuprashvili_-_The_Winter_Swimming_2014-750x500.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" class="wp-image-294053 sp-no-webp" alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async"&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The Winter Swimming World Championships in 2014. However, outdoor swimming is much more popular as an amateur activity. Image via Wiki Commons.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, there’s also the subjective experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Outdoor swimming often feels spontaneous, something you do on a sunny day,” says Ella. “Winter swimming is different. You need to plan ahead: get in, enjoy it, and get out safely.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She emphasizes the importance of knowing your own body. “Go regularly and pay attention to how you feel. Take notes if it helps, learn what works for you. Don’t stay in too long, because of something called ‘afterdrop.’ That’s when your body keeps cooling even after you’re out. We call the first few minutes after a swim the ‘honeymoon period.’ You feel amazing and alive, but it’s actually the crucial time to get dry, put on warm clothes, and sip a hot drink before chatting with others.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cheung recommends never going alone. This is more than just a safety thing; it makes the entire activity more enjoyable. “Cold bathing in a social environment gives you connection, and it gets you out of the house on a chilly day. Those are some of the added benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also issues a strong warning about alcohol: “Don’t mix alcohol with cold swimming. It dulls your sensations, so you don’t respond as well if an emergency arises, the kind of signals your body gives in cold water. Alcohol also keeps your blood vessels and skin wide open, which makes you feel warm and flushed, but it actually causes you to lose heat faster.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lastly, it’s always recommended to have a quick way to dry and reheat. Hot drinks are always welcome after a cold swim.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those prepared and respectful of the risks, a cold plunge can be more than a shock. It’s an invigorating reset—one that wakes up the body, sharpens the mind, and leaves many swimmers riding a natural high for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than a third of Americans who were vaccinated against COVID-19 say they had side effects from the shot, and nearly half suspect the vaccines killed many patients,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that 68% of American Adults say they got a COVID-19 vaccination, and a majority (60%) of vaccinated adults report no side effects from the vaccine. However, 26% say they had minor side effects and 10% reported major side effects from the vaccine. Based on a U.S. adult population of 258 million, this would mean 63 million had at least some side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine, including more than 17 million who experienced major side effects.

&lt;/div&gt;            &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among all American Adults (including those who didn’t get vaccinated against COVID-19), 46% believe it is likely that side effects of COVID-19 vaccines have caused a significant number of unexplained deaths – down from 55% in &lt;a href="/public_content/lifestyle/covid_19/killer_shot_most_still_suspect_covid_19_vaccine_risk" target="_self"&gt;September 2024 &lt;/a&gt;– including 25% who say it’s Very Likely. Forty-four percent (44%) now don’t think a significant number of deaths have been caused by vaccine side effects, including 20% who believe it’s Not At All Likely. Another 12% are not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey of 1,292 American Adults was conducted on November 10-12, 2024 by Rasmussen Reports. The margin of sampling error is +/- 3 percentage points with a 95% level of confidence. Field work for all Rasmussen Reports surveys is conducted by Pulse Opinion Research, LLC. See&lt;a href="https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/about_us/methodology" target="_blank"&gt; methodology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who didn’t get the COVID-19 vaccine are more likely to suspect it had deadly side effects. Seventy percent (70%) of those who weren’t vaccinated, compared to 36% of those who did get the shot, consider it at least somewhat likely that side effects of COVID-19 vaccines have caused a significant number of unexplained deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those who were vaccinated, 85% of those who reported major side effects think it’s at least somewhat likely that COVID-19 vaccines caused a significant number of deaths. By comparison, 69% of those who reported no side effects from the vaccine consider it unlikely that COVID-19 vaccines caused a significant number of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slightly more men (72%) than women (66%) got vaccinated against COVID-19 during the pandemic, and more men (12%) than women (8%) report experiencing major side effects from the shot. However, more women (49%) than men (43%) consider it at least somewhat likely that side effects of COVID-19 vaccines have caused a significant number of unexplained deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older voters are most likely to have been vaccinated against COVID-19 during the pandemic, and less likely to say they experienced side effects. Twenty-two percent (22%) of men under 40 say they experienced major side effects from the vaccine, compared to just seven percent (7%) of women 40 and older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty-two percent (42%) of whites, 46% of blacks, 53% of Hispanics and 63% of other minorities believe it is at least somewhat likely that side effects of COVID-19 vaccines have caused a significant number of unexplained deaths. Hispanics are most likely to have gotten the COVID-19 vaccine during the pandemic, and also most likely to report having experienced major side effects from the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty-seven percent (57%) of Americans with annual incomes between $30,000-$50,000 say it’s likelythat COVID-19 vaccines caused many deaths, compared to just 36% of those with annual incomes over $200,000 who say the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of living – particularly higher grocery prices – &lt;a href="/public_content/business/general_business/81_of_americans_now_concerned_about_inflation" target="_self"&gt;continues to worry most Americans.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;About one in ten perimenopausal or menopausal women masturbate to relieve their symptoms, according to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/GME.0000000000002675"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; that has generated &lt;a href="https://www.technologynetworks.com/diagnostics/news/women-rate-masturbation-highly-for-managing-menopause-symptoms-407027"&gt;media interest&lt;/a&gt; around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attention is likely because masturbation is a novel (and possibly somewhat salacious) strategy to ease these symptoms, and older women are &lt;a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=_onDEAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PA123&amp;amp;dq=older+women+treated+as+asexual&amp;amp;ots=8G12H9r5JV&amp;amp;sig=Ud_eYMUr6sdfTbe10Z0dsIZclb4"&gt;often seen as asexual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So does masturbating really relieve symptoms, as the study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Menopause&lt;/em&gt; suggests? Let's see if the evidence stacks up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/menopause-isnt-as-responsible-for-lost-libido-as-we-always-thought"&gt;Menopause Isn't as Responsible For Lost Libido as We Always Thought&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The health benefits of masturbation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in the United States and was led by researchers at the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, one of the world's best known research institutes that specializes in sex and relationships. The study was funded by sex toy company Womanizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers surveyed a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4135/9781412963909.n363"&gt;representative sample&lt;/a&gt; of 1,178 perimenopausal and menopausal women aged 40–65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who reported changes in their periods but still had at least one period in the previous year were categorized as perimenopausal. Women who said they had not have a period in a year or longer were categorized as menopausal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About four in five of the women said they had ever masturbated. Of those, about 20 percent said masturbating relieved their symptoms to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For perimenopausal women, the most improved symptoms were sleep difficulties and irritability. For a small number of menopausal women, it helped most with vaginal pain, bloating and painful urination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are consistent with previous research showing masturbating to orgasm may help &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19317611.2024.2344812"&gt;reduce anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and psychological distress, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2019.00033"&gt;improve sleep&lt;/a&gt; and reduce &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14681990601149197"&gt;vaginal pain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, research on the health, social or relationship benefits of masturbation, including for menopause relief, is sparse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, we cannot be sure exactly how masturbating might improve symptoms. But researchers propose the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/sxmrev/qeaf023"&gt;relaxation effects&lt;/a&gt; of orgasm, and the release of endorphins, can improve mood, help sleep and reduce pain. Sexual stimulation may also induce vaginal lubrication and blood flow to the genital area, which can help maintain vaginal function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small number of women in the study said masturbating worsened their symptoms, although it was unclear why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182606" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182606" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ClitoralAnatomyDiagram.jpg" alt="Diagram showing the anatomy of a clitoris ." class="wp-image-182606 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ClitoralAnatomyDiagram.jpg 1284w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ClitoralAnatomyDiagram-642x618.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ClitoralAnatomyDiagram-701x675.jpg 701w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ClitoralAnatomyDiagram-768x739.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ClitoralAnatomyDiagram-600x578.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1284px) 100vw, 1284px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182606" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The internal anatomy of the clitoris, with the clitoral hood and labia minora indicated as lines.

But it still carries a level of stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-010-9722-0"&gt;Women&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, often associate masturbation with sexual shame and tend &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sexol.2017.09.009"&gt;not to talk&lt;/a&gt; openly about their masturbation habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2012.745474"&gt;stigma and invisibility&lt;/a&gt; of masturbation means it is rarely the subject of clinical research investigating its benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, we have very little evidence on its effectiveness to relieve menopause symptoms, especially compared to other non-medical interventions such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-024-03243-4"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/2515690X19829380"&gt;stress relief&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US study showed women were substantially more likely to manage menopause symptoms through &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13697137.2025.2548806"&gt;evidence-based strategies&lt;/a&gt; of physical activity, diet or stress reduction, than with masturbation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, many women in the study might have never considered masturbation to relieve their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Masturbation isn't for everyone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masturbation is free, relatively easy and, for most women, &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-29/its-time-to-close-the-masturbation-gap/10182068"&gt;enjoyable&lt;/a&gt;. There is no reason why it should not be promoted as an accessible menopause relief strategy that may benefit some women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is not always so simple. There may be barriers for some women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-021-02071-z"&gt;Not all women&lt;/a&gt; masturbate or enjoy masturbation. The US study showed nearly one in five women surveyed had never masturbated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This number was higher among older, menopausal women, perhaps reflecting &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1300/J056v14n02_04?urlappend=%3Futm_source%3Dresearchgate.net%26medium%3Darticle"&gt;generational change&lt;/a&gt; in attitudes about masturbation. Some women in the study indicated a moral or religious resistance to masturbation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other studies have similarly shown that a number of women &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-006-9123-6"&gt;do not masturbate&lt;/a&gt;. There may be many reasons for this, from lack of desire through to &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/06/happyplaytime-app-hopes-to-help-women-masturbate-but-overlooks-the-real-reason-that-we-dont-logistics.html"&gt;limited privacy&lt;/a&gt; or "alone time".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.09.037"&gt;Older women&lt;/a&gt; may experience complex physical barriers, including loss of libido or limited dexterity and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silence and stigma around masturbation may also make it difficult for health professionals to discuss masturbation with women. This was evident in the US study, with almost all reporting they had never spoken to a doctor about masturbation for any reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many women were open to these conversations, however, with about 56 percent of perimenopausal women indicating they would masturbate more often to treat menopause symptoms if their doctor recommended it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Masturbation as a novel strategy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there can be no guarantee masturbation will relieve menopause symptoms for all women, suggesting women give it a go is unlikely to cause harm. It is the &lt;a href="https://www.health.qld.gov.au/newsroom/news/give-yourself-a-hand-the-health-benefits-of-masturbation"&gt;safest sex available&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't talk much about masturbation, especially among older women. But by demonstrating that most older women do masturbate and this may offer health benefits, this latest study is novel and valuable.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270146/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

For people in the US, the UK and Australia, these foods make up &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/nov/19/australia-ultra-processed-foods-consumption-rate-upf-lancet" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more than half the calories they consume each day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But it’s not always easy to tell which foods are ultra-processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The term was coined &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19366466/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;in 2009&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at the University of São Paulo, as part of their &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/ultraprocessed-foods-what-they-are-and-how-to-identify-them/E6D744D714B1FF09D5BCA3E74D53A185" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nova food classification system&lt;/a&gt; that sorts foods into four groups:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Group one: unprocessed or minimally processed foods including whole fruits and vegetables, milk, oats and rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Group two: processed basic ingredients used in cooking including salt, sugar and vegetable oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Group three: processed foods made by adding items from groups one and two. Includes canned legumes, bread and cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Group four: ultra-processed foods which are commercial products made from extracts of foods, often with added chemicals, flavours and other ingredients you wouldn’t find in a home kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While there can be health harms from an unbalanced diet of foods in any of the groups – for example, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/24/the-truth-about-salt-how-to-avoid-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-hidden-killers" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;those containing too much salt&lt;/a&gt; – researchers say the problem with group four is that the processes used to make them and the industrial ingredients they contain mean they are not “real food” and are more likely to cause health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But they can be hard to spot. A long ingredients list with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;names you don’t recognise (hello maltodextrin and soy lecithin) is a giveaway for ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you’re unsure, the &lt;a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Open Food Facts&lt;/a&gt; app lets you search for products and see their category.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you decide to take a combination creatine and magnesium supplement, consider taking it in the morning or with your workout.

&lt;p&gt;The discovery could open the door to new treatments targeting age-related ailments by boosting the immune system’s natural ability to fight aging. The immune cells identified, &lt;strong&gt;CD4 T cells &lt;/strong&gt;that produce a protein called Eomes, appear to be a crucial defense against the harmful effects of cellular senescence, which has long been associated with aging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What Are Senescent Cells and Why Are They Harmful?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Senescent cells, often referred to as “zombie cells,” are &lt;strong&gt;cells that have stopped dividing&lt;/strong&gt; but remain active within the body. While they don’t contribute to tissue regeneration, they can secrete harmful molecules that trigger &lt;strong&gt;inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;, causing damage to surrounding tissues. As we age, the accumulation of these cells accelerates, leading to a breakdown of tissue integrity, which can pave the way for chronic diseases like cardiovascular issues, dementia, and even cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recent research has shown that the immune system becomes less efficient at clearing these cells as we get older. This gradual decline in immune function is a key contributor to the frailty and vulnerability to &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/researchers-protein-shield-against-alzheimer/" data-type="post" data-id="88084"&gt;disease &lt;/a&gt;seen in aging populations. Understanding how the immune system adapts to aging, and specifically &lt;strong&gt;how it targets senescent cells&lt;/strong&gt;, is vital for developing potential therapies aimed at delaying or even reversing some aspects of aging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;CD4-Eomes Cells: The Immune System’s New Weapon&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the team’s recent &lt;a href="https://sci-net.xyz/10.1038/s43587-025-00953-8" data-type="link" data-id="https://sci-net.xyz/10.1038/s43587-025-00953-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, the immune system responds to the presence of senescent cells by creating a specialized subset of CD4 T cells, known as &lt;strong&gt;CD4-Eomes&lt;/strong&gt;. These cells are armed with proteins that help clear away damaged tissues and prevent the inflammatory effects caused by senescent cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In experiments with mice of various ages, researchers found that CD4-Eomes cells were significantly &lt;strong&gt;more abundant in older mice&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly in environments rich with senescent cells. When CD4-Eomes cells were genetically removed from mice, the number of senescent cells increased, along with a marked decline in physical health and lifespan. This strongly suggests that CD4-Eomes cells play an essential role in controlling the&lt;strong&gt; buildup of senescent cells&lt;/strong&gt;, which in turn helps mitigate aging-related damage.&lt;/p&gt;

The data reveal age-related declines in T-cell function that are partially restored after senolytic treatment. ©Nature Aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Potential Pathway to Combat Chronic Diseases&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings from the study offer intriguing possibilities for chronic diseases linked to aging. In particular, the researchers found that CD4-Eomes cells could alleviate symptoms in models of &lt;strong&gt;liver cirrhosis&lt;/strong&gt;, a condition marked by chronic inflammation and fibrosis. When CD4-Eomes cells were present, scarring in the liver was reduced, and senescent cell levels dropped. This could have profound implications for conditions like liver disease, arthritis, and other chronic inflammatory disorders that are exacerbated by aging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the idea of boosting CD4-Eomes cells to slow aging is still a long way from practical application, it represents an exciting direction in the quest for interventions that improve healthspan, not just lifespan. As neurophysiologist &lt;a href="https://fohs.bgu.ac.il/monsonegolab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alon Monsonego&lt;/a&gt; from Ben-Gurion University points out, the goal might not be to “reset” the immune system to that of a younger person, but rather to enhance the immune system’s ability to function optimally at each stage of life. More research is needed to understand how these cells work in humans and whether they can be effectively harnessed for therapeutic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This discovery sheds light on a vital immune function that could help combat some of the most challenging aspects of aging. By targeting senescent cells with the help of immune cells like CD4-Eomes, scientists may one day be able to slow aging and reduce the impact of age-related diseases.
