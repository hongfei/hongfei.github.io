			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rolling out a yoga mat and flowing with your breath could be one of the best exercises for improving sleep in the long run.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A meta-analysis of 30 randomized controlled trials has revealed that regular, high-intensity yoga is more strongly associated with improved sleep than walking, resistance training, combination exercise, aerobic exercise, or traditional Chinese exercises, like qi gong and tai chi.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The trials included in the analysis came from more than a dozen countries and involved over 2,500 participants with sleep disturbances across all age groups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-4-simple-exercises-could-help-break-your-insomnia"&gt;&lt;b&gt;These 4 Simple Exercises Could Help Break Your Insomnia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When researchers at the Harbin Sport University in China crunched the numbers, they found that high-intensity yoga for less than 30 minutes, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;twice a week, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;was the best exercise antidote for poor sleep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking was the next best form of physical activity, followed by resistance exercise. &lt;span&gt; Positive results were seen in as few as 8 to 10 weeks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The findings are somewhat inconsistent with a 2023 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.43595"&gt;&lt;span&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which found that aerobic exercise or mid-intensity exercise three times a week is the most effective way to improve sleep quality in individuals with sleep disturbances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; One of the studies included in that trial, however, did find that yoga had more significant effects on sleep outcomes than other exercise types.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What's more, yoga can be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/well/move/does-yoga-qualify-as-an-aerobic-workout.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;difficult to categorize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; as either aerobic or anaerobic, and its intensity can vary depending on the technique used. Perhaps these differences in practice can explain why the outcomes differ from trial to trial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most recent meta-analysis cannot explain why yoga may be particularly beneficial for sleep, but several possibilities exist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not only can yoga raise the heart rate and push the muscles, it can also regulate breathing. Research &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-5225-2788-6.ch005"&gt;&lt;span&gt;indicates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that breath control can activate the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasympathetic_nervous_system"&gt;parasympathetic nervous system&lt;/a&gt;, which is involved in 'rest and digestion'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/hm.hm_78_19"&gt;&lt;span&gt;studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; even suggest yoga regulates brainwave activity patterns, which could &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.33745/ijzi.2023.v09ispl2.006"&gt;&lt;span&gt;promote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; deeper sleep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But while &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-better-sleep-this-one-piece-of-advice-seems-to-work-for-almost-everybody"&gt;&lt;span&gt;robust&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/bad-night-of-sleep-this-20-minute-fix-can-do-wonders"&gt;&lt;span&gt;evidence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; suggests that exercise in general is beneficial for sleep, studies that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-4-simple-exercises-could-help-break-your-insomnia"&gt;&lt;span&gt;compare specific exercises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and their long-term effects are lacking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Caution should be exercised when interpreting findings from studies on sleep disturbances, given the limited number of studies included and the unique characteristics of the sleep disturbances population," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s41105-025-00596-7"&gt;warn&lt;/a&gt; researchers at Harbin Sport University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our bodies and brains are all different, and there's no one-size-fits-all solution to insomnia or other sleep disturbances. Sweating on a yoga mat is just one available option of many.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s41105-025-00596-7"&gt;Sleep and Biological Rhythms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Since mosquitoes can travel several miles, county health officials urge everyone in the region to take precautions and prevent mosquito bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement says symptoms of the St. Louis encephalitis virus are similar to those of the West Nile virus, and most people who contract it will not have symptoms. Those who do have symptoms can experience fever, headache, vomiting and tiredness, and some can develop a neuroinvasive form of the virus that can lead to tremors, disorientation and paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus can — in some rare cases — cause long-term disability or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary Hill, epidemiology bureau manager with the county health department, encouraged providers to consider a St. Louis encephalitis virus diagnosis for patients with matching symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Louis encephalitis virus is not transmitted from person to person outside of blood transfusion, according to health officials; it is spread by mosquitoes that feed on infected birds. There are currently no vaccines or medications for the virus, and the only way to prevent it is to prevent mosquito bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some suggestions from the county health department on how to avoid mosquito bites include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use an EPA-registered repellent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear long sleeves and pants after dusk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drain any standing water in your yard, making sure to also clear debris from the roof gutters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cut weeds and tall grass short, as "adult mosquitoes look for these shady places to rest during the hot daylight hours."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department urges county residents to be cautious until the first frost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services reported that St. Louis encephalitis virus was detected in three mosquito pools —  0.36% of pools tested across the state — while West Nile virus was detected in 64 pools, or 7.55% of pools tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statewide report says there have been three human cases of West Nile virus reported in Utah this year: two in the Bear River health district and one in Salt Lake County. There have also been three cases of West Nile virus in horses, two in Utah County and one in the Bear River health district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

This brain region, which gates sensory information, was found to be overactive during stimuli and social interactions, leading to seizures, repetitive behaviors, and social withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By suppressing this activity with drugs, including one already under investigation for epilepsy, researchers were able to reverse these symptoms. The findings suggest a shared brain mechanism between autism and epilepsy and highlight a promising new target for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Target:&lt;/strong&gt; Hyperactivity in the reticular thalamic nucleus linked to autism behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Success:&lt;/strong&gt; Drugs that suppressed this activity reversed autism-like symptoms in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings explain overlap between autism and epilepsy, with potential for new therapies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Stanford&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanford Medicine scientists investigating the neurological underpinnings of autism spectrum disorder have found that hyperactivity in a specific brain region could drive behaviors commonly associated with the disorder.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a mouse model of the disease, the researchers identified the reticular thalamic nucleus — which serves as a gatekeeper of sensory information between the thalamus and cortex — as a potential target for treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112357"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Recognizing this connection, the researchers tested an experimental seizure drug, Z944, and found that it reversed behavioral deficits in the autism mouse model. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, they were able to reverse symptoms similar to those of autism — including susceptibility to seizures, heightened sensitivity to stimulus, increased motor activity, repetitive behaviors and decreased social interactions — by giving the mice drugs that suppressed this area of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same drugs are being studied for the treatment of epilepsy, highlighting where the processes underlying autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy may overlap in the brain and why they often occur in the same patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings will be published Aug. 20 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;. The senior author of the study is John Huguenard, PhD, professor of neurology and neurological sciences.

In mice that had been genetically modified to model autism (Cntnap2 knockout mice), the reticular thalamic nucleus showed elevated activity when the animals encountered stimuli like light or an air puff as well as during social interactions. The brain region also showed bursts of spontaneous activity, causing seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is much more prevalent in people with autism than in the general population — 30% versus 1% — though the mechanisms are not well understood. Recognizing this connection, the researchers tested an experimental seizure drug, Z944, and found that it reversed behavioral deficits in the autism mouse model.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a different experimental treatment that genetically modifies neurons to respond to designer drugs, known as DREADD-based neuromodulation, the researchers could suppress overactivity in the reticular thalamic nucleus and reverse behavioral deficits in the autism mouse model. They could even induce these behavioral deficits in normal mice by ramping up activity in the reticular thalamic nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings highlight the reticular thalamic nucleus as a novel target for the treatment of autism spectrum disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this autism and neuropharmacology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cdaaa2a1a9a0aca3af8dbeb9aca3aba2bfa9e3a8a9b8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bruce Goldman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://stanford.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Bruce Goldman – Stanford&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adw4682" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Reticular Thalamic Hyperexcitability Drives Autism Spectrum Disorder Behaviors in the Cntnap2 Model of Autism&lt;/a&gt;” by Sung-Soo Jang et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reticular Thalamic Hyperexcitability Drives Autism Spectrum Disorder Behaviors in the Cntnap2 Model of Autism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by social deficits, repetitive behaviors, and comorbidities such as sensory abnormalities, sleep disturbances, and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although thalamocortical circuit dysfunction has been implicated in these symptoms, its precise roles in ASD pathophysiology remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we examine the specific contribution of the reticular thalamic nucleus (RT), a key modulator of thalamocortical activity, to ASD-related behavioral deficits using a &lt;em&gt;Cntnap2&lt;/em&gt; knockout mouse model. &lt;em&gt;Cntnap2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice displayed increased seizure susceptibility, locomotor activity, and repetitive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrophysiological recordings revealed enhanced intrathalamic oscillations and burst firing in RT neurons, accompanied by elevated T-type calcium currents. In vivo fiber photometry confirmed behavior-associated increases in RT population activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, pharmacological and chemogenetic suppression of RT excitability via Z944, a T-type calcium channel blocker, and via C21 activation of the inhibitory DREADD hM4Di significantly improved ASD-related behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings identify RT hyperexcitability as a mechanistic driver of ASD and highlight RT as a potential therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 19:41:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTFBWY3ktQXlhLURQYnhoLTVZWlBrZFFLc1VwRWdPSF9MRUNRQ2lWNmhrT2F1ZzFoQ3VxSTJES3JodS1Lb1EwUnhVc3hHNkZ0X19PR2lkSzhhakduUGE1OE0xQlQzRTFjMnYtRklWZGs1ZXpVWmo0QmNidw</guid></item><item><title>癌症诱导的神经损伤促进对抗PD-1治疗的耐药性-自然</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX0FVX3lxTE1sRlRnUTlHUC1yRk9UYjNUcVk0U19vc3VvRC1XaW83UEVkdjN1bm1SU1hON2czYnB5RjE2VGl4ZXN0OEZQbFJ5Vk84d05ULUhEQWtkNUtHNm5QVENIUlRn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec7-content"&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec8"&gt;Clinical samples and cohorts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09370-8#MOESM11"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; summarizes the different clinical cohorts used in this Article, and presents the results of their relevant analysis.

In brief, the trials were conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All patients provided written informed consent. The authors had unrestricted access to the data and were responsible for all content. Patients older than 18 were eligible if they had resectable stage II–IV (M0) CSCC, for which primary surgery would be recommended in routine clinical practice. Patients with stage II CSCC should have a primary tumour ≥3 cm in longest diameter to be eligible.

After a screening period of up to 28 days, the patients received the neoadjuvant cemiplimab (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals) 350 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression or withdrawal of consent. Imaging assessments were performed at the baseline and at weeks 6 and 12. After completion of neoadjuvant treatment, the protocol window for surgery was study days 75–100. If the patient met the criteria for early discontinuation of cemiplimab during the neoadjuvant period, the treating physician could divert the patient to surgery earlier. Pretreatment biopsy specimens were subjected to histopathological assessment for confirmation of diagnosis and to permit morphologic comparison between tumour tissue before treatment and any residual tumour following therapy.

Staining was performed using antibodies against CD8 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MS-457s), PD-1 (Abcam, ab137132) and PD-L1 (Cell Signaling Technology, 13684S) using a BOND-RX instrument with a Bond Polymer Refine Detection Kit (Leica Biosystems, DS9800). Stained slides were scanned and digitalized using a Scan Scope XT system (Aperio/Leica Biosystems). Single-stain annotations were performed by a pathologist, and staining quantification was done using HALO software (v.2.3.2089.70; Indica Labs). The number of marker-positive cells was calculated and expressed as positive-cell density (number of positive cells per mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed Mann–Whitney &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;-tests using Prism (v.9). &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 was considered to be significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec11"&gt;High-plex, high-dimensional IF staining and analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used the Lunaphore Comet to stain and image the FFPE tissue samples. In brief, FFPE slides were placed in tanks containing BioGenex EZ Elegans AR 2 buffer, enclosed inside a BioGenex EZ Retriever microwave system. The samples were heated in the microwave to 107 °C for 15 min to dewax, rehydrate and retrieve the antigens. After heating, the slides were cooled to room temperature, loaded into the Comet system, and covered and sealed by a fast-fluidic exchange microfluidics chip for staining and imaging in the instrument. The Comet system performs a sequential IF-based staining and imaging followed by an elution of the primary and secondary antibodies. Optimal staining conditions for each antibody panel were determined using the ‘Characterization Part 2’ instrument protocol, in which antibodies are titrated for optimal signal and the elution efficiency is verified by an iterative procedure comprised of staining, imaging, elution and re-imaging for elution confirmation for all antibodies. This study used four mIF panels, described in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09370-8#MOESM11"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; (neuroimmune panel 1; myelin degradation panel; neuroimmune panel 2; and neuroimmune panel 3) for patient-derived tissues. Two panels (m-neuroimmune panel; and m-myelin degradation panel) were used for mouse-derived tissues (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09370-8#MOESM11"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;). The Comet collected images in OME-Tiff formats, which were scanned and then visualized in Comet Viewer (Lunaphore).

A deep learning classifier was trained using specific tissue features from annotated reference images to guide the identification of ROIs. In brief, a tissue ROI was created after training two variables (tissue and non-tissue regions). Tissue and ROI boundaries were then delineated using image analysis smoothing. Aberrant signals, such as those caused by dust particles, tissue folds or air bubbles, were excluded manually from the ROIs. Another deep learner classifier was developed and trained for nerve identification following two training variables (nerve and non-nerve structure) within the delineated tissue ROI regions. Staining for the nerve markers NFH and B3T delineated the nerve within the tissue ROIs. The following training parameters were used to develop the nerve identification app: input: NFH and B3T; learning parameters: learning rate-1.0e-05; Mini-batch size-2; loss function: cross-entropy; iteration: 300,000. Cells in non-nerve areas (NFH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;B3T&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) were identified by watershed desegmentation of the nuclear DAPI signal and removal of incomplete nuclei by size exclusion. The resulting nuclear mask was enlarged by 1.25 μm (5 pixels) to capture nuclear and adjacent cytoplasmic fluorescence signals. A further estimation of the cytoplasm was generated using a dilation of the nuclear mask to a maximum of 3.75 μm (15 pixels). Cell types were identified using a hierarchical decision tree with empirically determined thresholds visually verified across the tissues. NFH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;B3T&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; nerves were segmented using the NFH/B3T signal intensity. Nerve nuclei were excluded a priori from the initial cell classification strategy, and only those that exceeded the threshold for NFH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;B3T&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels were incorporated into the nerve mask. Neural niches were determined to have a 150-μm ROI diameter around each nerve (NFH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;B3T&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). All object-based phenotyping resulting tables were exported as CSV files for downstream analyses. Staining was performed 4–8 min per cycle for primary antibodies, diluted 1:50–1:2000 in a Multistaining Buffer (Lunaphore). Secondary antibodies, AlexaFluor 555 and AlexaFluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were diluted 1:200 and 1:400, respectively, in a multistaining buffer. Tissues were counterstained with DAPI solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at every cycle. Imaging was performed on the Comet at 80 ms for DAPI, 400 ms for AlexaFluor 555, and 200 ms for AlexaFluor 647 at each cycle. Elution was performed for 4 min using an elution buffer (Lunaphore).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec12"&gt;GeoMx DSP experimental design&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;cSCC anti-PD-1 clinical trial FFPE tumour samples were used for DSP of the neural and immune protein expression (see below the description of assays and markers used). First, we mapped the neural niches using haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E)-stained tissue sections, including the tumour and surrounding tissue. These slides were scanned using a Scan Scope digital pathology system (Aperio) in SVS format at a 40× magnification and visualized using Image Scope software (Aperio). All nerve profiles in the specimen were annotated, including PNI. The extent of viable tumour or tumour bed and uninvolved tissue was drawn or designated on whole-slide scans. The respective tumour and surrounding tissue were obtained using the annotations in Aperio files. The nerve density was calculated as the ratio between total number of nerves and the tumour or normal area (mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and the nerve invasion index was calculated as the number of invaded nerves divided by the tumour area (mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, two consecutive 5-μm-thick tissue sections from samples obtained before and after anti-PD-1 therapy were stained according to the semiautomated GeoMx DSP standard protein protocol&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 62" title="NanoString.

Both sections were stained for the following morphology biomarkers: panCK, SYTO 13 (GeoMx Solid Tumour TME Morphology Kit, NanoString, 121300301), β-III-tubulin (EP1569Y, AF, Abcam, ab52623; 1:2,000 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and neurofilament (EPR20020, AF, Abcam, ab207176; 1:1,000 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09370-8#Fig11"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;). Optimization of IF biomarkers was previously performed with different antibody dilutions using normal colon tissue to achieve the highest signal-to-noise ratio. One tumour section was used to profile TANs with the DSP neural cell profiling core (GMX-PROCO-NCT-HNCP-12) and GeoMx Parkinson’s pathology panel (GMX-PROMOD-NCT-HPDP-12). A serial tissue section was used to profile the perineural microenvironment with the following DSP human immuno-oncology protein core panel and modules: GeoMx Immune Cell Profiling (121300101), GeoMx IO Drug Target Assay (121300102), GeoMx Immune Activation Status Assay (121300103) and GeoMx Immune Cell Typing Assay (121300104; 49 protein targets).

ROIs were selected after pathological evaluation of sequential sections of H&amp;amp;E-stained nerve fibres in tumour tissue and tumour bed tissue identified by an expert pathologist (P.N.). Using a two-step strategy, a polygon and rectangle selection tool was applied to select ROIs of up to 660 × 785 mm. (1) Nerve profiling: a slide labelled with a DSP neuroprotein panel was used to select up to 12 intratumoural ROIs containing tumour-associated nerve fibres. Neural niches were identified and segmented using the β-III-tubulin (+), Neurofilament Heavy (NF-H) (+) and panCK (−) phenotype. (2) Perineural niche immune profiling: a consecutive section labelled with a DSP human immuno-oncology protein panel was used to select up to 12 matching ROIs with TANs. The matching perineural microenvironment compartment, that is, neural niches, were identified using the same morphology markers (β-III-tubulin (+), neurofilament heavy (NF-H) (+) and panCK (−) phenotype). Segmented areas (also known as areas of illumination) were illuminated individually using ultraviolet light with the GeoMx DSP device. Oligonucleotide tags conjugated with antibodies present within each area of illumination were photocleaved. Released tags were quantified using nCounter, and tag counts of the various markers were mapped back to their corresponding tissue locations, yielding a spatially resolved digital profile of analyte abundance. Digital counts were normalized using background correction.

Illumina TruSeq adapters were trimmed from the paired-end reads using cutadapt (v.1.18). The trimmed reads were aligned to the GENCODE human reference genome GRCh38 using STAR software (v.2.7.0f). FeatureCounts (subread 1.6.3) was applied to count reads mapped to each gene. Genes were annotated using the gene transfer format file for GRCh38. Read counts were normalized using the trimmed mean of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; method implemented in the R Bioconductor package edgeR to determine the abundance of each gene.

The initial dataset consisted of DEGs from tumours lacking PNI compared with those exhibiting incidental PNI, identified solely through histopathological evaluation (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 2,412). The second dataset included DEGs from tumours with no PNI versus those with clinical PNI, detected using imaging techniques (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 7,793). To curate a gene list that captures the molecular features associated with any form of PNI (both incidental and clinical), we focused on DEGs that were upregulated in both datasets. Further refinement involved excluding genes exhibiting a fold change &amp;lt; 2 and a FDR &amp;gt; 0.001 across both comparisons (no PNI versus incidental PNI and no PNI versus clinical PNI). In our analysis, DEGs represented by multiple microarray probes were excluded if one or more probes failed to satisfy our inclusion criteria. Specifically, cases in which one probe suggested significant upregulation of a gene in PNI-positive cases, while another indicated either downregulation in PNI or no significant difference, were not considered. Ultimately, the final gene set consisted of 46 genes enriched in PNI-positive cases of cSCC of the head and neck (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09370-8#MOESM2"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This 46-gene PNI/nerve injury signature was first tested on our anti-PD-1 neoadjuvant cSCC clinical trial bulk RNA-seq data using GSEA.

Donors provided written informed consent to donate tissue samples for the study, for which the protocol was reviewed and approved by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board. In brief, each donor was undergoing surgical treatment that necessitated ligation of spinal nerve roots to facilitate tumour resection or spinal reconstruction. Spinal roots were ligated proximal to the DRG, spinal roots were sharply cut both proximal and distal to the DRG and excised DRGs were transferred immediately into a cold (&lt;span class="stix"&gt;∼&lt;/span&gt;4 °C) and sterile balanced salt solution containing nutrients. DRGs were transported to the laboratory on ice in a sterile, sealed 50 ml centrifuge tube. After arrival at the laboratory, each ganglion was carefully dissected from the surrounding connective tissues and sectioned into several 1–2 mm pieces, digested in 2 ml of a mixed enzyme solution (0.1% trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, T9201), 0.1% collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, C1764; w/v, final concentration) and 0.01% DNase (Sigma-Aldrich, D5025) diluted in DMEM/F-12), and transferred to a 37 °C rotator to shake at a speed of 124–128 rpm. Every 20 min, tissue fragments were allowed to settle, and the supernatant/dissociated cells were collected and transferred to DMEM/F-12 with an enzyme inhibitor. The supernatant was replaced with 2 ml of fresh digestion solution. The tissue was returned to the 37 °C rotator, and this process was repeated until tissue fragments were completely digested. Dissociated cells were centrifuged at 180 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was removed and the cells were gently resuspended in culture medium with DMEM/F-12 supplemented with EV-free 10% serum and 2 mM glutamine. Cells were plated onto laminin-coated µ-Slide 8 Well (Ibidi) and cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for 24–72 h. hIPS-cell-derived motor (RealMOTO) and sensory neurons (RealDRG) were purchased from Anatomic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec20"&gt;Mouse neurons&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary sensory neurons were isolated from the TG dissected from 6–8-week-old mice as previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 69" title="Malin, S.

Mouse neurons were co-cultured with the mouse oral squamous cell carcinoma MOC1 cell line (Sigma-Aldrich, scc469) and B6-10K (obtained from the laboratory of K.Y.T.). Sensory or motor neurons were cultured to assess the impact of nerves’ degenerative/regenerative status on immunotherapy in vitro. Neurons were plated on laminin-coated (Life Technologies, 23017015) round glass coverslips set in 12-well plates. Then, 2 h after plating, the wells were flooded with 1 ml of warm (37 °C) Ham’s F12 culture medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% EV-depleted fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 95% air. The carcinoma cells were plated (1:10 neuron: cancer cells ratio), and cultures were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% EV-depleted fetal bovine serum in 37 °C and 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; incubation conditions, for 72 h, with or without anti-PD-1 antibody (cemiplimab, 1,000 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, or RMP1-14, 100 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, InVivoMAb Antibodies, BioXCell, for human and mouse, respectively), before neuron sorting and RNA extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec22"&gt;Neuron viability assay&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;TG neurons were obtained from C57BL/6J mice (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8), processed using the above protocol, seeded to 12-well culture plates (3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; total cells per well) and cultured for 72 h. The cultured neurons were then divided into four experimental groups (two wells per group) in which each group was exposed to different culture conditions for an additional 72 h. The first group (control) received no medium change; the second group received fresh medium (20% FBS in Ham’s 12 + penicillin–streptomycin + 1% vitamin); the third group received conditioned medium from the MOC1 mouse oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line previously cultured (10 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; seeded cells in 20% FBS in Ham’s 12 + penicillin–streptomycin + 1% vitamin) for 3 days. The fourth group of neurons was co-cultured with the MOC1 (10 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) cells. After 72 h of exposure, neurons were collected by trypsinization, medium was added (F-15 + 30% FBS) and then live neuro cells were stained with NeuO (membrane-permeable fluorescent dye) dye for 1 h and washed. NeuO-positive cells were sorted by flow cytometry using the CytoFLEX SRT Cell Sorter. RealDRG cryopreserved hPS-cell-derived sensory neurons were obtained from Anatomic. RealDRG neurons were seeded on 0.01% poly-&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-ornithine-coated (Millipore Sigma, A-004-C) µ-slide 8-well ibidi plates (80827) at a density of 0.15 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; total cells per well. The poly-&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-ornithine coating was performed overnight at room temperature in the tissue culture hood, followed by three washes with sterile water. Subsequently, iMatrix-511 silk (Takara, T304) diluted 1:50 in Dulbecco’s PBS (dPBS) was added as a secondary coating and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h after washing off the poly-&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-ornithine. The RealDRG cells were cultured for 10 days to allow for maturation, with half of the Senso MM medium (Anatomic) being replaced every alternate day. After the initial 10-day culture period, the neurons were divided into four experimental groups (two wells per group) and exposed to different culture conditions for an additional 4 days (96 h), aligning with the timeline in the provided PDF. The experimental groups were as follows: fresh medium: cells received fresh Senso MM medium (Anatomic). No medium change: cells were cultured for the entire 14-day period without any medium change. Conditioned medium: cells received conditioned media from B16-F10 (melanoma) and Mia PaCa2 (PDMC) cells. To obtain conditioned medium, B16-F10 and Mia PaCa2 cells were seeded at 10 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; cells in Senso MM medium and cultured for 24 h. The medium was then replaced, and the supernatant was collected after another 24 h, filtered with a 0.22 µm filter and stored at 4 °C. This process was repeated, and the two collections were mixed at a 1:1 ratio. Co-culture: cells were co-cultured with 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; seeded B16-F10 (melanoma) and Mia PaCa2 (PDMC) cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Immunofluorescence staining and imaging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the 4-day exposure period, the mature neurons from µ-slide 8-well ibidi plates were fixed with 4% buffered formalin. Neurons were then stained with NFH antibody (ab4680, Abcam) followed by a secondary Texas Red-conjugated antibody. Images were acquired using the Cytation 7 imaging reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell counts and neurite morphology were assessed using the neurite outgrowth module of the Gen5 Cytation 7 software. The experiment included four conditions (fresh medium, no medium change, conditioned medium and co-culture), with two wells per condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;Neurite quantification&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;rDRGs were plated in duplicate wells in an 8-well Ibidi plate and assigned to one of four conditions: (1) fresh medium; (2) no medium change; (3) conditioned medium; or (4) direct co-culture with either B16-F10 or Mia PaCa-2 cells. Cell viability was confirmed using NeuO staining in the GFP channel before fixation. Cells were then fixed and stained with neurofilament heavy chain (NFH, Texas Red channel) to assess neuronal morphology and with DAPI to label nuclei. Using a ×20 magnification, multichannel fluorescence images were taken as a 12 × 12 image montage from the centre of each well in an 8-well Ibidi plate. The Agilent BioTek Cytation 5 cell imaging multimode reader was used for all image acquisition. A minimum of ten ROIs per condition was selected based on consistent cell density. ROIs were excluded if they exhibited low cell density or imaging artifacts. Morphological analysis and thresholding for the selection of neurons and assessment of neuronal morphology were completed using the neurite outgrowth module in Gen5 Cytation 7 software. We assessed neurite length and thickness across the four conditions, with two wells per condition. The Gen5 neurite outgrowth module analysis automatically provides results for both image-level metrics, such as total outgrowth length per image and cell-level average values, like the per-cell average neurite length. Default thresholding for soma selection was applied to exclude weak NFH signal in the TexasRed channel, and neurons were selected and distinguished from cancer cells by using the ‘optimize soma using nuclear signal’ setting for DAPI staining and by selecting for cells with NFH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; protrusions extending more than 20 µm from the cell, which represent neurites (dendrites and axons). ‘Only keep neurites connected to a soma’, ‘Discard short neurites’ and ‘Discard short ending branches’ were selected in the ‘Neurite’ settings window, with short neurites under 20 µm excluded and short ending branches under 5 µm excluded to ensure that only the true intact neurite signal was studied. From these 8–10 final ROIs, we exported morphology data from the manually programmed neurite outgrowth module. The metrics reported from each ROI were the average neurite length (µm) and the average neurite thickness (calculated as NFH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; area divided by neurite length in µm).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec25"&gt;MEA for cell lines&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 24-well CytoView MEA plate (Axion, M384-tMEA-24W) electrodes were prepared for culturing realDRG according to the Anatomic protocol (&lt;a href="https://www.anatomic.com/_files/ugd/a239f4_97800271c1964458aa21c9a9008849a3.pdf"&gt;https://www.anatomic.com/_files/ugd/a239f4_97800271c1964458aa21c9a9008849a3.pdf&lt;/a&gt;). In brief, around 7 ml cell-culture-grade water with penicillin–streptomycin was added to the outer rim of the plate. Then, electrodes were coated with 50 μl per well of 0.01% PLO for 1 h at room temperature. PLO was washed off four times with 500 μl cell-culture-grade water, ensuring complete removal between washes. Then, 50 μl of iMatrix-511 SILK (Takara, T304) diluted 1:50 in dPBS per well was added as a secondary coating and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The human realDRG cells were quickly thawed in a water bath, collected in fresh F12 medium (20% FBS, 1% penicillin–streptomycin), centrifuged at 300 rpm for 4 min and resuspended in Senso MM media (Anatomic). The realDRGs were plated at 20,000 and 50,000 cells per well. Basal spontaneous firing rate of iPS-cell-derived sensory neurons assessed by MEA. After 10 days in normal culture, mature, firing neurons were cultured for 6 days under control conditions, stressed conditions (no medium exchange), in MOC1 conditioned medium or in MOC1-co-culture. Spontaneous firing rates were recorded at the baseline, 24 and 72 h. The mean firing rate of iPS-cell-derived sensory neurons co-cultured with MIA PaCa-2 cells (20,000 or 50,000 cells per well) over 5 days was measured by MEA. RealDRGs were plated at 20,000 and 50,000 cells per well on 24-well CytoView MEA plates, with medium changes every 48 h. After 8–9 days in culture, mature neurons started firing spontaneously and, at day 10, all neurons established stable spontaneous activity. After 10 days in normal culture, mature firing neurons were cultured for 6 days under control conditions, stressed conditions (no medium exchange), in Mia-PaCa2-conditioned medium or in Mia-PaCa2 co-culture. The spontaneous functional activity of the realDRGs was recorded for a minimum of 10 min and every 24 h for 6 days (days 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism. Error bars in the figures represent the s.e.m. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple -comparisons test was used to determine statistical significance between groups, with a significance level of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec26"&gt;Neuron mRNA library preparation and sequencing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA was isolated from cultured neurons using total RNA was extracted using the RecoverALL Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA libraries were prepared and sequenced at the University of Houston Sequencing and Editing Core according to standard protocols. Enrichment for mRNA from total RNA was performed by coding-region-specific biotinylated capture probes, which were selected using streptavidin magnetic beads. mRNA-enriched libraries were prepared using the QIAseq Stranded Total RNA Kit (Qiagen) with 200 ng of input RNA. RNA was fragmented, reverse-transcribed into cDNA, ligated with sequence adaptors and amplified by PCR. Size selection for libraries was performed using SPRIselect beads (Beckman Coulter). The library purity was analysed using the DNA HS1000 tape with a 4200 TapeStation system (Agilent) and the Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The prepared libraries were pooled and sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 system (Illumina), using an S4 flow cell at paired-end 150 bp configuration at 20–30 million read depth for each sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec27"&gt;Neuron transcriptome analyses&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The raw sequencing data (FASTQ files) were imported into Qiagen CLC Genomics Workbench 20.0.4. Initial quality control of the sequencing reads was performed using the built-in tools, including the Quality Control function, to evaluate read quality metrics, such as read length distribution, quality scores and potential adapter contamination. Low-quality reads and contaminants were trimmed or filtered out. The cleaned sequencing reads were mapped to the GRCh38.p14 reference genome using the Map Reads to Reference tool in the CLC Genomics Workbench. Gene expression levels were quantified using the Count Features tool. This step involved counting the number of reads mapped to each gene based on the annotation file corresponding to the reference genome. The output generated a count table indicating the raw read counts for each gene across all samples. Read counts were normalized using the trimmed mean of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; method implemented in the R Bioconductor package edgeR (v.4.2.1)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 71" title="Chen, Y., Chen, L., Lun, A.

A minimum of five mice per experimental group was used to ensure that appropriate statistical analyses could be conducted. This determination was made based on our preliminary data, the implementation of internal controls and the observed variability within the experimental groups. In each experiment conducted, all efforts to replicate the results were successful. All animal studies were carried out according to protocols approved by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (protocols 00000950-RN03, 00001522-RN01, 00001522-RN02, 00002342-RN00), NYU, Queen’s University (protocols 2380 and 2393), and Université de Montréal (protocols 21046 and 21047) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mouse housing, husbandry and care practices met or exceeded the minimum requirements outlined in the Animal Welfare Act and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th Edition). Disease development and progression were closely monitored. According to our approved protocol, mice with metastases were euthanized as soon as we noticed signs of discomfort in the mice or when the largest dimension of a tumour reached 20 mm. In none of the experiments were these limits exceeded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec33"&gt;Animal housing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were housed in standard environmental conditions (12 h–12 h light–dark cycle; 23 °C; food and water ad libitum) at facilities accredited by the Canadian Council of Animal Care (UdeM and Queen’s University).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec34"&gt;IACUC end points&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per our IACUC-approved protocol, the following end points have been used in all the experiments and have not been exceeded. Along with excessive body weight loss (maximum of 10%), the end points include excessive tumour volume (10% of animal’s body weight; ~20 mm × 20 mm, not exceeded in any experiment), skin ulceration, necrosis, bleeding, infection and self-inflicted injury, prostration, lethargy, unresponsiveness to stimulation and/or lack of grooming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec35"&gt;B6 UV-induced skin SCC cell lines&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To generate murine skin SCC cell lines, p53-deficient (K14Cre; &lt;i&gt;p53&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;R172H/flox&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) C57BL/6 mice (4–6-week-old, both males and females) were exposed to 7 kJ m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of ultraviolet B light, 3 doses per week for 100 days.

Skin tumours (minimum 5 mm in diameter and persistent for at least 2 weeks) started to develop 9 months after the end of the UV-exposure protocol. Each tumour was split in half. One section was processed for FFPE, H&amp;amp;E stained and IF staining with anti-pan-keratin (type I) was performed for confirmation of cSCC diagnosis. The remaining tissue section was macrodissected and incubated in cell culture medium for 7–10 days. The cultured cells were sorted using the CD326 (EPCAM) antibody, and the resulting isolated epithelial cells were again incubated in cell culture medium, IF stained with anti-pan-keratin (type I) (E6S1S) antibody and DAPI to confirm their epithelial origin. The isolated malignant keratinocytes were injected intradermally (200,000 cells per 60 μl) into C57BL/6 WT mice, and their tumorigenicity was recorded. The newly developed tumours were assessed using H&amp;amp;E staining to confirm the histopathological diagnosis of cSCC. This process resulted in five distinct UVSCC cell lines (M2, M3, M4, M5 and M6) (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09370-8#Fig8"&gt;3b&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec36"&gt;In vivo nerve injury modulation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used denervation and surgical axotomy to assess in vivo nerve injury modulation of the immune response.

All procedures were approved by the New York University Institutional Animal Care. Animals were housed in a temperature-controlled, pathogen-free room under a 12 h–12 h light–dark cycle (06:00–18:00) with ad libitum access to food and water. The MOC2 mouse oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (Sigma Chemicals) were cultured in IMDM/F12 (2:1 mixture) with 5% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 1% amphotericin, 5 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; EGF (Millipore), 400 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; hydrocortisone and 5 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; insulin. Under 3% isoflurane anaesthesia, 20 μl of MOC2 cells (5,000 cells total) in serum-free culture medium was injected into the left whisker pad using a 10 μl Hamilton syringe. The mice were randomly allocated to four groups. The experimental groups were defined by the interval between cancer cell injection and the subsequent euthanasia of the animals, resulting in tumour development periods of 7, 9, 11 and 13 days. The tumours were processed for histological assessment and mIF staining, focusing on identifying PNI by tumour cells and characterizing the perineural immune infiltrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec39"&gt;MEA analysis of mouse tissue&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mouse tumours were quickly dissected from euthanized animals (orthotopic B610K intradermal model in SKH1-Elite animals and normal skin controls) and analysed by P.D.V.’s laboratory, as previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 77" title="Restaino, A.

One tumour slice/sample was formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded and processed for histological staining (H&amp;amp;E) to assess tumour presence. Electrical recordings were captured using a MEA1060-Inv-BC microelectrode array system (Multichannel Systems) with a perforated microelectrode array, 60pMEA100/30iR-Ti MEAs (890335, Harvard Apparatus). The MEAs used contained 60 electrodes, of which one is a reference electrode. These electrodes are spaced 100 µm apart in a 6 × 10 grid (ten electrodes per row arranged in six columns generating a rectangle of electrodes onto which tissue slice is placed); each electrode is 30 µm in diameter. The titanium nitride electrodes are contained within a glass ring, enabling us to maintain tissue slices under oxygenated (95% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 26.2 mM NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 11 mM glucose, 1.3 mM MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 1.5 mM CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); this buffer preserves neuronal functions. The perforated MEAs allow for a gentle suction (applied by a vacuum pump) to keep the tissue slice in contact with electrodes for the duration of recordings. This enables us to capture the electrical activity from every electrode for every second of each recording. As such, recordings from 59 electrodes per second per slice were collected (one electrode is a reference electrode). Recordings occurred at room temperature using a 25-kHz sampling frequency and a Butterworth second-order digital filter set to high-pass with a cut-off frequency of 10 Hz (to eliminate slow FPs). A STG4000 stimulus generator (Multichannel Systems) was used for stimulation, which consisted of biphasic voltage, −0.5 V and +0.5 V each for 100 µs and repeated after a 23 ms interval. Stimulation was applied to selected electrodes; evoked spike responses were recorded. Two independent types of stimulations were used on each slice. The first consisted of 14 electrodes while the second consisted of 20 electrodes. The same electrode sets were stimulated for all slices analysed and the stimulation parameters were identical. Recordings continued after electrical stimulations were turned off to allow for capturing of activity back to baseline. In all cases, continuous electrical activity per second per electrode recordings were captured and analysed using the MC_Rach4.6.2 software (Multichannel Systems).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec40"&gt;TEM analysis of mouse samples&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;TEM analysis was conducted on mouse tissue samples from a previously established model of PNI in the sciatic nerve&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 78" title="Salvo, E. et al.

In brief, mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Sciatic nerves were dissected and fixed for 2 h. Fixation was performed using a modified reduced osmium impregnation method. The samples were embedded in fresh 100% durcupan. The processed samples were sectioned (1 µm) and stained with 1% toluidine blue to identify the areas of interest. Thinner sections (70 nm) were mounted onto slot grids and loaded onto the Zeiss grid holder for EM imaging. Images were taken with a beam acceleration of 20.0 kV and a working distance of approximately 2.0 mm, capturing 6,144 px by 4,608 px images with a pixel size of 100 nm to 200 nm. A Talos120C transmission electron microscope with the Gatan (4k × 4k) OneView Camera was used for high-resolution EM imaging.

Then, 2 weeks later, the mice were euthanized, and lung metastases were visually confirmed in the B16F10-eGFP-inoculated group. Jugular nodose ganglia (JNC) were dissected into ice-cold HEPES-buffered DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 12430062). For each biological replicate, JNC from four mice (two male, two female) were pooled and transferred into HEPES-buffered DMEM containing 1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; collagenase IV (Sigma-Aldrich, C5138) and 2.4 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; dispase II (Sigma-Aldrich, 04942078001), then incubated at 37 °C for 70 min. After washing with DMEM, ganglia were gently triturated using glass Pasteur pipettes of decreasing diameter. Cells were centrifuged at 200&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; over a 15% BSA gradient in PBS to remove debris, stained with SYTO 40 (10 μM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, S11351) for 5 min at room temperature to distinguish cells from axonal debris, washed with PBS and resuspended in sterile flow cytometry buffer (PBS with 2% FBS and 1 mM EDTA).

Library preparation was conducted at the Institut de Recherche en Cancérologie et en Immunologie (IRIC), Université de Montréal. The RNA quality was confirmed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer, with all samples achieving an RNA integrity number of ≥7.5. Libraries were prepared using a poly(A)-enrichment, single-stranded RNA-seq method (KapaBiosystems, KAPA RNA Hyperprep Kit, KR1352) and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq500 platform with 75-cycle single-end reads. Basecalling was performed using Illumina RTA v.2.4.11, and demultiplexing was done using bcl2fastq v.2.20 (allowing for one mismatch in the index). Trimmomatic was used to remove adapter sequences and low-quality bases from the 3′ end of each read, and the resulting high-quality reads were aligned to the GRCm38 mouse genome using STAR v.2.5.11, which also generated gene-level read counts. Differential expression analysis was performed using edgeR. The generalized linear model likelihood ratio test from edgeR was used to identify significant DEGs between groups. Genes were considered to be differentially expressed if they had an FDR-adjusted &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05. log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-transformed fold changes and −log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;-transformed &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were calculated from the normalized data, and additional data analysis and visualization were carried out in RStudio.

Then, 7 days later, tumour-infiltrating neurons (or neurons in MPEK-injected skin) were retrogradely labelled by an acute intratumour injection of AAV9-CAG-mCherry-WPRE-SV40p (10 µl, 5.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;). Then, 14 days after inoculation, the mice were euthanized, and the L3–L5 DRG was collected and digested. Most CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were depleted using the MagniSort mouse CD45 depletion kit (Invitrogen, 8804-6864). The remaining neurons were resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS with 2% FCS and EDTA) and stained with Viability Dye eFluor 780 (eBioscience, 65-0865-14) at 4 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, nuclei were stained with SYTO 40 (10 µM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, S11351) for 5 min at room temperature to distinguish cells from axonal debris. Cells were then purified by FACS on the BD FACSAria IIu cell sorter and subjected to single-cell barcoding using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ GEM, Library and Gene Expression v3.1 system (10x Genomics). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq X platform, generating 120 million total reads. Reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome using Cell Ranger (10x Genomics) and analysed with Seurat. Low-RNA-content and dead cells were excluded (nFeature_RNA &amp;gt; 100, percent.mt &amp;lt; 5%). AAV9 expression was not detected and therefore subsequent analysis was performed using principal component analysis, which identified 19 clusters, which were assigned cell types using known markers and the Tabula Muris reference atlas. Clusters were grouped into major cell types, and cells that were not classified as neurons were excluded from the analysis. Four biological replicates per group were analysed to compare B16F10-injected mice and keratinocyte-injected mice.

Then, 10 days after tumour inoculation, the tumours were excised, minced with a razor blade and digested for 30 min in DMEM containing 10 mM HEPES, 1.6 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; collagenase IV (Sigma-Aldrich, C5138) and 10 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich, 4942078001). The resulting cell suspensions were filtered through a 40 μm mesh, and samples from two mice were pooled for each experiment. After red blood cell lysis (Gibco, A10492-01), cells were stained with Zombie Aqua viability dye (BioLegend, 423105) and a FITC anti-mouse CD45 antibody (BioLegend, 103107). Approximately 500,000 live immune cells, which included around 80% CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells, were sorted on the BD FACSAria III cell sorter into a collection buffer (PBS, 0.04% BSA and 50% FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, F4135), then fixed and prepared for single-cell library construction using the Chromium 10x Fixed RNA kits (PN-1000414 and PN-1000497). Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq X system and reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome using Cell Ranger (10x Genomics). Count matrices were generated and analysed in Seurat. Next, low-quality cells, potential doublets and multiplets were removed. Batch effect was corrected using canonical correlation analysis in Seurat. The threshold for dead cells was percent.mt &amp;lt; 10. The threshold to remove low-quality cells, potential doublets and multiplets were nFeature_RNA &amp;gt; 200 and nFeature_RNA &amp;lt; 2500. Identification of the major immune phenotypes was performed based on the expression of key phenotypical markers (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09370-8#Fig14"&gt;9i&lt;/a&gt;).

Tumours were harvested and enzymatically digested in DMEM + 5% FBS (Seradigm, 3100) + 2 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; collagenase D (Sigma, 11088866001) + 1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Collagenase IV (Sigma, C5138-1G) + 40 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; DNAse I (Sigma, 10104159001) under constant shaking (40 min, 37 °C). The cell suspension was centrifuged at 400&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 70% Percoll gradient (GE Healthcare), overlaid with 40% Percoll and centrifuged at 500&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 20 min at room temperature with acceleration and deceleration at 1. The cells were aspirated from the Percoll interface and passed through a 70-μm cell strainer. Single-cell suspensions were prepared in FACS buffer (PBS containing 2% FCS and EDTA) and stained with either Zombie Aqua (BioLegend, 423102) for 15 min at room temperature or Viability Dye eFluor 780 (eBioscience, 65-0865-14) for 15 min at 4 °C. After washing, cells were incubated with Fc Block (0.5 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; BD Biosciences, 553141) for 20 min at 4 °C, then stained for 30 min at 4 °C with anti-CD45-FITC (1:100; BioLegend, 103107) and anti-CD8-PerCP/Cyanine5.5 (1:100; BioLegend, 100733). For cytokine expression analysis, cells were stimulated in vitro for 3 h with PMA (50 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; Sigma-Aldrich, P1585), ionomycin (1 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; Sigma-Aldrich, I3909) and GolgiStop (1:100; BD Biosciences, 554724). They were then fixed and permeabilized (1:100; BD Biosciences, 554714), stained with anti-IFN-γ-APC (1:100; BioLegend, 505810) and analysed on a Cytoflex (Beckman) flow cytometer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec49"&gt;Immunofluorescence analysis of &lt;i&gt;ATF3&lt;/i&gt; expression in melanoma-innervating neurons&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; B16F10-OVA-mCherry melanoma cells were injected intradermally into the right hindpaw of C57BL/6 mice or &lt;i&gt;Atf3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;GFP/GFP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Then, 14 days after inoculation, the mice were anaesthetized with urethane (Sigma-Aldrich, U2500, 20%, 250 μl, i.p.) and perfused with 10 ml of PBS followed by 10 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma-Aldrich, 158127). The ipsilateral (tumour-bearing paw) and contralateral (control paw) L3–L5 DRGs were collected, post-fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h at 4 °C and then immersed sequentially in 10%, 20% and 30% sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, S8501) for 24 h each. The tissues were embedded in Fisher Healthcare Tissue-Plus O.C.T. Compound (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23-730-571), frozen at –80 °C and cryosectioned into 15–30 μm sections. The sections were blocked in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 5% BSA and 5% goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich, G9023) for 2 h at room temperature, then incubated at 4 °C for 48 h with rabbit anti-mouse ATF3 (1:100, Abcam, ab207434) and chicken anti-mouse TUBB3 (1:500, Abcam, ab41489) in staining solution (PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 3% goat serum). After three 15-minute washes in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100, the sections were incubated at 4 °C for 16 h with AF488 anti-chicken (1:1,000, Abcam, ab150169) and AF647 anti-rabbit (1:1,000, Invitrogen, A-21245) antibodies. The samples were then washed and stained with DAPI (2 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, Invitrogen, D1306) for 10 min at room temperature. Images were acquired using the Nikon Ti2 microscope equipped with a Photometrics Prime 95B camera. Using ImageJ or Nikon Elements software, circular ROIs were drawn around each neuron and nucleus. The mean grey values for ATF3 and TUBB3 fluorescence (in a.u.) within each ROI were exported for further analysis in Microsoft Excel. The ratio of ATF3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons to TUBB3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons was determined, indicating increased ATF3 expression in ipsilateral (tumour-bearing) L3–L5 DRGs compared with the contralateral side. In parallel, a threshold-based method was also applied to define the relative number of ATF3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; nuclei, which also show increased relative expression in ipsilateral (tumour-bearing) L3–L5 DRGs neurons. Values from &lt;i&gt;Atf3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;GFP/GFP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice independently validated these findings and are not shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec50"&gt;Statistical analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unpaired Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were conducted to analyse immunohistochemical, in vitro and mouse data. Survival was analysed using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate nominal statistical significance. Owing to the variance of xenograft growth in control mice, we used at least three mice per genotype to give 80% power to detect an effect size of 20% with a significance level of 0.05. The number of independent mice used is listed in the figure legend for all mouse experiments. No statistical methods were used to predetermine the sample size. The experiments were not randomized, and investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. To assess differences in cytokine levels between groups, we used a nested one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to account for both technical and biological replicates, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. The cytokine levels were standardized by calculating &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; scores based on the mean for plotting purposes. To compare tumour growth in mouse models under different interventions, tumour volume was recorded at multiple timepoints. In this way, we used a mixed-effects model (REML) to compare tumour growth curves and account for repeated tumour measures. Intervention groups, time and their interaction were considered to be fixed effects, and individual animals were considered to be random factors.

Health experts are warning people to avoid dusty outdoor environments as they could breathe in the coccidioides spores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Thousands of Californians have been struck down by incurable fungus on the West Coast dubbed 'new American epidemic'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The number of Valley Fever cases peaked for the first time in a decade in 2021.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 20,970 recorded instances were the most on record for a single year since the last peak in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instances declined in 2022 but picked back up last year, and experts are concerned over an expected surge of the fungus in the coming decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC estimates Valley Fever could infect more than half a million Americans each year in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency said that due to rising temperatures across the globe, the endemic region of the disease will spread north to include dry western areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other experts fear that it could be endemic in 17 states by 2100. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;California Department of Public Health director Dr Erica Pan said: 'California had a record year for Valley fever in 2024 and, so far, case counts are high in 2025. Valley fever is a serious illness that's here to stay in California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We want to remind Californians, travelers to California, and their healthcare providers to watch for signs and symptoms of Valley fever to help detect it early.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no person-to-person transmission of the disease, for which there is currently no preventative vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Valley Fever can often resolve on its own without treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For more severe or persistent cases, antifungal medications are used to manage symptoms and prevent the infection from worsening or spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn that Valley Fever can often be missed by doctors or misdiagnosed as pneumonia as it presents similar symptoms such as fatigue, cough, fever, aching muscles and breathlessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other symptoms include night sweats, joint aches and a red rash, usually on the legs but occasionally on the chest, arms and back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the disease is often underdiagnosed due to mild symptoms, the CDC estimates that the true burden is around 206,000 to 360,000 cases per year - 10 to 18 times more than reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The fungus spore is whipped up into the air when the soil is disturbed by the wind or digging. When humans or animals breathe in the spores, they travel through the respiratory tract and into the lungs where they reproduce&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But up to 10 percent of infections become severe and take months to recover from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In these cases, known as disseminated coccidioidomycosis, the disease can spread through the bloodstream to other parts of the body, including the brain, skin and liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If it infects the membranes and fluid around the brain it can cause life-threatening meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To prevent the disease from reaching advanced stages, Dr Pan advises: 'If you have been sick with symptoms like cough, fever, trouble breathing, and tiredness for more than seven to ten days, please talk to a healthcare provider about Valley fever, especially if you've been outdoors in dusty air in the Central Valley or Central Coast regions.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, there were approximately 200 coccidioidomycosis-associated deaths each year from 1999 to 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research suggests the rise and spread of Valley fever may be linked to changes in climate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wet winters after droughts help the fungus grow, and dry, windy weather in the following summer and fall can help the fungus get into the air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shaun Yang, the director for molecular microbiology and pathogen genomics at the UCLA Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, told SFGate: 'I think climate change is the main reason to explain this type of dramatic explosion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The infection was dubbed Valley Fever because 97 percent of cases are found in Arizona and California&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don't think anything else can explain this type of phenomenon. This kind of very wet and dry pattern definitely is perfect for this fungus to grow.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no proven treatment for Valley Fever and patients are usually prescribed rest and given therapies to manage symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors may prescribe antifungal medications, but there is no evidence from clinical trials that show these treatments are effective - and antifungal drugs come with the potential for serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 1996, the Valley Fever Center for Excellence at the University of Arizona, was established in order to address the problems caused by the coccidioides fungus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two-thirds of all Valley Fever infections in the US occur in Arizona, mostly in the urban areas surrounding Phoenix and Tucson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, the University of Arizona &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14106151/cdc-report-pet-dogs-spread-rare-disease.html"&gt;Valley Fever &lt;/a&gt;Center for Excellence secured $33 million from the National Institute of Health to pursue a vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its director, Dr John Galgiani, helped develop one for dogs THAT is still undergoing licensing for commercial marketing. But it is hoped the VACCINE could translate to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've been thinking about a human vaccine all along but taking this through the dog is really a very useful step to show proof of the concept, making the idea of taking it to humans that much more attractive,' Mr Galgiani said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 19:28:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxOaVppQ2dvaXlLbWFCbDJaZENLYzBtTXA1MlJrdmo1azBCTWhMeHhOdmpxMXZ3ZFJ3ck9qbUtxN09uYzBPbXJRNnVCdDFZU3pwNzByUWx4ZWdBNXo5RU9FVXNreGtoNlN0czZRZ0pOeFFsUVJUMnpndnpKb21VQVozaGx0Z3o0YXZtOVFzNnk2cHlFQVJXV1FieUlTSGxHWG9WblVMYUlpVWd1RXVI0gGyAUFVX3lxTE8yZTNGQnJBQnB4eWJXWlJqSEVHWEVBUjdUSGdnSUNJY3JOc05wenBYdng0cVMxcEhXLUdTbU1aNWhHanY0Y2hkYnh5RmVfX1l6REpOWklCV2RNNmdacGVtMElZSmFwWEg0Sm96NUN4MEtGRlMxajQwR1hod1JEcDJoaTFpZlBBNkRKUHVuUFBsbTgwVXR6TEVpWlBqbWY0LU53NlkwYUNOa19UczB3V3hWcHc</guid></item><item><title>南太浩湖露营后，加州居民鼠疫检测呈阳性- KSBY新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQNmcwUEVzMHpiN2dCUEwtazNFQXJNTEh1VHpwMnk0V0ptRXBDbW9WcUV5MUJfdDFucVFrTUd1Mzc2c3RoaTMxdkI0TUhaTEtCTWcwRkNsR0ktUlBrY1R0bjd4aFFWUjMtaXhWWFN0eVl1cTNGMklZWk9PNmtJZVBPaUxJb1ZvQ0xqUVRrQVA5aW83bEV0ZmU0X2Q3QklVSjJ4ejFlc1hKNjM5Nlk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;California health officials said an individual living in South Lake Tahoe has tested positive for the plague after recently camping in the area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to officials with El Dorado County, the individual is recovering at home under the care of a medical professional. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South Lake Tahoe resident believes they may have been bitten by an infected flea while camping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scripps News has reached out to El Dorado County health officials to clarify which type of plague the case has been identified as. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common type of plague is bubonic, which is caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium and primarily transmitted through rodent flea bites. The two other types of plague are pneumonic or septicemic, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plague can be deadly if it is not treated promptly with antibiotics, the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases of the plague are extremely rare in the U.S., with an average of seven cases reported per year since 2000, according to data from the CDC. Even rarer are deaths attributed to the plague, with the last death in the U.S. occurring in 2021 before a deadly case earlier this year in Arizona. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said plague is naturally present in parts of California; however, the most recent case reported in El Dorado County was in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RELATED STORY | &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/health/person-dies-from-bubonic-plague-in-northern-arizona"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Person dies from a case of the plague in northern Arizona&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health routinely conducts surveillance on wildlife to test for plague cases. There have been 41 rodents, including squirrels or chipmunks, that have tested positive for the plague from 2021 to 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far in 2025, health officials said four additional rodents have tested positive for the plague, and all of them were found in the Tahoe area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Here's what we know.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MISSOURI, USA — Missouri health officials on Wednesday confirmed that a patient who contracted a &lt;a href="/article/news/health/missouri-rare-brain-eating-amoeba-case-naegleria-fowleri-lake-of-the-ozarks/63-9799c185-cece-4441-85bb-81794eb7e9a3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;rare infection from a brain-eating amoeba at the Lake of the Ozarks&lt;/a&gt; has died.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient died at a St. Louis area hospital on Tuesday, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said in an emailed statement. The department extended its condolences to the loved ones of the patient.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient was infected with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/a&gt;, which is naturally present in warm freshwater and is often found during the summer months.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Symptoms get worse pretty rapidly and most people actually pass away within about five days," Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services Epidemiologist Nathan Koffarnus previously told 5 On Your Side.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human infection has historically been extremely rare, with only 167 reported cases of the infection in the United States between 1962-2024. The last time a Naegleria fowleri infection was &lt;a href="https://health.mo.gov/news/newsitem/uuid/ea19a071-5c03-495c-9b62-69db69078d4e/missouri-dhss-confirms-case-of-rare-brain-infection#:~:text=Naegleria%2520fowleri%2520is%2520a%2520microscopic,care%2520unit%2520of%2520a%2520hospital." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;confirmed in Missouri was in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. The only other confirmed case in the state was in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Naegleria fowleri infections have historically been rare, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jeu.12964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; warns that warming temperatures and increasingly frequent floods caused by human-induced climate change are making infections occur more often.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba thrives in temperatures between 80 and 115 degrees, which is outside the livable range of competing microorganisms, according to&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jeu.12964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; research published in 2023&lt;/a&gt;. Lakes and rivers are becoming hotter due to climate change, and stronger storms are increasing the amount of organic matter that ends up in the waterways through flooding, creating the perfect storm for Naegleria fowleri populations to spike.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

A recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article/112/7/znaf102/8191209" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; suggests that compared to people born in 1950, those born in 1990 have twice the risk of developing colon cancer. Lifestyle factors such as poor diet, lack of physical activity, obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption play a crucial role in the early onset. Early diagnosis is crucial for treatment outcomes and survival. This is why awareness around the disease, its symptoms, and prevention is crucial. Here are some of the warning symptoms of colon cancer you should not ignore. Take a look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Changes in bowel habits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice any changes in your poop, do not ignore them. Yes, that's right. How you poop really matters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7079267/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have consistently shown that colorectal patients complain of changes in bowel habits. Any changes, such as constipation, diarrhea, narrowing, or frequency of your poop, should not be dismissed. If these symptoms persist lasts more than a few weeks, you should consult your healthcare provider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Blood in your poop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rectal bleeding is a hallmark sign of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1920716/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have shown that rectal bleeding, along with other factors, is predictive of colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice blood in the poop on toilet paper, consult your doctor right away. The presence of blood can appear as dark or bright red patches in the poop. Though other conditions, such as hemorrhoids, too, could lead to rectal bleeding, it is important to find out the cause behind it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Belly pain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ache in your abdominal area is another significant sign of colon cancer. If you experience pain in the belly, with no known cause, talk to your doctor. A 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10116569/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that abdominal pain was the most common symptom (63%) in young patients with colorectal cancer. The pain may feel like cramps or bloating, and won't go away, and hurt a lot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Unexplained weight loss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight loss is a common and often early symptom of colon cancer. If you notice sudden weight loss without a known reason, it should not be dismissed. Weight loss, without even changing your diet or fitness levels, should be a cause of concern. This sign is noticeable, and you shouldn't ignore it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;6 Foods that help you poop better and relieve constipation in the morning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Constant fatigue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you experience persistent tiredness, it's a red flag. Feeling tired, even after a good night's sleep, is a common symptom in people with colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4999562/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; is not normal. The lack of energy should not be dismissed.

No other information about the person or the person's condition was released. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-720455" class="body-graf"&gt;Officials believe the sick person was bitten by an infected flea while camping in the South Lake Tahoe area, the release said. Officials are investigating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9824f6" class="body-graf"&gt;Plague is caused by bacteria that are most often transmitted via bites from fleas that were already carrying the bacteria after picking it up from squirrels, chipmunks and other rodents, according to health officials. Dogs and cats could also bring plague-infected fleas into homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b8fcae" class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms of plague usually include fever, nausea, weakness and swollen lymph nodes, and show up within two weeks of exposure. It can be treated effectively with antibiotics if it's diagnosed early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ffefad" class="body-graf"&gt;Public health officials in California monitor rodents in the area to determine if they carry plague, the release said. From 2021 to 2024, 41 rodents were found to have been exposed to the plague bacteria. Four additional rodents tested positive in 2025, all identified in the Tahoe Basin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d4e984" class="body-graf"&gt;El Dorado County officials noted how rare human cases of plague are, with the last reported case in the South Lake Tahoe area in 2020. Prior to that, two people tested positive for plague in 2015 after exposure in Yosemite National Park. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3bfc80" class="body-graf"&gt;"Plague is naturally present in many parts of California, including higher elevation areas of El Dorado County," said Kyle Fliflet, El Dorado County's Acting Director of Public Health. "It's important that individuals take precautions for themselves and their pets when outdoors, especially while walking, hiking and or camping in areas where wild rodents are present."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0bbdfc" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;In order to prevent contracting plague, officials warned that people and pets should not touch squirrels, chipmunks or other wild rodents, especially those that are dead or injured. People should not camp near where dead rodents were observed and should wear long pants tucked into boots and spray bug repellant to reduce flea exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 17:53:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNR3dUbExBbXBSMnJzNGczQVRQbXg1bVZxcHV5dlBPTFctVTgyZ1JqZG1wNEpjMzFTVFlvZU14dm5IR0g1V2pMaDJXT0c3UjFHV3FJdENzaGpuX21PdFFYSzhkQ01OX2I2N2VsV0w1Y0t0TktsRFhYeVlmWWNydmFOaVF0VlI3a0tzTTl5UGl2c09lVE5iZkt0RXBVdDNkZHN5THFhVy03aWkwMjlyUl9qRGtDM3JCOXZBMUHSAVZBVV95cUxNQktDdG5ibnhoZkpkVHBxY3IzbXZuaEFQMllFOWpHMjdpSnBrT0dNT2x1dnYwamgtMnBOS1pRRXhqa3VBT2hpX3dEdF8yYVdqR3VoSy03dw</guid></item><item><title>1990年麻疹爆发表明疾病如何咆哮-纽约时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxOb2UzNlNDMkxFQ3k1NnptM3I3QkE3c2RaTVNBb243Z2NMbnVDQ2ZNTjRlS1hLSjJnVkJoZFRmMy1IVjFqd2F5aUVqdWZIQlJiSDllSFU1RXVGR0xWNzFmejJPMEt3enQzQmZ6RFhKamZqQmNsdDUtS0FobXptMjE4ZWR3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 17:50:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOb2UzNlNDMkxFQ3k1NnptM3I3QkE3c2RaTVNBb243Z2NMbnVDQ2ZNTjRlS1hLSjJnVkJoZFRmMy1IVjFqd2F5aUVqdWZIQlJiSDllSFU1RXVGR0xWNzFmejJPMEt3enQzQmZ6RFhKamZqQmNsdDUtS0FobXptMjE4ZWR3</guid></item><item><title>根据神经科学家的说法， 7种日常习惯会让你悄无声息地变得不那么聪明- VegOut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxOUVFqaExBN2M4TjJJaHNYSzVKQVdweURvRG9ZUkd6RHdKc0R6enFvcV84emVLdUE0eXRIQnVGVXlUdzVPU0p0bzN6eGROMUZoa2tyQ3lrV1pZWWN3MTZ1Y2ptLXRGVHN4ZEg5TngyaWNNX0FRejBydWNFQkVnWF9tdDlzbXlIdlVFY0hmUjJKYi14UTF6aGM0OWEtMkNyQUpzLTJ4X2RjekVyXzVwZl9vMHFua1hwejFt?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="0" data-end="107"&gt;Crafting a sharp mind isn’t just about what you learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="0" data-end="107"&gt;It’s about what you do—every day—without thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="109" data-end="228"&gt;Here are seven daily habits that can quietly dull your thinking (and what to do instead), according to neuroscientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="230" data-end="261"&gt;1. Chronic sleep restriction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="263" data-end="336"&gt;Cutting sleep to “make time” is like siphoning fuel from your own engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="338" data-end="685"&gt;When you regularly sleep less than you need, attention, reaction time, and decision-making all take a hit—effects that stack up day after day. In a classic dose–response study, people limited to 6 hours a night for two weeks &lt;a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/uep/assets/user-content/documents/VanDongen_etal_Sleep_26_2_2003.pdf?.com"&gt;performed as poorly on vigilance tasks&lt;/a&gt; as those who went a full night without sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="338" data-end="685"&gt;Sleep also helps your brain file memories. During both slow-wave and REM sleep, the brain consolidates and reorganizes new information—think of it like saving work before your laptop dies. Skip good sleep and you don’t just feel foggy; you remember less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="338" data-end="685"&gt;As sleep scientist Matthew Walker puts it, “Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day.” I’ve learned the hard way that no hack beats a stable sleep window. Aim for a consistent 7–9 hours and a regular bedtime/waketime—even on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1309" data-end="1333"&gt;2. Media multitasking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1335" data-end="1443"&gt;I’ve mentioned this before, but your brain doesn’t truly multitask—it switches. And every switch has a cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1445" data-end="1759"&gt;Heavy media multitaskers tend to show poorer performance on tasks that require filtering distractions and maintaining focus. In one well-known study, people who juggled lots of media streams were &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.0903620106?.com"&gt;worse at ignoring irrelevant information&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting a hit to cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1445" data-end="1759"&gt;Neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley sums it up: our “brains &lt;a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262534437/the-distracted-mind/?.com"&gt;aren’t built for multitasking&lt;/a&gt;.” Translation: constant tab-hopping trains you to be distractible. Try batching similar tasks and using do-not-disturb blocks for 25–50 minutes. Your working memory will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1445" data-end="1759"&gt;Quick fix I use when I catch myself ping-ponging: write the one thing I’m doing on a sticky note and keep it in view until it’s done. Low-tech, high yield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2221" data-end="2241"&gt;3. Sedentary days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2243" data-end="2312"&gt;Long sits aren’t just hard on your back. They’re rough on your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2314" data-end="2677"&gt;Regular aerobic activity increases levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)—fertilizer for neurons—and is linked to better memory. In a randomized trial, a year of moderate walking increased hippocampal volume and &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1015950108?.com"&gt;improved spatial memory&lt;/a&gt; in older adults. Movement remodels the very structure that supports learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2679" data-end="2921"&gt;You don’t need to morph into a marathoner. Sprinkle in brisk 10-minute walks, take calls standing, and chase a light sweat most days. On photo days, I build in a loop around the block between edits; creativity reliably loosens up right after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2923" data-end="2953"&gt;4. Ultra-processed snacking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2955" data-end="3104"&gt;Ultra-processed foods—think packaged sweets, refined snacks, cured meats—are easy to reach for and easy to overdo. The problem isn’t just waistlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3106" data-end="3473"&gt;A large Brazilian cohort study found that higher intake of ultra-processed foods was associated with &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2799140?.com"&gt;faster cognitive decline over ~8 years&lt;/a&gt;, even after adjusting for total calories and other factors. Experimental work also links diets high in sugar and saturated fat with impairments in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3106" data-end="3473"&gt;You don’t have to be perfect. Just protect your “default” choices: fruit or nuts visible on the counter, a prepped grain-and-veg bowl in the fridge, and a rule I use on busy edit days—eat “ingredients” first, snacks second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3106" data-end="3473"&gt;Harvard’s summary of the evidence puts it bluntly: the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/eating-ultra-processed-foods-tied-to-cognitive-decline?.com"&gt;less ultra-processed&lt;/a&gt;, the better for your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3842" data-end="3859"&gt;5. Dehydration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3861" data-end="3923"&gt;Mild dehydration can feel like “meh.” It also dents cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3925" data-end="4191"&gt;Reviews show that even ~2% body-water loss can &lt;a href="https://europepmc.org/article/MED/22855911?.com"&gt;impair attention&lt;/a&gt;, executive function, and mood—even in healthy young adults. If your afternoon slump coincides with a dry mouth and a headache, it’s not just vibes; it’s physiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4193" data-end="4462"&gt;What helps me: front-load water in the morning, sip with each coffee (one mug of water per mug of caffeine), and set a refill cue tied to natural breaks (after meetings, after a walk, before driving). Add a pinch of salt or a squeeze of citrus if plain water bores you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4464" data-end="4484"&gt;6. Chronic stress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4486" data-end="4557"&gt;Short bursts of stress sharpen focus. Chronic stress does the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4559" data-end="4884"&gt;Persistent elevations in stress hormones like cortisol can impair the hippocampus (memory) and prefrontal cortex (planning, attention). Over time, that means slower recall, more mental errors, and a hair-trigger distractibility. The neuroscience is clear across animal and human studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4559" data-end="4884"&gt;This doesn’t mean “be calm” on command. It means build daily off-ramps—10 nasal breaths before opening your inbox, a 15-minute walk after lunch, or a boundary that your evening news scroll stops an hour before bed. I also keep a “rumination pad” on my desk; dumping looping thoughts onto paper frees up bandwidth to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5210" data-end="5231"&gt;7. Nightly alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5233" data-end="5335"&gt;A glass of wine can feel like it smooths the edges. But nightly drinking is not a brain-neutral habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5337" data-end="5673"&gt;A massive UK Biobank imaging analysis (36,000+ adults) found a dose-dependent association between alcohol intake and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28735-5.pdf?.com"&gt;reduced gray and white matter volume&lt;/a&gt;—even at light-to-moderate levels. The more frequent the intake, the more the brain changes. It’s correlational, but the pattern is consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5337" data-end="5673"&gt;If that sounds grim, here’s the move: pick your nights with intention and keep true off-days. I treat alcohol like dessert—occasional, deliberate, and not on autopilot. Your sleep (and next-day clarity) will likely improve immediately, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="0" data-end="19"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="21" data-end="110"&gt;You don’t need a brain implant to get smarter. You need fewer self-sabotaging defaults. Here’s a simple way to start: run a 14-day “clarity sprint.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="174" data-end="346"&gt;Pick one lever—sleep, focus, movement, food, water, stress, or alcohol. Define a tiny, boring rule for it. Think “lights out at 11 p.m.” not “fix my sleep forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="348" data-end="532"&gt;Decide the when, where, and how in advance. “When I close my laptop at 10:30, I set my phone to Do Not Disturb and plug it in across the room.” Clarity beats willpower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="534" data-end="778"&gt;Make your environment do the heavy lifting. Put the water bottle on your desk. Move snacks off the counter. Hide the distracting apps in a folder you never see. Reduce friction for the habit you want; add friction for the one you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="780" data-end="887"&gt;Track it with a single checkbox each day. No apps needed. Just a tiny streak on paper you can’t ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="889" data-end="1033"&gt;At the end of two weeks, do a quick debrief. What felt easier? What still felt sticky? Did your recall, mood, or focus shift even a notch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1035" data-end="1152"&gt;Keep what worked. Then layer a second lever while keeping the first on autopilot. Stacking beats overhauling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1154" data-end="1323"&gt;Give yourself the “don’t miss twice” rule. Miss a night, a walk, or a water refill? Fine. Aim to catch the next rep. Consistency grows from rebounds, not perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1325" data-end="1535"&gt;Use identity language to lock it in. “I’m the kind of person who protects sleep.” “I’m the kind of person who finishes one task before opening another tab.” Brains follow stories. Write ones you can live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1537" data-end="1811"&gt;Create if-then backups for real life. “If I feel the 3 p.m. slump, then I take a 5-minute walk and drink water before coffee.” “If I reach for a nightly drink out of habit, then I pour a sparkling water first and wait ten minutes. Default plans beat default impulses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1813" data-end="1913"&gt;Loop in one person you trust. Tell them your sprint goal. Public promises nudge private choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1915" data-end="2080"&gt;Traveling or slammed at work? Shrink the habit, don’t drop it. Five minutes of movement instead of thirty. One page read instead of ten. Keep the groove alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2082" data-end="2270"&gt;And remember why this matters. These aren’t moral choices; they’re bandwidth choices. Every good default you build buys you more clarity for the decisions that actually move your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2272" data-end="2429"&gt;Start tiny today. Protect one habit for two weeks. Then stack another. That’s how you quietly build a sharper mind—one small, repeatable win at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

In brief, thymi from 4–6-week-old mice were removed and connective tissue was removed. Stromal tissue was perforated using scissors and incubated with rotation in DMEM-F12 (Gibco) at room temperature for 10 min to liberate the thymocytes. The remaining stromal tissue was enzymatically digested (0.5 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Collagenase D (MilliporeSigma), 0.2 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; DNaseI (MilliporeSigma), 0.5 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Papain (Worthington Biochemical)). Cells were stained with anti-EpCAM antibodies conjugated to APC-Cy7 (clone G8.8, BioLegend, 3 µl per 100 million cells) and EpCAM&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were enriched by positive selection using magnetic anti-Cy7 beads (Miltenyi, 10 µl per 100 million cells). The enriched fraction was stained with the appropriate panel of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies to CD45 (clone 30-F11, Invitrogen, 1:100), Ly-51 (clone 6C3, BioLegend, 1:100), MHC-II I-A/I-E (clone M5/114.15.2, Invitrogen, 1:100), CD104 (clone 346-11A, BD Biosciences, 1:200), GP2 (clone 2F11-C3, MBL, 1:10), CD177 (clone 1171 A, R&amp;amp;D, 1:25), Ly-6D (clone 49-H4, Invitrogen, 1:200), Sca-1 (clone D7, BioLegend, 1:200), AIRE (clone 5H12, Invitrogen, 1:500), Ki-67 (clone SolA15, Invitrogen, 1:100), SynCAM (clone 3E1, MBL, 1:100), CD171/L1CAM (clone 555, Miltenyi, 1:25) along with fluorescein-labelled UEA-I (Vector Labs, 1:100), Zombie Aqua (BioLegend, 1:500) and DAPI (Invitrogen, 1:20). Intracellular staining for AIRE and Ki-67 was subsequently done using the eBioscience FoxP3 transcription factor staining kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Intracellular staining for MDM2 (clone EPR22256-98, Abcam, 1:25) was also done using the eBioscience FoxP3 transcription factor staining kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with the addition of a 1-h incubation in blocking buffer (eBioscience permeabilization buffer with 5% normal donkey serum) before a secondary stain (BV412 donkey anti-rabbit, Jackson Immuno, 1:50). Cells were sorted using FACS Symphony S6, FACSAria Fusion or FACSAria II equipped with a 100-μm nozzle (BD Biosciences). Flow-cytometry data for thymic mimetic cells were acquired using a Cytek Aurora. All other flow-cytometry data were acquired using a BD LSRII or Fortessa. All flow-cytometry data were analysed using FlowJo (v.10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;Human thymic tissue acquisition and processing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thymus fragments were obtained from a 12-week-old human patient with no known genetic abnormalities undergoing standard-of-care cardiac surgery. The patient was de-identified on receipt with written informed consent for the release of genomic sequence data in accordance with IRB protocol 20–1392 approved by the Biological Sciences Division and University of Chicago Medical Center Institutional Review Boards at the University of Chicago and protocol 2020-203 approved by the Advocate Aurora Health Research Subject Protection Program and Advocate Aurora Health Care Institutional Review Board. Connective tissue was removed and the remaining tissue was minced, then incubated with rotation in DMEM-F12 (Gibco) at 4 °C for 20 min to liberate the thymocytes. Stromal tissue was enzymatically digested using 0.5 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Collagenase D (MilliporeSigma) and 0.2 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; DNase I (MilliporeSigma) at 37 °C for 20 min. The remaining fragments were incubated with rotation in 0.5 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Papain (Worthington), 0.25 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Collagenase D and 0.1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; DNase I at 37 °C for 20 min. Cells were stained with anti-EpCAM antibodies conjugated to APC-Cy7 (clone 9C4, BioLegend, 1:100) and EpCAM&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were enriched by positive selection with magnetic anti-Cy7 beads (Miltenyi). The enriched fraction was stained with DAPI (Invitrogen, 1:20), CD45 (clone 2D1, BioLegend, 1:100), LY51/CD249 (clone 2D3/APA, BD Biosciences, 1:00) and HLA-DRA (clone L243, BioLegend, 1:100) and sorted on a Symphony S6 (BD Biosciences).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17"&gt;Flow cytometry of thymocytes and splenocytes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thymi from 4–6-week-old mice were removed and small cortical incisions were made before mechanical agitation with wide-bore glass pipettes in DMEM/F-12 (Gibco) to liberate the thymocytes. Spleens from mice aged 4 weeks to 12 months old were isolated in RPMI (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FCS. Cells were liberated by mincing with a syringe plunger and filtered through a 40-μm strainer. Following red blood cell lysis (BD PharmLyse), cells were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies specific for mouse CD4 (GK1.5, 1:100), CD8α (53-6.7, 1:100), CD25 (PC61, 1:100), CD44 (IM7, 1:100), CD69 (H1.2F3, 1:100), CD62L (MEL-14, 1:100), TCRβ (H57-597, 1:100) and DAPI (Invitrogen, 1:20). Intracellular staining for FoxP3 (clone FJK-16s, eBioscience, 1:100) was done using an eBioscience FoxP3 transcription factor staining kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Flow-cytometry data were acquired using a BD LSRII or Fortessa and analysed using FlowJo (v.10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18"&gt;Bulk RNA-seq sample preparation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We FACS-sorted 75,000 primary mTECs directly into RULT lysis buffer (Qiagen RNEasy UCP Micro Kit) and total RNA was extracted following the manufacturer’s instructions. The mRNA was enriched and RNA-seq libraries were constructed using an Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA kit. Paired-end, dual-index sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;Bulk RNA-seq data processing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA-seq reads were mapped to the mm10 mouse genome assembly using TopHat (v.2.1.1) with the setting –microexon-search. Unmapped, unpaired and low-quality reads (MAPQ ≤ 5) were removed using samtools (v.1.9) view with settings -q 5 -f 2. Paired reads were counted for each gene using featureCounts from Subread (v.2.0.1). TPM values were calculated for each gene to quantify the relative abundance of transcripts for clustering analysis. The trimmed mean of M values was calculated for each gene for differential comparisons across samples using edgeR (v.4.0.2) (calcNormFactors()). Common dispersions were estimated using estimateCommonDisp() and Benjamini–Hochberg FDRs were calculated for pairwise comparisons using the exactTest(). Genes with FDR ≤ 0.05 were regarded as significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec20"&gt;Definition of tissue-specific and AIRE-dependent genes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously published transcriptional data&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 64" title="Sansom, S.

In brief, 40,000 mTECs were FACS-sorted into 1× PBS supplemented with 2% BSA and centrifuged at 300&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min. Cells were gently washed in 50 μl lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in nuclease-free water) and centrifuged at 300&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min.

Transcript count matrices were used as inputs to the Seurat (v.5.1.0) gene expression analysis pipeline. For gene expression quality control, cells with nFeature_RNA ≥ 250 and ≤ 6,000, nCount_RNA ≤ 25,000 and percent_mitochondrial ≤ 25 were included for downstream analyses. Transcript counts were log-normalized. For scATAC-seq quality control, cells with n_ATAC_Frags ≥ 3,000 and TSS_Score ≥ 10 were included for downstream analyses. Doublet inference was conducted using ArchR addDoubletScores(), and presumed doublets were excluded. Cells that passed each filter were admitted for downstream analyses. Finally, based on gene expression markers, contaminating cells (thymocytes) and putative mTEC mimetic cells were excluded from analysis (except for targeted analyses of mimetic compartments). In the wild-type multiome (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09424-x#Fig1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;), a further cluster of cells that exhibited uncharacteristically low TSS enrichment scores was excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Multiome data processing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimensionality reduction, scATAC-seq clustering, projections, pseudotime, transcription factor motif enrichment (except for scATAC-seq fragments or genomic tiles, which was computed using HOMER2 (v.5.1) findMotifsGenome.pl with settings -size given), and transcription factor footprinting were performed using the ArchR pipeline with default parameters.

MAGIC-imputed values were used for UMAP display purposes only; imputed values were not used anywhere else in the analysis of scATAC-seq or scRNA-seq datasets (such as violin plots or heatmaps). For scATAC-seq peak calling, the standard &lt;i&gt;ArchR&lt;/i&gt; workflow was used using MACS2 (v.2.2.9.1). To maximize the detection of open chromatin regions specific to each sample and stage in the mTEC developmental trajectory, fixed-width 501-bp scATAC-seq peaks were called (extendSummits = 250) on the Tn5-corrected single base insertions (shift = −75, extsize = 150, –nomodel) for each scATAC-seq cluster identified per sample (groupBy = Clusters, reproducibility = 1) using the ArchR wrapper function addReproduciblePeakSet(). The significance of each called peak was calculated as a false discovery rate (&lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;-value) comparing the observed number of Tn5 insertions in the sliding window (300 bp) and the expected number of insertions (total number of insertions/genome size (–nolambda)). A &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;-value cutoff (cutOff = 0.1) and an upper limit for the number of peaks called per cell (peaksPerCell = 1,000, minCells = 100) were applied to prevent consideration of low-quality peaks. We also excluded peaks that mapped to the mitochondrial or Y chromosomes (excludeChr = c(chrM, chrY)). Peak sets called from each scATAC-seq cluster from respective samples were combined and trimmed for overlap using an iterative procedure that discarded any peak that directly overlapped with the most significant peak&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 66" title="Granja, J.

The resultant ‘union peak set’ was applied to all cells for WIP and OOP count-based and motif-based analyses. The fraction of fragments within peaks was computed automatically as a product of the addReproduciblePeakSet() function. Subnucleosomal and mononucleosomal fractions for each cell or sample were computed as the fraction of the cell’s scATAC-seq fragments whose length &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 100 bp (subnucleosomal) or 100 &amp;lt; &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 200 bp (mononucleosomal). To ensure reproducibility of bioinformatic analysis results, for each dataset, a single script was used for all the quality control and pre-processing, including purging of low-quality cells, doublet removal, peak calling, motif enrichment, dimensionality reduction and clustering. A file representing the full processed data was saved using saveArchRProject() and loaded for all subsequent analyses (this file was not edited after pre-processing). More individual scripts were used to load processed data and perform specific analyses or generate specific figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;Peak-centric differential accessibility analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differential chromatin accessibility analysis across peaks was done using ArchR getMarkerFeatures() with the following arguments: useMatrix = PeakMatrix, bias = c(TSSEnrichment, log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(number of scATAC-seq fragments)), testMethod = wilcoxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;Processing of OOP scATAC-seq fragments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each Multiome dataset, WIP and OOP fragments near genes of interest (such as αTSGs, housekeeping genes and maturation-induced genes) were retrieved using the ArchR and GenomicRanges R packages. For each gene: first, a search window, search_window, was established around the &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\rm{TSS}}({\rm{search}}\_{\rm{window}}={\rm{TSS}}\pm {\ell })\)&lt;/span&gt;; and second, scATAC-seq fragments intersecting the search_window were retrieved from cells of interest, cell_subset, using the ArchR getFragmentsFromProject() function with arguments subsetBy = search_window and cellNames = cell_subset. Fragments were then partitioned based on whether they overlapped the data’s union peak set using subsetByOverlaps() with arguments invert = FALSE to retrieve WIP fragments, or invert = TRUE to retrieve OOP fragments. Finally, fragments were binned and/or tallied for the specific application (see below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec26"&gt;Analyses comparing αTSG&lt;sup&gt;pos&lt;/sup&gt; and αTSG&lt;sup&gt;neg&lt;/sup&gt; mTECs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells from early mature, mid mature and late mature clusters expressing any αTSG&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 0 were selected as the αTSG&lt;sup&gt;pos&lt;/sup&gt; cohort and a size-matched cohort of αTSG&lt;sup&gt;neg&lt;/sup&gt; cells was sampled randomly from the remaining cells from the same three clusters. These cohorts were then used as inputs to getMarkerFeatures()in ArchR for differential accessibility of peaks between αTSG&lt;sup&gt;pos&lt;/sup&gt; and αTSG&lt;sup&gt;neg&lt;/sup&gt; mTECs. For local OOP and WIP analysis, ATAC-seq fragments within peaks and outside of peaks from αTSG&lt;sup&gt;pos&lt;/sup&gt; and αTSG&lt;sup&gt;neg&lt;/sup&gt; cohorts were intersected with a ±5 kb sliding window with 1 kb increments, normalized to the total number of ATAC-seq fragments per cell, and tallied in each window within a region flanking αTSG&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; . For αTSG coexpression analysis, the probability of detecting each αTSG&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;  neighbouring αTSG&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;  within the specified length scale (or a randomly selected alternative αTSG as a control) was computed for each of the αTSG&lt;sup&gt;pos&lt;/sup&gt; and αTSG&lt;sup&gt;neg&lt;/sup&gt; cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec27"&gt;Regression analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each αTSG&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, the total number of OOP and WIP scATAC-seq fragments within the characteristic window of instability &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(({\ell }=\pm 50\,{\rm{kb}})\)&lt;/span&gt; was computed for each mTEC in the early mature, mid mature and late mature clusters. A logistic regression framework was used (glm() with family = binomial) to estimate the probability of expressing a given αTSG based on the number of log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(OOP + 1) or log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(WIP + 1) fragments using log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(n_ATAC_Frags) per cell as a covariate. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-values for regression coefficients were generated using the Wald-&lt;i&gt;χ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; test (anova(test = ‘LR’)).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec28"&gt;CUT&amp;amp;RUN sample preparation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CUT&amp;amp;RUN was performed as previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 28" title="Skene, P.

In brief, 350,000–500,000 cells were washed 3 times in wash buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine, 1× EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) then bound to Concanavalin-A beads (Bangs Laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were incubated with 1:100 dilution of anti-p53 antibody (Leica NCL-L-p53-CM5p) for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C in permeabilization buffer (1× permeabilization buffer (eBioscience), 0.5 mM spermidine, 1× EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail, 2 mM EDTA).

Digestion was done in 0.5× permeabilization buffer supplemented with 2 mM CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 4 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2× stop buffer (final concentration 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 20 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; glycogen, 25 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; RNase A (Thermo Fisher)) and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Protein in the sample was then digested in 0.1% SDS and 250 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Proteinase K (New England Biolabs) for 2 h at 56 °C, shaking gently. CUT&amp;amp;RUN fragments were purified by phenol chloroform extraction.

PCR duplicates were removed using Picard (v.2.21.8) MarkDuplicates REMOVE_DUPLICATES=true VALIDATION_STRINGENCY = LENIENT. Reads with MAPQ scores below 30 were purged and excluded from downstream analysis using samtools (v.1.9) view -b -q 30 -f 2 -F 1804. Peaks were called for each sample using MACS2 (v.2.2.7.1) with settings --shift 0 --extsize 200 --nomodel --call-summits --keep-dup all -p 0.01. For each sample, a 301-bp fixed-width peak set was generated by extending the MACS2 summits by 150 bp in both directions. Peaks were ranked by significance (MACS2 peak score) and overlapping peaks with lower peak scores were removed iteratively to create non-overlapping sample peak sets. Peaks mapping to chrY, as well as any that spanned genomic regions containing “N” nucleotides, were removed. Robust peaks were defined by a score per million (SPM) (each peak score divided by the sum of all peak scores in the sample, divided by 1 million), and we retained only those peaks with SPM ≥ 5. We defined p53 CUT&amp;amp;RUN peaks by further filtering for peaks that overlapped with known p53-binding motifs (HOMER2, v5.1) from samples with characterized p53 activity (mTEC&lt;sup&gt;lo&lt;/sup&gt; samples).

In brief, tissues were fixed in buffered 10% formalin and paraffin-embedded. H&amp;amp;E staining was done by the standard methods. Histopathology scores were assigned using a four-tier system based on the degree and distribution of lymphocytic infiltration observed in the tissue sections. A score of 0 was assigned when no lymphocyte infiltration was detected; a score of 1 corresponded to minimal infiltration, characterized by very few small, isolated clusters; a score of 2 corresponded to moderate infiltration, in which several small to moderately sized clusters of lymphocytes were observed; a score of 3 corresponded to severe, diffuse infiltration, indicated by the presence of numerous large clusters distributed throughout the tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec32"&gt;Statistical analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;De novo and known transcription factor motif &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-values were determined using HOMER2 (v.5.1).

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, researchers took blood plasma samples from 841 participants diagnosed with Alzheimer's, mild cognitive impairments, and cognitively healthy controls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The samples were then examined for markers of brain inflammation and damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After analysing 700 individual lipids, scientists found that women with Alzheimer's had significantly more 'unhealthy' saturated lipids than women free from the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also noted that they had significantly less healthy lipids attached with omega fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Legido-Quigley added: 'Our study suggests that women should make sure they are getting omega fatty acids in their diet—through fatty fish or via supplements.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Dr Asger Wretlind, dementia expert from and study co-author from King's College London said: 'Although this still warrants further research, we were able to detect biological differences in lipids between the sexes in a large cohort, and show the importance of lipids containing omegas in the blood, which has not been done before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The results are very striking and now we are looking at how early in life this change occurs in women.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Figures show currently two in three people living with dementia in the UK are women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Around 900,000 Britons are currently thought to have the memory-robbing disorder. But University College London scientists estimate this will rise to 1.7 million within two decades as people live longer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists analysed lipids in the blood and found there was a significant difference in omega fatty acids between healthy women and Alzheimer's patients &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst experts say this could be a result of women living longer, or other risk factors such as social isolation, education or hormonal changes as a result of the menopause, the findings suggest that lifestyle changes could play a crucial role in the development of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Julia Dudley, head of research at Alzheimer's UK, said: 'While this study shows that women with Alzheimer's had lower levels of some unsaturated fats compared with men, further work is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This includes understanding the mechanisms behind this difference and finding out if lifestyle changes, including diet could have a role.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The charity, which is funding the work, is also calling for further research to focus on a more ethnically diverse population to see whether the same effect is seen across a wider sample size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dudley added: 'Understanding how the disease works differently in women could help doctors tailor future treatments and health advice.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent analysis by the Alzheimer's society estimates the overall annual cost of dementia to the UK is £42billion a year, with families bearing the brunt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An ageing population could see these costs soar to £90billion in the next 15 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 944,000 in the UK are thought to be living with dementia, while the figure is thought to be around 7million in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Memory problems, thinking and reasoning difficulties and language problems are common early symptoms of the condition, which then worsen over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's Research UK analysis found 74,261 people died from dementia in 2022 compared with 69,178 a year earlier, making it the country's biggest killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Cannabis smoke may also tug on deeper levers inside cells — the molecular switches that cancers use to grow and spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among these, few are as infamous as the epidermal growth factor receptor, or &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/lung-cancer/ive-never-seen-anything-like-this-scientists-hijack-cancer-genes-to-turn-tumors-against-themselves" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/lung-cancer/ive-never-seen-anything-like-this-scientists-hijack-cancer-genes-to-turn-tumors-against-themselves"&gt;&lt;u&gt;EGFR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

"In cannabis smokers, constant activation can fuel unchecked proliferation, speed genetic damage, and hasten the leap toward cancer — triggering earlier onset, faster spread, and treatment resistance." That said, Bhattacharyya's study included only 83 people with one type of cancer, so more work is needed to know if the results are broadly applicable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhattacharyya sees two priorities for future research. One is to develop realistic lab models — such as "&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/59675-body-parts-grown-in-lab.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/59675-body-parts-grown-in-lab.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;organoids&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;," 3D-printed tumors and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/58640-organ-on-chip-liver-fda.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/58640-organ-on-chip-liver-fda.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;organ chips&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — to study how cannabis amplifies EGFR. The other is to probe potentially dangerous additives that might be lurking in unregulated cannabis products, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fc71fdfe-63bc-44e8-b953-4d5c53f99236"&gt;For all the unsettling biology uncovered in laboratory studies, real-world studies of cannabis smokers tell a mixed story. Some research links heavy cannabis use to higher cancer risk, while others find &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425761/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425761/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;no clear connection&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Still, Cuomo maintains that long-term use of the drug may increase the odds of developing cancer, based on what we know so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people who already have cancer, however, Cuomo has shown that cannabis use isn't linked to an earlier death — a puzzle researchers now call "&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medschool.ucsd.edu/about/news/archive/2025/08-04-cuomo-paradox.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://medschool.ucsd.edu/about/news/archive/2025/08-04-cuomo-paradox.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cuomo's paradox&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;."

Participants who have withdrawn (153 as of 15 September 2023) were excluded from the analysis. Chronic pain was defined by considering a screening question asking whether participants are “troubled by pain or discomfort present for more than 3 months” (item f120019). The question “area most bothered by pain in the last three months” (item f120037) was used to define the location of most bothersome pain and the intensity of the most bothersome pain was defined from items 120023–120035 asking for the “rating of pain” in the most bothersome pain location. People with no chronic pain had their intensity values imputed to 0. People who self-reported fibromyalgia (f120009), chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic-encephalomyelitis (f120010) or chronic pain all over the body (f120021) were excluded from the analysis (11,951 with chronic pain and 821 with no chronic pain). We had valid most bothersome pain ratings for 139,167 (71,904 and 67,263 meeting criteria for no chronic pain and chronic pain, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec12"&gt;Genotyping, imputation and quality control&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we used genotype datasets from the UKB to investigate genetic factors related to chronic pain. We used two specific releases: version 2 for directly genotyped variants and version 3 for imputed genotypes. Initially, approximately 50,000 UKB participants were genotyped using the Applied Biosystems UK BiLEVE Axiom Array by Affymetrix. Subsequently, around 440,000 participants were genotyped using the Applied Biosystems UKB Axiom Array.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quality-control and imputation procedures were performed as detailed previously&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 45" title="Bycroft, C. et al.

This dataset was subjected to further quality control before phasing and imputation were performed using a combined Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) and UK10K reference panel. The imputed dataset has over 90 million autosomal SNVs, short indels and large structural variants for 487,442 individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess genetic ancestry, we used the KING software (v.2.3.2)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 46" title="Manichaikul, A. et al.

The directly genotyped dataset was used with additional quality control filters using PLINK (v.1.90b6.21, &lt;a href="https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/"&gt;https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 47" title="Chang, C.

This analysis enabled us to identify five distinct subpopulations within the UKB: African (9,059 samples), admixed American (605 samples), East Asian (2,572 samples), European (464,586 samples) and South Asian (9,604 samples). Moreover, there were 1,951 samples for which the ancestry could not be determined and the ancestries were therefore categorized as missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genotyping data, encompassing both directly genotyped and imputed variants, and excluding individuals who had withdrawn their consent from the UKB study were available for 487,071 samples. Additional quality-control measures were applied that further excluded 367 samples where the reported sex did not match the inferred sex from their genetic data, 651 samples with suspected sex chromosome aneuploidy and 188 samples with more than ten putative third-degree relatives. In total, 1,024 samples were excluded, with some samples falling into multiple exclusion categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samples of European ancestry were selected, resulting in 462,402 samples available for analyses. The imputed dataset (chromosomes 1–22) was restricted to common and low-frequency variants (minor allele frequency ≥ 1%) that were imputed with high confidence (imputation accuracy info score ≥ 0.8) leaving 9,572,556 variants in the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec13"&gt;Association analyses and candidate SNV identification&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted association analyses using REGENIE (v.3.4.1)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 48" title="Mbatchou, J. et al.

REGENIE uses a two-step whole-genome regression method that effectively accounts for population stratification and sample relatedness. For the continuous outcome, we applied rank-based inverse normal transformation to improve the distribution and meet the assumptions of the regression model. The model included the following covariates: age at the time of completing the questionnaire, sex, genotyping array and the top ten principal components provided by the UKB. REGENIE step 1 was run on a set of the directly genotyped variants, filtered using PLINK2 (v.2.00a5; &lt;a href="https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/"&gt;https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 47" title="Chang, C.

This analysis involved generating pheWAS plots from a comprehensive dataset comprising 4,756 GWAS summary statistics, acquired from the GWAS ATLAS. We incorporated all relevant GWAS and associated genes into our selection criteria. For the pheWAS SNV plots, SNVs were deemed to be significant with &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values of less than 0.05 and applied the Bonferroni correction method to adjust for multiple comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Gene-based tests, pathway exploration and enrichment analyses&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our study, we used the FUMA software for gene-based tests, pathway exploration and enrichment analyses. FUMA leverages GWAS summary statistics to prioritize genes, assess gene expression and enrich pathway processes. To address the issue of multiple testing, FUMA applied the Bonferroni correction with a threshold of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;bon&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05. Moreover, FUMA incorporates multimarker analysis of genomic annotation (MAGMA) for both gene-based and gene-set analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;Ethics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data for this study were obtained from the UKB for project “Risk factors for chronic pain”, application ID: 49572.

HEK293F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific), which tested negative for mycoplasma, were cultured in FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37 °C under 8% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 24 h before transfection, were passaged to 0.7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells per ml to give a density of 1.3–1.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells per ml after transfection. Transfection was carried out with 1.1 mg plasmid and 2.2 mg linear polyethyleneimine (PEI) MAX (Mw 40,000; Polysciences) per l culture. After transfection, sodium butyrate was added to 10 mM to increase protein expression. Cells were collected 40 h after transfection. Membranes were prepared by lysing the cells by sonication and unbroken cells and cell debris were pelleted at 10,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min at 4 °C and membranes were collected through centrifugation at 200,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 1 h and washed once with 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 20 mM KCl. After washing, the membranes were resuspended in PBS and snap-frozen for storage at −80 °C until required. For purification, thawed membranes were solubilized in buffer containing 1× PBS pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol and 2% (w/v) &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-dodecyl-β-&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-maltopyranoside (DDM, Anatrace) with 0.4% (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) for nanodisc reconstitution or 1% lauryl maltoside neopentyl glycol with (LMNG, Anatrace) 0.1% (w/v) CHS for 90 min at 4 °C under gentle agitation using a magnetic stir plate. Insoluble material was removed through centrifugation for 1 h at 200,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. SLC45A4 was purified to homogeneity using standard immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography protocols in either DDM:CHS (5:1 ratio) or LMNG:CHS (10:1 ratio). In brief, 4 ml of nickel NTA resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added with 25 mM imidazole (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 h at 4 °C under gentle agitation using a magnetic stir plate. The resin was loaded onto a gravity flow column (Bio-Rad) and washed with ten column volumes (CVs) of buffer containing either 0.15% DDM:CHS (5:1 ratio) or 0.15% LMNG:CHS (5:1 ratio) and 25 mM imidazole, followed by 20 CVs of buffer with 30 mM imidazole and 300 mM NaCl. The protein was eluted in four CVs of buffer containing 250 mM imidazole and dialysed overnight with TEV protease (1:0.5 M ratio) against 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl with 0.03% DDM:CHS (5:1 ratio) or 0.003% LMNG:CHS (10:1 ratio) at 4 °C under gentle agitation using a magnetic stir plate. After TEV cleavage, the protease and cleaved His-tagged GFP were removed through nickel affinity chromatography on a 1 ml HisTrap column (Sigma-Aldrich). Unbound material was then concentrated to 500 μl using a 50 kDa molecular-weight cut-off spin concentrator (Sartorius) at 4 °C and subjected to size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200) in the same buffer as above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;Cell-based &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C-SPD transport assays&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transport activity of overexpressed SLC45A4 was assayed in Neuro-2A cells (ATCC CCL-131), which tested negative for mycoplasma, using &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C-radiolabelled SPD (American Radiolabeled Chemical, ARC3138, 100 mCi mmol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Cells were maintained in Gibco DMEM (high glucose, GlutaMAX Supplement, pyruvate, 31966021) at 37 °C under 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. For transport assays, 1.0–1.7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cells were seeded per well in 12-well plates and transfected 48–52 h later (once confluency had reached about 60–80%) using FuGENE HD (Promega, E2311) transfection reagent, with 1 µg plasmid (WT &lt;i&gt;SLC45A4&lt;/i&gt; or mutants in pLexM, with a C-terminal Flag tag) and 2.5 µl FuGENE per well. Fresh medium was placed onto the cells 12–15 h thereafter and assays were carried out 40–46 h after transfection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before measuring transport activity, cells were washed twice in assay buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 135 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 28 mM glucose) and incubated for 3 min at 37 °C after the second wash. Immediately after the incubation, 240 µl of the assay buffer supplemented with 1 µM &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C-SPD and 9 µM cold SPD was pipetted onto the cells and incubated for 1.5, 5 and 10 min (time-course assays) or 8 min (single-timepoint assays for mutants) at 37 °C. Uptake was then quenched by washing cells twice in 500 µl ice-cold assay buffer and the cells were lysed in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.2% Triton X-100. The amount of transported &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C-SPD was measured by scintillation counting in Ultima Gold scintillation liquid (PerkinElmer), and the amount of transported SPD was calculated using a standard curve for the substrate using the specific activity of the SPD. For competition assays and IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; measurements, only 1 µM of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C-SPD was used in the substrate mixture along with the desired concentration of the competing compound. Experiments were performed at least six times to generate an overall mean and s.d. Owing to variability and high background in the assay, originating from endogenous SLC45A4 and possibly to some extent endocytosis/binding to plasma membrane proteins, each experiment was performed with both WT (cells that were transfected with a plasmid containing WT &lt;i&gt;SLC45A4&lt;/i&gt;) and cells transfected with an empty plasmid. If the WT uptake did not exceed 2.5-fold that of the empty plasmid control, the results from that plate were discarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expression of WT &lt;i&gt;SLC45A4&lt;/i&gt; and mutants were assessed using western blotting on membrane fractions with an anti-Flag antibody (Merck, F1804) at 5,000× dilution, using an anti-β-actin antibody as a loading control at 10,000× dilution (Merck, A2228) (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09326-y#Fig6"&gt;1f&lt;/a&gt;). Plasma membrane localization was measured using immunofluorescence (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09326-y#Fig6"&gt;1h&lt;/a&gt;). Cells were seeded on glass coverslips, transfected as described above with Flag-tagged SLC45A4 and 36 h after transfection, cells were washed in PBS pH 7.4 and fixed in 4% PFA for 7 min. After quenching in 50 mM ammonium chloride and further washing, the cells were permeabilized in 100 µM digitonin and the coverslips blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min. Cells were stained with mouse anti-Flag (1:200 dilution) and rabbit anti-Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase (1:50 dilution) primary antibodies for 1 h, washed and further stained with goat anti-mouse IgG AF488 (1:200) and anti-rabbit IgG AF647 (1:200) secondary antibody–fluorophore conjugates for imaging.

The sample was adsorbed to glow-discharged holey carbon-coated grids (Quantifoil 300 mesh, Au R1.2/1.3) for 10 s. The grids were then blotted for 2 s at 100% humidity at 10 °C and frozen in liquid ethane using the Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Data were collected in counting mode in electron event representation (EER) format on the CFEG-equipped Titan Krios G4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) system operating at 300 kV with a Selectris X imaging filter (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with slit width of 10 eV at ×165,000 magnification on a Falcon 4i direct detection camera (Thermo Fisher Scientific) corresponding to a calibrated pixel size of 0.732 Å.

In brief, particles were subjected to two rounds of reference-free 2D classification (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; = 300 each) using a 140 Å soft circular mask within cryoSPARC. Four volumes were generated from a 479,080 particle subset of the 2D-cleaned particles after multiclass ab initio reconstruction using a maximum resolution cut-off of 6 Å. Particles from the most populated and structured class were selected, and another multiclass ab initio reconstruction (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; = 4) was performed. Output volumes were lowpass-filtered to 7 Å and used as references for a four-class heterogeneous refinement against the full 2D-cleaned particle set (2,815,141 particles). Particles (964,648) from the most populated and structured class were selected and non-uniform refined against their corresponding volume lowpass-filtered to 15 Å, generating a 3.3 Å map. A multiclass ab initio reconstruction (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; = 4) using a maximum-resolution cut-off of 6 Å was performed on these particles, generating four volumes that were lowpass-filtered to 7 Å and used as references for heterogeneous refinement against the same particle set. Particles (700,436) belonging to the two most populated and structured volumes (which were in opposite hands) were combined and subjected to non-uniform refinement against one of the corresponding volumes, lowpass-filtered to 15 Å, generating a 3.3 Å map with slightly improved density over the previously refined volume. Bayesian polishing followed by non-uniform refinement (15 Å lowpass-filtered reference) further improved the map quality to 3.0 Å. Per-particle defocus refinement followed by non-uniform refinement (15 Å lowpass-filtered reference) resulted in a 2.8 Å map that was used for model building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the SLC45A4 nanodisc structure (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09326-y#Fig8"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;), the 20,196,090 extracted particles (box size of 240 px) were subjected to three rounds of conservative 2D classification to give 1,473,487 particles, which were further classified into four classes in ab initio reconstruction. Three rounds of less conservative 2D classification of the initial particle set gave 5,812,766 particles, which were classified by two rounds of heterogeneous refinement, using the best ab initio map from the earlier reconstruction. After further sorting particles using ab initio reconstruction, Bayesian polishing was performed and particles were re-extracted with a box size of 320 px.

In brief, CRISPR–Cas9 technology was used to delete exons 3–8 of the mouse &lt;i&gt;Slc45a4&lt;/i&gt; gene on chromosome 15. This 13.3 kb deletion accounts for 89.64% of the &lt;i&gt;Slc45a4&lt;/i&gt; coding region. Guide RNAs were designed to target only the &lt;i&gt;Slc45a4&lt;/i&gt; locus and injected together with Cas9 into mouse zygotes. Chimeric F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; offspring mice were bred with WT mice to generate heterozygous founders F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; which were screened for successful &lt;i&gt;Slc45a4&lt;/i&gt; editing. The targeted region of &lt;i&gt;Slc45a4&lt;/i&gt; was sequenced to confirm deletion of exons 3–8.

DRG, EDL muscle and skin tissue was collected and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 1–2 h, and spinal cord for 24 h. DRG, skin and spinal cord were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose and stored for at least 48 h before embedding in OCT. DRG tissue was cryosectioned at 12 μm, skin at 30 µm and spinal cord at 20 µm. Fixed EDL muscle was teased into small fibre bundles of about 1 mm diameter per bundle. For histology on neural cultures, live CellTracker dye CMTMR was added along with IB4-conjugated AF488, or cells were washed and fixed in 4% PFA for 15 min room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec28"&gt;IHC&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standard immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques were used. Antigen retrieval in a citric acid buffer was performed on skin sections before IHC (citrate buffer, sodium citrate dihydrate, EDTA, distilled H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, pH 6.1, 65 °C, 1 h). In brief, the sectioned or teased samples were washed in PBS and blocked in a blocking solution (5% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100, PBS) for at least 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09326-y#MOESM1"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;) were diluted in the same blocking solution and were left to incubate on the tissue samples overnight at room temperature or 4 °C. The samples were washed in a washing buffer solution (0.3% Triton X-100, PBS). Secondary antibodies (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09326-y#MOESM1"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;) were diluted in the washing buffer solution and left to incubate on the tissue for 1–2 h at room temperature in dark conditions. The samples were washed thoroughly in the washing buffer, DRG and skin sections were mounted using Vectorshield (with or without DAPI) and muscle fibres were mounted onto microscope slides (Avantor, 631-0108) using hard-set confocal matrix (Micro Tech Lab). Images were taken on confocal microscopes (Zeiss LSM-710, LSM-780 or Olympus FV3000).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec29"&gt;ISH analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In situ hybridization (ISH) was performed according to the user instructions for the RNAscope 2.5 RED Chromogenic assay kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Bio-techne). In brief, fixed DRG tissue underwent pretreatment with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, protease III and 100% ethanol. The tissue was then incubated at 2 h at 40 °C with an &lt;i&gt;Slc45a4&lt;/i&gt; mRNA probe (522131). Probe amplification, washing steps and chromogenic development with fast red were carried out as described in the user kit. The tissue was then co-stained and imaged using the IHC protocol described above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec30"&gt;Image analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;All image analysis was performed using ImageJ/Fuji (NIH). For IHC, at least, three sections per animal were used from three animals per group. Total cells and cells positive for each subpopulation marker were counted using the multipoint tool. For ISH, cells were defined and mRNA intensity calculated. The background intensity was calculated with tissue that underwent the ISH protocol with a standard negative control mRNA probe. A threshold for positive cells was defined as cells whose average intensity was more than mean + 3 s.d. of background intensity. Cell size classification was as follows: cell area &amp;lt; 490μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; was classified as a small cell, cell area between 490–962 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; was classified as a medium cell and a large cell had an area greater than 962 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. For intraepidermal nerve fibre density analysis, nerve fibres crossing into the epidermis were counted live under the ocular lens of the Zeiss LSM-710 system. The distance of each section was calculated post hoc in Fuji and nerve fibres were quantified as fibres per mm. Spinal neurons were first segmented using Cellpose 2.0. Within Cellpose 2.0, we used a human-in-the-loop pipeline to train a custom model by annotating cells on the Cellpose graphical user interface. Cells were determined to be positive for target probe mRNA if signal intensity was 3 s.d. above the negative control readings. Superficial lamina (I + II) were defined by IB4 staining to mark lamina II. A reference template (Atlas of the Mouse Spinal Cord) was used analyse all other laminae. For assessment of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) size, fragmentation, area and nerve terminal registration, optimized settings for each image were used. Between three and five &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; stacks were obtained per muscle sample. Ten NMJs were analysed from each animal using ImageJ software. The ImageJ macro (BetterAreaGreyValues) was used to measure NMJ area and fragmentation (&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09326-y#MOESM1"&gt;Supplementary Methods&lt;/a&gt;). Registration of different fluorescence signals was analysed using the JACoP plugin for ImageJ. All comparative image analysis was conducted with the experimenter blinded to genotype.

Tissues were rapidly dissected and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. RNA was isolated from fresh-frozen mouse tissues using a combination of TriPure (Roche) and a RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). In brief, tissue was homogenized in Tripure using a handheld homogenizer (Cole-Parmer), treated with chloroform and then column-purified and eluted in RNase-free water. Genomic DNA was removed with on-column DNase I digestion. cDNA synthesis was performed using the EvoScript Universal cDNA Master kit (Roche). Gene expression was quantified by detecting amplified material using the LightCycler SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche) on the LightCycler 480 II system (Roche). Three technical replicates were included for each sample. The results were normalized to three reference gene controls (mouse &lt;i&gt;Actb&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gapdh&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Hprt&lt;/i&gt;) using the ∆∆&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; method.

Spermine tetrahydrochloride and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) with 1% of chlorotrimethylsilane (TMCS) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Deuterated polyamine standards: putrescine-D8 (PUTD8), spermidine-D8 (SPDD8) and spermine-D8 (SPMD8) were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories through CK Isotopes. GABA was obtained from MP Biomedicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec36"&gt;Sample collection and preparation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mouse tissues used for extraction were as follows. For brain tissue, half a hemisphere was used (average 230 mg). DRGs were dissected and collected across all regions (cervical to lumbar), with an average of 8 mg. Blood was collected during perfusion and plasma separated after centrifugation at 1,300 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. Spinal columns were removed and kept on HBSS. Each spinal column was transferred to a silicon-coated Petri dish containing HBSS and fixed in place with the dorsal side facing up using four needles. The whole spinal cord was collected (~51 mg) after exposure and removal of the overlying tissue, vertebrae and meninges. To delineate dorsal versus ventral horn, the dorsal fourth of the spinal cord (average 22 mg) was collected, and the remaining tissue was collected as ventral (average 31 mg).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polyamines and GABA were extracted as previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 68" title="Yu, Z. et al.

All tissues were suspended in 800 μl of lysis buffer (80% methanol diluted in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O with 2% TFA). For plasma, 100 μl was diluted in 400 μl of 100% methanol with 2% TFA. For polyamine analysis, the samples were spiked with 5 μl of 1 mM deuterated polyamine samples and 10 μl of each polyamine standard (10 mM solution, 10 nmol per sample). For GABA analysis, 2-amino-3-(2-chlorophenyl)propanoic acid was used as an internal standard (10 mM solution, 20 nmol per sample). The suspensions were homogenized in a bead beater (Precellys 24, Bertin Technologies) for three cycles (6,500 rpm, 45 s) (5 cycles for DRG tissues) with 3 min incubation on dry ice between cycles. The samples were left on dry ice for 1 h and then centrifuged at 17,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and transferred into a glass vial to dry under vacuum (SpeedVac) overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec37"&gt;Chemical derivatization&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For GABA analysis, the dried samples were resuspended in a mixture of 50 μl MSTFA with 5% TMCS and 50 μl pyridine, followed by incubation for 1 h at 60 °C at a shaking speed of 1,200 rpm. The samples were cooled down to ambient temperature, centrifuged at 8,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 30 min at 4 °C and injected directly for two-dimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC×GC–MS) analysis (described below) with splits of 1/20 or 1/100, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For polyamine analysis, the dried samples were resuspended in 300 μl trifluoracetic anhydride. The vials were then sealed and incubated for 1 h at 60 °C. The samples were left to dry at ambient temperature for an hour and then evaporated to dryness under vacuum (SpeedVac). Derivatized samples were resuspended in 50 μl of 100% acetonitrile and vortexed until any solid was adequately mixed. Finally, the samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 8,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; at 4 °C and injected for GC×GC–MS analysis (described below) with splits of 1/2 or 1/10, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec38"&gt;GC&lt;i&gt;×&lt;/i&gt;GC–MS analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The samples were immediately analysed using a GC×GC–MS system comprising a gas chromatograph coupled to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Shimadzu GCMS QP2010 Ultra) and a Shimadzu AOC-20i/s auto sampler. The first-dimension separation was carried out on a SHM5MS capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.25 μm film thickness, Shimadzu) while the second-dimension separation was on a BPX-50 capillary column (5 m, 0.15 mm inner diameter, 0.15 μm film thickness, SGE). Helium gas was used as a carrier gas at a 73 psi constant inlet head pressure. The modulation period was set as 4 s. The samples (1 μl) were injected at 280 °C. For GABA analysis, the oven temperature was programmed from 60 °C to 240 °C at 10 °C min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and then to 320 °C at 40 °C min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, held at 320 °C for 6 min. For polyamine analysis, the oven temperature was programmed from 60 °C to 320 °C at 10 °C min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and held at 320 °C for 8 min. The interface temperature to the mass spectrometer was set at 300 °C and ion source was heated at 230 °C. The MS was operated at scan speeds of 20,000 amu, covering &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; 45–600. Electron ionization spectra were recorded at 70 eV. The standard curves were generated using mixtures of deuterated polyamines (10 nmol) and different ratios of endogenous polyamines. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS pH 7.4) was used as the matrix to do the standard curves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec39"&gt;Data processing and analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raw GC×GC MS data were processed using GCMSsolution software (v.2.72/4.50 Shimadzu) and Chromsquare software (v.2.1.6, Shimadzu) in combination with the NIST 11/s, OA_TMS, FA_ME and YUTDI in-house libraries that were used for data analysis. The annotation of metabolites was carried out by comparing them to the standards (IM spectra and retention times). The confidence of identification was further validated by manual inspection of matches between experimentally observed and standard EI spectra.

The lumbar spinal column was removed and immersed in ice-cold sACSF and the spinal cord was quickly obtained by laminectomy. Parasagittal slices (300 μm) were cut on a vibratome (Leica VT 1200) in ice-cold sACSF. Slices were then transferred to a submerged chamber containing oxygenated NMDG-based recovery ACSF (rACSF) for 15 min at 34 °C, containing 93 mM NMDG, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 30 mM NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 20 mM HEPES, 25 mM glucose, 5 mM Na-ascorbate, 2 mM thiourea, 3 mM Na-pyruvate, 10 mM MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and 0.5 mM CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and adjusted to pH 7.4 with HCl. After recovery incubation, slices were maintained in oxygenated at room temperature until recording. ACSF was composed of 126 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 2 mM CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1.25 mM NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 26 mM NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and 10 mM glucose. Lamina II neurons were visually identified in an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with infrared differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) and a ×40 water-immersion-objective. Patch pipettes (4–6 MΩ) were filled with 140 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM MgATPg, 0.4 mM NaGTP, 0.1% Lucifer-Yellow (LY, Sigma-Aldrich), pH 7.3 adjusted with KOH. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were obtained using a Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices), digitized with a Digidata 1440 (Molecular Devices), and recorded using pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices). Data were filtered at 5 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurons were recorded in current clamp to obtain measures of resting membrane potential (RMP), input resistance and rheobase. Thereafter, tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1 μM) and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione disodium salt (CNQX; 10 μM) were superfused onto slices to record miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Neurons were maintained at −70 mV (liquid junction potential = 5 mV). Only neurons with a resting potential more negative than −40 mV and stable access resistance (&amp;lt;25 MΩ) during the recording were included for subsequent analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec41"&gt;Whole-cell patch-clamp&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four independent patch-clamp experiments were conducted using 4 (2 male, 2 female) WT and 4 (2 male, 2 female) &lt;i&gt;Slc45a4-&lt;/i&gt;KO mice. Before patch-clamp, an IB4-conjugated AF488 live dye was added to the cells for 30 min at 37 °C to distinguish IB4-binding/positive and IB4-non binding/negative neurons. Using this, we defined small (diameter &amp;lt; 25 µm) IB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons as predominantly non-peptidergic nociceptors and small IB4&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; neurons as predominantly peptidergic nociceptors. This definition is not clear cut—there will be some overlap and some cells that are negative for both markers (that is, C-LTMRs and CYSLTR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; nociceptors&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 70" title="Qi, L. et al.

To confirm that the majority of IB4&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; neurons are peptidergic nociceptors, we carried out an independent experiment and cultured &lt;i&gt;Cgrp&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;creERT2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;-tdTomato&lt;/i&gt; sensory neurons and live imaged them with IB4–AF488 and a blue live-cell dye. We counted 933 small-sized neurons. In total, 459 small cells bound to IB4–AF488, and 140 small cells (15%) were negative for both tdTomato and IB4–AF488. We determined that of the small neurons that were IB4&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, 70% were tdTomato&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, confirming our assumption that the majority of small-sized IB4&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; neurons are peptidergic nociceptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiments using the Axopatch 200B amplifier and Digidata 1550 acquisition system (Molecular Devices) were performed at room temperature. Data were sampled at 20 kHz and low-pass filtered at 5 kHz. Series resistance was compensated 80 to 85% to reduce voltage errors. AF488&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons were detected with an Olympus microscope with an inbuilt GFP filter set (470/40× excitation filter, dichroic LP 495 mirror, and 525/50 emission filter). Filamental borosilicate glass capillaries (1.5 mm outer diameter, 0.84 mm inner diameter; World Precision Instruments) were pulled to form patch pipettes of 2 to 5 MΩ tip resistance and filled with an internal solution containing 100 mM K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; gluconate, 28 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 5 mM MgATP, 10 mM HEPES and 0.5 mM EGTA; the pH was adjusted to 7.3 with KOH and the osmolarity was set at 305 mOsm (using glucose). Neurons were maintained in a chamber constantly perfused with a standard extracellular solution containing 140 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1.2 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 10 mM HEPES and 10 mM glucose; the pH was adjusted to 7.3 with NaOH and the osmolarity was set at 315 mOsm (using glucose). There was a calculated −13 mV junction potential when using these solutions; voltage values were adjusted to compensate for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RMP was measured in bridge mode (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; = 0). In current-clamp mode, neurons were held at −60 mV. The input resistance was derived by measuring the change in membrane voltage caused by a 80 pA hyperpolarizing current step. Rheobase was determined by applying 50 ms depolarizing current steps, (Δ10 pA), until action potential generation. Suprathreshold activity/repetitive firing was assed using two protocols. First, 500 ms depolarizing current steps (Δ50 pA) were used until a final step current of 950 pA. Second, we used a ramp protocol that gradually injects current from 0 to 1 nA, with the duration of the ramp increasing (Δ100 ms) each time until a final ramp stimulus of 1,000 ms. All data were collected using pClamp10 and analysed by Clampfit 10 software (Molecular Devices).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec42"&gt;Ex vivo skin-nerve preparation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hind paw glabrous skin and tibial nerve were dissected from adult WT (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8, 5 male and 3 female) and &lt;i&gt;Slc45a4&lt;/i&gt;-KO (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8, 6 male, 2 female) mice. The skin was maintained in a perfusion chamber in the outside out configuration (epidermis facing up). The chamber was perfused with carbogen bubbled synthetic interstitial fluid (SIF: 2.0 mM CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 5.5 mM glucose, 3.5 mM KCL, 26.2 mM NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3,&lt;/sub&gt; 0.7 mM MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 108 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 9.5 mM Na-gluconate, 7.5 mM sucrose) at 32 °C. The tibial nerve was isolated using mineral oil (Sigma-Aldrich) in an adjacent chamber, desheathed and the nerve fibres were teased apart and placed onto a silver recording electrode. Single-fibre receptive fields were located using a blunt probe and conduction velocity was measured (C-fibre, &amp;lt;1.2 m s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; Aδ-fibre, 1.2–10 m s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; Aβ-fibre, ≥10 m s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) using pulsed suprathreshold electrical currents. Receptive fields were stimulated mechanically using a 0.8 mm diameter flat probe attached to a piezo electric stimulator (Physik Instrument) or a NanoMotor stimulator (Kleindiek), both in conjunction with force sensors (Kleindiek). Stimuli were as follows: consistent force with subsequent stimuli increasing in velocity; 20 Hz vibration with a steadily increasing force; and 7 s step-increasing forces were applied to characterize mechanical thresholds and stimulus–response profiles. Thermal responses were achieved by using a receptive field isolator (ring-isolator) containing an internal thermistor (Warner instruments), and placed on top of an identified receptive field. Then, 1 ml of 65 °C buffer was pipetted into the ring isolator (starting at 32 °C), creating a consistent temperature ramp from 32 to 50 °C in 1.21 s (±0.055). All stimuli evoked action potentials/spikes were recorded using a Powerlab v.4.0 system in conjunction with LabChart v8 software (ADInstruments).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec43"&gt;Animal behaviour&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 15 (8 male, 7 female) WT mice, 14 (7 male, 7 female) heterozygous mice and 7 (3 male, 4 female) homozygous KO mice were used for behavioural studies. All mice were littermates, and age and sex matched where possible. All mice included in the behavioural pipelines underwent all behavioural tests. Mice were tested at a consistent time of day during the light phase, in the same environment by the same experimenter. Mice were habituated to their testing environments and equipment before testing days. The experimenter was blinded to animal genotype until post-behavioural analysis was complete. Mice were randomly assigned a test environment and test order, which was achieved by random selection from their home cages. Unless otherwise stated, each test was conducted three times on different days to obtain an average baseline score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec44"&gt;Open field&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each mouse was individually placed into an open black testing box (size) with a grid marked into the floor. Mice were allowed to freely explore the open field for 3 min while being video recorded and tracked using ANY maze software. The following parameters were measured: the number of rears, number of gridline crossing, total distance travelled and maximum speed when travelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec45"&gt;Rotarod&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were placed onto a speed-controlled horizontal rod/beam (Ugo Basile). Once mice were placed onto the stationary rod, an increasing speed (ramp) protocol was applied (0.5 rpm s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for 20 s, 0.25 rpm s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for 160 s, 0.16 rpm s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for 120 s to reach a final speed of 80 rpm). Mice were monitored until they fell from the rotating rod. Latency to fall (s) and final speed (rpm) was recorded on two testing days and averaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec46"&gt;Mechanical testing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were placed into a testing box (5 × 5 × 10 cm) elevated on a wire mesh base and the mice allowed to acclimatize for 30–60 min.

The mice were observed and timed until their hind paws reacted to the hot plate (lifting, flicking, licking, cut off set to 20 s). The latency to respond to each hot plate was measured. For the Hargreaves test, the mice were placed into a test box (5 × 5 × 10 cm) on elevated glass and acclimatized for 30–60 min. The Hargreaves radiant heat source was applied to each paw three times and latency to withdraw was recorded. Noxious cold sensitivity was measured using the dry ice test. Mice were placed in test boxes, and elevated on a 5 mm thick glass platform. Dry-ice pieces were placed into a 2 ml syringe (top removed), which was placed against the glass under a visible hind paw. Latency to withdraw from the dry ice/glass was measured and three measurements were taken for each hind paw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec48"&gt;Thermal gradient test&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were allowed to freely explore a thermal gradient apparatus (BIOSEB), which consisted of a metal platform that was heated at one end and cooled at the other. This created a thermal gradient platform ranging from 54 °C to 6 °C. During the 60 min exploration mice were video tracked using a HD webcam and ANYMaze software, and the time in different temperature zones was analysed. This test was performed only once to avoid learning confounds. One heterozygous mouse (female) was excluded from this test owing to a camera fault during the 60 min run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec49"&gt;Tonic pain assay: formalin&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice received a single subcutaneous injection of 20 μl of 2% formalin in the left hind paw. Mice were immediately placed into a test box (5 × 5 × 10 cm), elevated on a glass platform, surrounded by angled mirrors, all above a video camera. Mice were video recorded for 1 h while the experimenter left the room. The videos were analysed offline by two blinded experimenters, each measured the duration of nocifensive behaviours (lifting, licking, flinching, shaking) of the injected hind paw every 5 min for 1 h. The first formalin phase was defined as 0–15 min, and the second phase was defined as 15–60 min.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec50"&gt;Statistical analysis and reproducibility&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec51"&gt;Biochemical assay&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;All biochemical assay data were derived from at least three independent experiments.

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers at UC San Francisco have identified a protein that's at the center of this decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They looked at how the genes and proteins in the hippocampus changed over time in mice and found just one that differed between old and young animals. It's called FTL1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old mice had more FTL1, as well as fewer connections between brain cells in the hippocampus and diminished cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the researchers artificially increased FTL1 levels in young mice, their brains and behavior began to resemble that of old mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In experiments in petri dishes, nerve cells engineered to make lots of FTL1 grew simple, one-armed neurites -- rather than the branching neurites that normal cells create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once the scientists reduced the amount of FTL1 in the hippocampus of the old mice, they regained their youth. They had more connections between nerve cells, and the mice did better on memory tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is truly a reversal of impairments," said Saul Villeda, PhD, associate director of the UCSF Bakar Aging Research Institute and senior author of the paper, which appears in &lt;em&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt; on Aug. 19. "It's much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In old mice, FTL1 also slowed down metabolism in the cells of the hippocampus. But treating the cells with a compound that stimulates metabolism prevented these effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Villeda is optimistic the work could lead to therapies that block the effects of FTL1 in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're seeing more opportunities to alleviate the worst consequences of old age," he said. "It's a hopeful time to be working on the biology of aging."&lt;/p&gt;

These animals have dealt with &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-15000225/Frankenstein-rabbits-tentacles-colorado-minnesota-nebraska.html"&gt;similar sores and growths&lt;/a&gt; on their bodies as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition spreading through deer this summer is part of the same broad family of viruses that can affect humans, known as papillomaviruses, which target the skin and mucous membranes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In humans, papillomaviruses cause conditions like common warts, plantar warts, and genital warts, and some strains are linked to cancers such as cervical or throat cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While both deer and human papillomaviruses lead to growths by infecting skin cells, the deer version is species-specific, meaning it's adapted only to infect deer and cannot jump to humans or other animals due to differences in how the virus attaches itself and enters cells in different species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deer warts can be small, like a pea, or grow as big as a football, appearing gray, black, or fleshy and often hairless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While disease-transmitting insects are believed to be the main culprit spreading the virus, direct contact with the warts may also infect deer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kristin Mansfield, a wildlife veterinarian in Washington state, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.fox13seattle.com/news/lumps-growths-washington-deer"&gt;FOX13&lt;/a&gt; that deer can spread the virus if they share the same feeding areas, sleeping spot, or rubbing posts - usually a tree males use to mark their territory during mating season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deer warts are found across the entire range of white-tailed deer in North America, so they're common throughout the US, with no specific state being much more affected than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;A video of a rabbit with Shope papilloma virus (pictured here) captivated viewers online&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Squirrel fibromatosis is caused by a virus that cannot be transmitted to people or other animals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One person on X posted an image of a deer covered in facial warts in their yard on August 13&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The warts can grow all over a deer's body, face, and legs. However, they normally fall off after a few months without causing serious harm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the condition is rarely fatal. The deer's immune system fights off the virus, and the warts shrink and disappear on their own after a few months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rare cases, if the warts grow too large or become infected with bacteria, they can cause problems like blocking a deer's vision or ability to eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One medical expert told the Daily Mail that Americans should expect diseases like this to continue spreading as temperatures get warmer throughout more of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Omer Awan of the University of Maryland School of Medicine explained that climate change has allowed mosquitoes and ticks to live longer and also spread to areas they don't normally inhabit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;On August 7, a Reddit user captured an image of a white-tailed deer in Pennsylvania with a large deer wart on its side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In late June, a Reddit users photographed a young deer with its face completely covered in warts in Milwaukee, Wisconsin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While deer can't spread deer warts to people, they can bring illnesses such as Lyme disease to populated areas, which is passed on to humans through the ticks they carry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These temperature changes are resulting in diseases that were never endemic in certain areas to become endemic,' Dr Awan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you take a look at Lyme disease, for example, we're starting to see it in areas that we never saw it before... places like southern Canada, northern states on the East Coast, like Maine,' he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In late July, a resident in Western New York preparing for hunting season captured video of an infected deer walking through the woods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The condition is believed to be spreading across the US this summer as more disease-carrying insects breed in the hotter climate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deer warts are not a new condition afflicting wildlife. Scientists believe it has been around for centuries, and studies on papillomaviruses affecting wildlife in the US go back to the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While climate changes in recent years are helping the virus to spread, Dr Awan noted that there's one other factor contributing to the increase in deer wart sightings: social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People are starting to talk about it more, they're starting to document it more on social media, and hence, there's been a lot more discussion about this,' the doctor explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Covid Vaccine Situation for the Fall Is a Complete Mess&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Katelyn Jetelina (aka Your Local Epidemiologist) has a frustrating update on how Covid vaccines are probably going to work this fall under the ideologically corrupt Trump regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA is expected to license the Covid-19 vaccine. Word is that the label will be restricted to adults 65+ and people at high risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vaccine Integrity Project and professional organizations likely won’t align with RFK Jr.’s FDA license, which will cause confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re younger than 65 and don’t have a chronic condition, could you still get it after the label change? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, but it will be complicated. While a provider could prescribe it off-label, in practice, it’s likely that most people won’t be able to access it that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jetelina continues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re under 65 and not high risk, the window to get a Covid-19 vaccine is right now — before the FDA label changes. Once it happens, access will be limited immediately (if it isn’t already). CVS is no longer booking appointments. As far as we know, Walgreens and local pharmacies still are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was as of Monday — no idea if that’s still the case. And of course, because this is the United States, insurance will probably be a mess too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recommendations from these two organizations are really important for insurers. The hope is they see them and cover all vaccines, regardless of what RFK does. It also provides extra information to physicians who will prescribe off-label if RFK Jr’s FDA changes the label (as expected) this Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will not know if any of these recommendations affect insurance coverage until insurance companies confirm coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[insert a lot of profanity here; seriously, this makes me so incandescently mad that if I wrote anything more it would contain every fucking swear word I know and then some]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a new and improved model for estimating the risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/leading-cardiologists-reveal-new-heart-disease-risk-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;emerged in November 2023&lt;/a&gt;, the calculator won raves for drawing on a larger, more contemporary, and more diverse population of Americans than its predecessors. But along with the praise came &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/10/cardiovascular-disease-statins-aha-guidelines/"&gt;predictions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/07/29/cardiovascular-risk-model-statins-heart-attacks/"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; that 40% of U.S. adults might no longer qualify for statins, the widely prescribed pills that fight artery-clogging cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those forecasts acknowledged that the second shoe had yet to drop. Equations come first, to estimate who’s at risk, but thresholds are the next step needed to establish when they might benefit from treatment. The new research concludes that a revised threshold for prescribing based on the improved risk calculator would mean roughly the same number of people qualify for a statin as before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s an important decision when cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and stroke, continues to lead all causes of death. And within that ranking, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease tops the list for causing preventable deaths and disease in American men and women. Determining a threshold that balances benefit with risk is why medical organizations have yet to issue guidelines based on the new equations. Under the existing recommendations, far fewer people who could benefit from statins actually take them now. Many who start taking them stop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamacardio.2025.2725?guestAccessKey=fb1fb899-b4e3-48b6-9561-852356054e59&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=082025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;research letter published Wednesday in JAMA Cardiology&lt;/a&gt; reveals what different thresholds would look like based on the &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;PREVENT&lt;/a&gt; model, short for Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease EVENTs, which also takes into account chronic kidney disease, diabetes, obesity, and other metabolic conditions people might have along with less-than-ideal heart health. The older Pooled Cohort Equations model, issued in 2013 and derived from less extensive data, advised statins for people whose risk of a cardiovascular event was 7.5% over 10 years. When the PREVENT model was applied using that 7.5% threshold, many fewer adults were deemed eligible for a statin. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The new analysis using PREVENT data calculated lowering that threshold to three different levels: a 3%, 4%, or 5% risk of a heart attack or stroke over 10 years. Settling the threshold for treatment at a 3% risk over 10 years would mean roughly the same number of people would qualify for a statin as do now. That lower 3% reflects the more robust data that PREVENT provides, study co-author Sadiya Khan, a preventive cardiologist and epidemiologist at Northwestern University who worked to develop PREVENT, told STAT. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even the older model encouraged a discussion between doctor and patient if the 10-year risk for a heart attack or stroke was 5%, and there was also an understanding back in 2013 that patients could benefit from statins if &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24222016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;their 10-year risk was as low as a 3%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Statins are not without risks. Some people who take them have muscle pain, but a more pressing side effect is elevated risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Data from cholesterol treatment trials have consistently shown that over about a 10-year period, 3% of people taking statins might develop diabetes. That’s more likely in people whose blood glucose levels are closing in on the criteria for a diabetes diagnosis, Khan said. But those same people with prediabetes are also at higher risk of cardiovascular disease, raising the question of whether the benefit from taking a statin might be greater than the risk of diabetes.&lt;strong&gt;   &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lowering the threshold from 7.5% was expected, in line with a trend toward a lower bar for treatment. Writing in a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2821542" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;JAMA viewpoint last year&lt;/a&gt;, Khan and colleagues said as risk prediction tools evolve with the evidence for preventive treatments, lower-risk patients than before become candidates for drug therapy to prevent cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gregg Fonarow, a cardiologist and professor of cardiovascular medicine and science at UCLA, took it a bit further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The benefit of statins exceeds risk down to a 2.5% risk over 10 years, or perhaps even lower, he said, citing reanalyses of clinical trials. He was not involved in the research letter appearing in JAMA Cardiology. The lower the risk threshold being applied, he said, the larger the number of events that would be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This new analysis provides the number of individuals in the U.S. that would be eligible for statin treatment at different risk thresholds,” he told STAT in an email. “This information will be very helpful in reformulating guidelines and efforts to reduce preventable cardiovascular events.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A guideline from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology is expected in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Keeping the number of people who might benefit the same as before, if the AHA/ACC adopt the threshold, was not the intent of the researchers, co-author Khan said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What we wanted to do here was really show what is the risk crosswalk like if you have a PREVENT score of 3% or 4% or 5%, how does that compare to the old risk threshold of 7.5% with the less accurate tool, and just try to put some data behind what does that look like in the U.S. population,” she said. “Because the PREVENT equations use more contemporary data, the risk estimate that we get is lower than the Pooled Cohort Equations. And I think we were really interested in making sure that we right-size the risk.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The PCE calculator has long been &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2015/12/22/cholesterol-statin-guidelines/"&gt;widely criticized&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2016.02.055?articleID=2517904#tab1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;overestimating risk&lt;/a&gt;, but it was more advanced than using just LDL (the “bad”) cholesterol numbers to decide who might be a candidate for a statin. Since statins were introduced in the 1980s, randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that when statins are combined with lifestyle modification, they can lower this risk of events by 25 to 40%. And they cost as little as $40 a year.&lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Sussman, a primary care physician at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, expressed concern that a threshold as low as 3% over 10 years might lead to more diabetes caused than heart attacks prevented. He did not participate in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We do not necessarily want everyone on them. We want the right people on them,” he told STAT about statins. “That said, these are wonder drugs. The right number is a pretty large number. There are a lot of Americans who would benefit. And so what we want to do is find the threshold where the benefit is just about worth it. And that’s an inherently hard and inherently subjective question.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Khan said the idea behind the risk estimation is to make sure the right people are getting a statin, independent of how many are getting a statin now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The bottom line is it’s just the math and making sure that we understand the risk and define who is eligible for statins based on who’s going to benefit,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Khan, Fonarow, and Sussman see the eventual guideline as part of conversations between doctor and patient that take individual needs and wishes into account.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There are some circumstances for which the answer is obvious: The person who had a heart attack should be on a statin,” Sussman said. “At a certain point, what is a benefit that’s real but so small it’s not worth it? It’s a combination of complex science, but also subjective human values.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average American lives to about 78 years old. The wellness industry wants you to believe you’ll only outlive that number if you buy powdered collagen, injectable peptides, or a freezer full of biohacked smoothie cubes. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;But according to Dr. Michael Aziz, a New York-based internist and regenerative medicine specialist, you don’t need to treat aging like a tech problem. You need to eat smarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-71073771" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-71073771" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-scientists-say-these-10-anti-aging-foods-actually-work"&gt;Scientists Say These 10 Anti-Aging Foods Actually Work&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These are truly anti-aging foods,” Aziz told the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/19/health/10-foods-great-for-anti-aging-including-2-blue-zone-staples-and-a-dessert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “that can help slow down aging, improve overall health, and potentially extend your lifespan for decades.” You know, assuming you’re not chain-smoking or pounding White Claws while eating them.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Here are 10 foods with real science behind them—no injections or cryotherapy required.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-dark-leafy-greens"&gt;1. Dark Leafy Greens&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The unglamorous backbone of every anti-aging diet. But there’s a reason spinach, kale, and chard show up in every study about living longer—they’re chock-full of vitamins that protect your brain and slow down cognitive decline. Eat them raw, sautéed, blended, or buried under dressing. Just eat them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-18821717" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-18821717" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-nuts"&gt;2. Nuts&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Almonds, walnuts, and Brazil nuts contain healthy fats, antioxidants, and vitamin E. They support heart health and reduce inflammation—just don’t go overboard on Brazil nuts, unless you want to experience selenium poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-fatty-fish"&gt;3. Fatty Fish&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Oily, a little stinky, and super good for you. Sardines, salmon, and mackerel are loaded with omega-3s that benefit your brain, heart, and mood. Aziz says eating fish three to four times a week could add four years to your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-75525961" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-75525961" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-berries"&gt;4. Berries&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berries are full of anthocyanins and antioxidants that help combat inflammation and blunt the cortisol spikes that quietly shave years off your life. They’re basically edible insurance. Expensive, but worth it. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-jiaogulan-tea"&gt;5. Jiaogulan Tea&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This lesser-known herbal tea is packed with polyphenols and antioxidants, potentially more than green tea. It’s consumed regularly in regions of China where people live well into their hundreds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-27459855" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-27459855" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-avocados"&gt;6. Avocados&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Loaded with heart-happy fats, vitamin E, and enough fiber to keep things moving, literally and figuratively. They’re good for your skin, great for your heart, and elite for making breakfast feel like self-care instead of survival.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-dark-chocolate"&gt;7. Dark Chocolate&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The one dessert that actually earns its spot on a health list. Rich in flavonoids, it boosts circulation and helps shield your skin from sun damage. Go for 70% cocoa or higher. The darker it is, the less sugar and the more it pulls its weight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-74067847" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-74067847" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-purple-sweet-potatoes"&gt;8. Purple Sweet Potatoes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Okinawan centenarians swear by them, and honestly, they’re doing something right as they’re one of the world’s &lt;a href="https://www.bluezones.com/"&gt;blue zones&lt;/a&gt;. Packed with antioxidants and beta-carotene, they help your cells recover and your skin glow. Plus, they look way cooler on a plate than your average beige starch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut—your gut loves this stuff, even if your roommates don’t. A healthy microbiome is linked to stronger immunity, lower inflammation, and longer life.

&lt;p&gt;They’ve never been the life of the party, but these veggies might just extend it. Packed with sulforaphane and other compounds that support detox and disease resistance, cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower are a solid bet for aging well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One day, your body will fail you. These might buy you a little grace on the way down.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For parents of school-aged children, the fall to-do list can seem ever-growing. Buy school supplies. Fill out endless school forms. Block off parent-teacher nights. Do the kids’ tennis shoes still fit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somewhere, at some point, you might remember flu shots. Get your flu shot. Get &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; flu shots. Or should you? Can you? Is that still a thing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid political chatter about vaccines and the government entities that oversee them, it’s understandable to wonder where all this leaves the 2025-26 flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short: Yes, the flu shot is still a thing. And doctors we spoke to said they recommend you get your flu shot this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some answers to common questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: I heard the Trump administration could be changing vaccine recommendations. Does that apply to the flu vaccine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been no substantial changes to the federal government’s flu vaccine recommendation: The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still says&lt;/a&gt; that people &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;6 months old&lt;/a&gt; and up should get an annual flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means most insurers will cover it, and it should soon be widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has opposed vaccines, &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/uritheflu/116880" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;agreed that most people should get the flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. He followed a recommendation from the board that advises the federal government on vaccine policy; Kennedy replaced the members with his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel voted against recommending multidose flu shots that contained the preservative thimerosal, but the preservative had &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/jun/26/thimerosal-vaccines-flu-shot-RFK-mercury/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;already been removed&lt;/a&gt; from most vaccines, including most flu shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Who should not get the flu shot?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors acknowledged there are always exceptions to broad guidance. For example, people with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/egg-allergies.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;severe allergies&lt;/a&gt; to flu vaccine components should not get vaccines that contain those components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should discuss your health situation with your physician for personalized guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Is this season’s flu shot different from last season’s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. The flu shot was updated for the upcoming flu season, but the changes &lt;a href="https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/understand-the-2025-2026-flu-vaccine-composition-recommendations" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;weren’t drastic&lt;/a&gt;. Like last year’s flu shot, this year’s vaccine is known as a three-component or &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccine-types/trivalent.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;trivalent vaccine&lt;/a&gt; that protects against three influenza viruses — two influenza A viruses and one influenza B virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This season’s vaccine was altered to target a specific strain of the influenza A/H3N2 virus expected to circulate this season, said Ryan Maves, a professor of medicine at Wake Forest University and a member of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Those &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/influenza-vaccine-composition-2025-2026-us-influenza-season" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;changes align&lt;/a&gt; with what the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/recommended-composition-of-influenza-virus-vaccines-for-use-in-the-2025-2026-nh-influenza-season" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;has recommended&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: When is the best time to get vaccinated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;September, October, or early November. This allows your body time &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-you-definitely-need-to-get-a-flu-shot-this-year" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;to build up&lt;/a&gt; its protective antibodies as flu season begins and ensures your protection doesn’t wane before it ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., influenza infection typically peaks in February, so you want to make sure you’re vaccinated and your protection is still strong through February and into March, said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Is this season’s flu vaccine guaranteed to protect against the influenza strain that’s circulating?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guarantee all protection? No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduce risk of death? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to the COVID-19 vaccine, flu vaccines are best at “protecting us from the most severe consequences of influenza,” Schaffner said. That means the flu vaccine is most effective at keeping people out of the hospital or the intensive care unit and keeping people from dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A flu vaccine may not guarantee perfect protection against the flu, but skipping your flu shot simply guarantees you’ll have no protection at all,” said Benjamin Lee, a pediatric infectious diseases physician at the University of Vermont Children’s Hospital and an associate professor at the University of Vermont Larner College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Will the flu shot be readily available this year?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All signs point to yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA passed its formula recommendations to vaccine manufacturers March 13 — early enough that the agency expected there would be “ &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/influenza-vaccine-composition-2025-2026-us-influenza-season" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;an adequate and diverse supply&lt;/a&gt;.” The people and places that administer flu shots should have them soon, typically beginning in September, said Flor Muñoz, a Baylor College of Medicine associate professor of pediatrics and infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: I heard Kennedy canceled &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-vaccines-mrna-pfizer-moderna-1fb5b9436f2957075064c18a6cbbe3c9" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$500 million in funding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;for vaccine development. Could this affect future flu vaccines?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;Kennedy announced the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-vaccines-mrna-pfizer-moderna-1fb5b9436f2957075064c18a6cbbe3c9" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;cancellation of funding&lt;/a&gt; for mRNA vaccine development. Some companies have been &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/flu-covid-combination-shot-moderna-vaccine-c627a5db5ad784335268ee6dbcb5e600" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;researching combined mRNA flu and COVID&lt;/a&gt; shots, but there are currently no approved mRNA flu vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, experts said the federal government’s changes — funding cuts, &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/jun/18/rfk-jr-fires-vaccine-panel-replacements/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;vaccine committee purges&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/13/health/fda-flu-vaccine-recommendations" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;deviations&lt;/a&gt; from existing procedures — are increasing uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;My neighbour  Sarah and I met for coffee after a decade apart. She's 68. She walked in looking maybe 48—that particular glow that comes from health, not highlighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It's not what I do," she said, stirring her coffee. "It's what I don't do."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sentiment echoes through conversations with those who seem to have negotiated a better deal with time. They haven't discovered magical serums or revolutionary treatments. Instead, they've identified the everyday habits that accelerate aging and quietly eliminated them from their lives. These aren't dramatic lifestyle overhauls—they're small subtractions that compound into visible differences over decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They skip the sugar marathon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who look youngest in their sixties treat sugar like a sometimes food, not a constant companion. This isn't about never eating dessert—it's about breaking the modern pattern of sugar at every meal, in every drink, hidden in every sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583887/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Glycation&lt;/a&gt; is what happens when sugar molecules attach to proteins in your skin, creating compounds that make collagen stiff and inflexible. Think of it as caramelizing your skin from the inside—except instead of creating a delicious crust, you're creating wrinkles and sagging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quietly young-looking among us read labels with the dedication of scholars. They know that pasta sauce doesn't need 12 grams of sugar, that "healthy" granola can pack more sugar than a candy bar. They've retrained their palates to find sweetness in actual fruit rather than fruit-flavored everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They don't worship the sun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a particular type of person who spent the 1980s basting themselves in baby oil, chasing the perfect tan. Their skin now has that specific texture—like an expensive leather handbag that's been left in a hot car. Meanwhile, their sun-avoiding contemporaries could pass for their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't about vanity. &lt;a href="https://www.skincancer.org/risk-factors/uv-radiation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;UV damage&lt;/a&gt; accumulates like credit card debt—invisibly at first, then all at once. Every sunburn, every tan, every "just five more minutes" adds microscopic damage that emerges decades later as spots, wrinkles, and that telltale leathery texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young-looking sixty-somethings weren't necessarily hiding indoors. They just made friends with shade, wore hats without irony, and discovered that SPF is less expensive than any anti-aging cream on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They refuse the cigarette invitation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one seems obvious now, but remember: today's 60-year-olds came of age when smoking was sophisticated, when ads featured doctors recommending cigarettes, when you could smoke on airplanes. Those who resisted that cultural pressure, or quit early, gave their skin a gift that keeps giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoking doesn't just cause &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/smoking-cessation/ss/slideshow-ways-smoking-affects-looks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;premature wrinkles&lt;/a&gt;—it fundamentally changes how your skin ages. It narrows blood vessels, reducing oxygen flow. It destroys collagen and elastin. It creates those vertical lip lines that no amount of lipstick can hide. The "smoker's face" that dermatologists describe isn't just about wrinkles; it's a whole constellation of changes that announce your habit decades after you've quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They don't diet dramatically&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eternally youthful sixty-somethings never did the grapefruit diet, the cabbage soup diet, or any plan that treated entire food groups like the enemy. They understood early what research now confirms: dramatic weight fluctuations age your face faster than a few stable extra pounds ever could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid weight loss doesn't give skin time to adjust. When the weight returns (and &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/yo-yo-dieting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;95% of the time&lt;/a&gt;, it does), skin stretches again. This accordion effect breaks down elastic fibers, creating the kind of sagging that makes people say "you look tired" when you're not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who look youngest maintained relatively stable weights throughout their lives. They ate actual meals instead of replacing them with shakes. They understood that sustainable beats dramatic every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They skip the midnight marathons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While their peers wore sleep deprivation like a badge of honor—pulling all-nighters for work, staying out until 4 AM, wearing "I'll sleep when I'm dead" t-shirts—the young-looking ones were home by 11, in bed by midnight, treating sleep like the biological necessity it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic sleep deprivation doesn't just create dark circles. It triggers a cascade of hormonal changes that accelerate aging at the cellular level. Cortisol rises, breaking down collagen. Growth hormone drops, slowing skin repair. The result isn't just looking tired—it's looking older, faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-preserved sixty-somethings protected their sleep with the ferocity of new parents. They said no to the third drink, the late meeting, the Netflix binge. They understood that beauty sleep isn't a luxury—it's maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They don't stress professionally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a subset of sixty-somethings who chased every promotion, answered every email within minutes, treated their careers like a competitive sport. You can see it in their faces—the permanent furrow between their brows, the tight jaw, the stress-aged skin that looks like it's been marinated in cortisol for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/stress/body" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Chronic stress&lt;/a&gt; literally shortens your telomeres—the protective caps on your chromosomes that determine how quickly you age. It shows up as inflammation, which manifests as puffiness, redness, and premature aging. The body keeps score, and stress always collects its debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young-looking ones learned to compartmentalize. They left work at work. They understood that no email is so urgent it can't wait until morning, that success without sustainability is just delayed failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They avoid the beige food diet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walk through any grocery store and notice how much of our food has been processed into uniform beige—crackers, cookies, chips, bread, pasta. The sixty-somethings who look youngest made friends with color early—the deep reds of berries, the dark greens of leafy vegetables, the bright oranges of sweet potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These colors aren't just pretty—they're &lt;a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/antioxidants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; in edible form. They fight the free radicals that break down collagen, cause inflammation, and accelerate aging. Every colorful meal is a small investment in your future face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young-looking ones didn't become health food zealots. They just noticed that real food doesn't have ingredients lists, that things that grow from the ground tend to help you age more slowly than things made in factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. They don't become their couch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sixty-somethings who could pass for forty-five never let convenience eliminate all effort from their lives. They're not gym obsessives or marathon runners. They just kept moving—taking stairs, walking to the store, dancing in their kitchens while cooking dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sedentary living ages you inside-out. It slows the circulation that delivers oxygen to your skin. It shrinks the muscles that hold everything up. Eventually, gravity wins by default, creating that characteristic sag that no cream can lift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movement doesn't have to mean exercise. The best-preserved sixty-somethings simply refused to let convenience eliminate all physical effort from their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. They skip the anger addiction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people collect grievances like stamps, nurturing old wounds, rehearsing arguments from 1987. You can see it in their faces—the permanent scowl lines, the tight mouth, the way their default expression looks like they're perpetually smelling something unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic anger triggers the same stress hormones as any other chronic stress, with the added bonus of creating specific facial patterns that become permanent over time. &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/forgiveness/art-20047692" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Forgiveness&lt;/a&gt;, it turns out, is a beauty treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young-looking ones learned to let things go—not for others, but for themselves. They understood that holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to age faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. They don't chase youth desperately&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the sixty-somethings who look youngest aren't the ones desperately trying to look young. They're not getting excessive procedures, wearing teenage fashion, or pretending decades haven't passed. They've accepted their age while refusing to accelerate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something aging about the desperate pursuit of youth—the too-tight face from excessive procedures, the inappropriate clothing that highlights rather than hides aging, the exhausting effort of pretending. Authenticity, surprisingly, is more youthful than any attempt at reversal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking young at sixty isn't about discovering secrets—it's about avoiding the obvious mistakes we've normalized. The people who seem to age in slow motion haven't found the fountain of youth; they've simply noticed which everyday habits are fountains of aging and walked past them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is moral judgment. There's beauty and value in every face, regardless of how many years it shows. But for those curious about the gap between chronological and visible age, the answer rarely involves expensive interventions. More often, it's about what you didn't do—the sugar you didn't eat, the sun you didn't worship, the stress you didn't nurture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real insight might be this: we spend fortunes on products to reverse aging while actively participating in habits that accelerate it. It's like pressing the gas and brake simultaneously, then wondering why the journey feels so rough. Sometimes the most powerful anti-aging strategy is simply lifting your foot off the accelerator.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Virginia Department of Health has been notified of a confirmed case of measles at Dulles International Airport on Aug. 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient is from another state, the VDH said in a Tuesday news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are coordinating an effort to identify people who might have been exposed, including contacting potentially exposed passengers on specific flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listed below is the date, time and location of the potential exposure site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dulles International Airport (IAD) on Tuesday, Aug. 12: in the main terminal, at the TSA security checkpoint, in Concourse B, and on transportation from the main terminal to Concourse B between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential exposure is &lt;a href="https://www.insidenova.com/headlines/vdh-investigates-another-measles-exposure-in-northern-virginia/article_82001cde-6408-4dcd-b8a9-5fa9711d0133.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one of several&lt;/a&gt; involving travelers through Virginia this year. The state has also seen &lt;a href="https://www.insidenova.com/culpeper/virginias-third-measles-case-of-the-year-reported-in-charlottesville-area/article_14954e5c-9bb4-457e-b8dd-c372e2b9ddea.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;three confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; among Virginia residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious illness that can spread easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes, according to the VDH. Measles symptoms usually appear in two stages. In the first stage, most people have a fever of greater than 101 degrees, runny nose, watery red eyes, and a cough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early symptoms usually start seven to 14 days after being exposed. The second stage starts three to five days after symptoms start, when a rash begins to appear on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. People with measles are contagious from four days before the rash appears through four days after the rash appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the latest information on measles cases and exposures in Virginia, visit the &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/measles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;VDH Measles website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check your immunization status, call your healthcare provider or request your vaccination records using the VDH Immunization Record Request Form. Virginia residents with additional questions about their potential exposure can email &lt;a href="mailto:epi_response@vdh.virginia.gov"&gt;epi_response@vdh.virginia.gov&lt;/a&gt; or contact your local health department.&lt;/p&gt;

KENNEDY JR. was named secretary of health and human services, a certain kind of voter was thrilled. Some were Democrats, some were Republicans, and others were independents, but they were united in their belief that the nation was beset by a health disaster that could be laid at the feet of the government and experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Calley Means, a former Republican lobbyist and now an official at the Department of Health and Human Services (and the brother of surgeon general nominee Casey Means), spoke for this constituency when he explained that he supported Kennedy &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/15/nx-s1-5191947/trump-rfk-health-hhs" rel&gt;because&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; “The public health–expert class has given us a public health collapse. We are on the verge of, at best, a health crisis and, at worst, a societal collapse with 20 percent of GDP going to health expenditures. [We’re] getting sicker, fatter, more depressed, more infertile for every dollar we spend.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fomenting suspicion about vaccines and food additives while pushing miracle diets (Kennedy’s includes no candy but plenty of fast food, as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/robert-f-kennedy-jr-candy-snap-confectioners-association-lobbying-junk-food-health-hhs" rel&gt;Joe Perticone points out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) has made many an influencer wealthy and famous. Heck, it made one a cabinet secretary. Though these obsessives have always been with us, the Trump moment has given them new power because their conspiracy-mindedness fits seamlessly into the MAGA analysis of the world: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are not responsible for anything that has gone awry in your life. It’s the work of sinister elites who’ve betrayed you. They’ve shipped your job overseas, halved your neighbor’s salary through bad trade deals, stolen elections, and picked your pocket to support failed forever wars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; In that spirit, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/rfk-conspiracy-theories-fact-check.html" rel&gt;notions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that vaccines cause autism, that antidepressants cause school shootings, and that COVID-19 spares Jews and Asians seem to demand a fair hearing. It’s a “Burn the Witches” level of analysis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the early days of Trump 2.0, even &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/10/31/maha-make-america-healthy-again-trump-rfk-jr/" rel&gt;reasonable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; adults who should know better told reporters that it might be good to have Kennedy as our chief public health officer because, after all, we do have a serious problem with chronic health conditions like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. GOP senators &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/newsreleases/crapo-supports-rfk-jr-for-hhs-secretary" rel&gt;praised&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; his &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.marshall.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senator-marshall-releases-statement-after-voting-to-confirm-robert-f-kennedy-jr-as-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/" rel&gt;focus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on chronic diseases and predicted that he would bring a “fresh perspective” to health care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the reality is that most of what causes chronic medical conditions in America is almost entirely outside the remit of government. Obesity, lack of exercise, smoking, drinking, and poor diet all contribute mightily to chronic poor health—and they are behaviors that are extremely difficult to change. By contrast, government is indispensable in certain crucial areas—prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, promoting research on new drugs, and funding scientific studies on best practices. In all of those, Kennedy is not only failing to do his job well; he is doing the exact opposite of what he should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It isn’t popular for politicians or activists to acknowledge, but most chronic conditions that afflict Americans are the result of personal choices. Please don’t get me wrong: People get cancer and Parkinson’s and ALS and lots of other ailments due to simple bad luck. But chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes, obesity, and heart disease are closely linked to behavior. It’s possible to do everything right and still get these diseases, but it’s much more common for people who have unhealthy habits to succumb. Even cancer rates can be affected by eating habits: consuming lots of fruits and vegetables has been shown to be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7173711/" rel&gt;protective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; against &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wcrf.org/preventing-cancer/topics/fruit-vegetables-and-cancer/" rel&gt;several&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; forms of cancer. Again, this is not to blame people for their diseases or to suggest in any way that they don’t deserve treatment and care. Neither is it to suggest that what people eat is entirely a function of what they choose, as opposed to what is available to them at an affordable price. But as a matter of epidemiology, it’s important to be clear-eyed about what we can control and what we can’t. There are plenty of wealthy Americans who could easily make healthier choices and don’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People who are obese have a 28 percent higher risk of heart disease than do people of normal weight. Carrying excessive extra pounds also &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/alert/being-overweight-or-obese-is-linked-with-heart-disease-even-without-other-metabolic-risk-factors/" rel&gt;increases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; cancer rates, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2621047/" rel&gt;stillbirths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, preeclampsia,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/adult-overweight-obesity/health-risks" rel&gt; strokes, arthritis, type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, infertility, gout, and mental health challenges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting for most of every day also does not conduce to good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We Americans (and, to be fair, many people around the globe) do a lot of that. A British &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28645071/" rel&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that adults who watch six or more hours of TV a day had twice the all-cause mortality of those who watched two hours or less.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Everyone knows that the best path to good health is eating healthy foods, getting a decent amount of exercise, avoiding cigarettes, drinking alcohol in small amounts (no more than 1 drink per day for women, 2 for men), and maintaining a healthy body weight. A &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.032047?dom=newscred&amp;amp;src=syn" rel&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Circulation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that women who followed these recommendations lived an average of 14 years longer than those who did not, and men lived an extra 12. But take a guess at how many American adults actually follow all five of those recommendations? According to a University of Oregon &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.orlandohealth.com/content-hub/more-than-97-of-americans-dont-follow-a-healthy-lifestyle#:~:text=The%20study%2C%20conducted%20by%20Oregon%20State%20University,healthy%2C%20don%27t%20smoke%20and%20get%20regular%20exercise." rel&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, only 2.7 percent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, yes, we are plagued by diabetes, heart disease, strokes, and cancer. But it’s not because we use food dyes (though by all means, remove food dyes, we don’t need them), or because drug companies have conspired to keep us sick, or because &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2023/jul/10/rfk-jrs-wi-fi-claim-about-human-blood-brain-barrie/" rel&gt;WiFi is frying our brains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, or due to fluoride in water (though in some jurisdictions, levels may&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/11/14/fluoride-water-kennedy-rfk-brain-development/" rel&gt; be a bit too high&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;). The only way to grapple with these conditions is to change our behavior—and that’s hard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, what is not hard, or shouldn’t be, is to hire a government that does the basics of public health, like empanel experts to advise on the composition of the yearly flu vaccine, or provide guidance on which vaccines are needed for children and at what ages, or fund research on vaccines to prevent future pandemics. On all of these fronts, Kennedy has done the opposite, disbanding &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/09/uspstf-rfk-jr-meeting-canceled-preventive-care/" rel&gt;advisory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; committees of academics and physicians, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/18/opinion/mrna-vaccines.html" rel&gt;canceling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; funding for mRNA vaccine research, changing the recommendation for COVID vaccines for pregnant women and babies, and creating a panel stacked with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/08/19/opinion/vaccines-autism-evidence.html?unlocked_article_code=1.fU8.V0tv.bA8BHK74N7I7&amp;amp;smid=url-share" rel&gt;frauds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to “reexamine” the non-existent link between the MMR vaccine and autism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can take this to the bank: Kennedy’s crusade will not overcome our chronic disease problem. But it is very probable, if he is not stopped, that former plagues like measles will make a big comeback; that we will be far less prepared to cope with the next epidemic because we cut research on the miracle of mRNA technology; that rates of vaccine hesitancy will continue to rise; and that trust in government professionalism will be shattered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rfk-jr-cant-fix-americas-healthand?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rfk-jr-cant-fix-americas-healthand?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Bulwark</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 12:54:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE94QjhRa1p0THBvVmtTZkJObmhpQ0NqRGEwUHE2V0FkWENHY1hYajhWZjlsWGs3Sk9LZ0FsWVRiVkpVUkszNmxwZF9zWWhSTzJwX042eWUtZHdDa1dCWElvTjJuSTFVUktIX2RTRjRXVHI</guid></item><item><title>超加工食品不是我们饮食中真正的恶棍吗？以下是我们的研究发现-研究发现</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPajNZcll1WHR0S1ZWbjVONlY3bGZLN05ZQWlBSnQ3RDRHN2JCM0hFNGczTWgtZndiLWlBRFNkUjduZU54c2h1cVc0OGtxRHczRkZYX2haLTFpNVNuWk5jVnpURmFnMVZKSmZ1aG84Zkk1bEpUZWFvb2FkNXl0TW9TNA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;div class="post-featured-image"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food perceptions matter&lt;/strong&gt;: People’s beliefs about whether a food is sweet, fatty, or processed strongly influenced overeating—sometimes as much as the food’s actual nutrients.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultra-processed food (UPF) labels add little&lt;/strong&gt;: Once nutrients and perceptions were factored in, the UPF classification explained only 2–4% of overeating behavior.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not all UPFs are harmful&lt;/strong&gt;: While many are calorie-dense and easy to overeat, others—like fortified cereals or vegan alternatives—can be beneficial depending on context.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy implications&lt;/strong&gt;: Blanket warnings on UPFs may mislead consumers. A more effective approach is boosting food literacy, designing satisfying foods, and addressing why people eat beyond hunger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) have become public enemy number one in nutrition debates. From dementia to obesity and an epidemic of “food addiction,” these &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/processed-foods" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;factory-made products&lt;/a&gt;, including chips, ready-made meals, sugary drinks and packaged snacks, are blamed for a wide range of modern health problems. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-025-01143-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Some experts argue&lt;/a&gt; that they’re “specifically formulated and aggressively marketed to maximize consumption and corporate profits,” hijacking our brain’s reward systems to make us eat beyond our needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-response-to-the-house-of-lords-food-and-health-report/government-response-to-the-house-of-lords-food-diet-and-obesity-committees-report-recipe-for-health-a-plan-to-fix-our-broken-food-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Policymakers have proposed&lt;/a&gt; bold interventions: warning labels, marketing restrictions, taxes, even outright bans near schools. But how much of this urgency is based on solid evidence?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My colleagues and I wanted to step back and ask: what actually makes people like a food? And what drives them to overeat – not just enjoy it, but keep eating &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/fatty-foods-rewire-brain-calories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;after hunger&lt;/a&gt; has passed? &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195666325001825?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;We studied more than 3,000 UK adults&lt;/a&gt; and their responses to over 400 everyday foods. What we found challenges the simplistic UPF narrative and offers a more nuanced way forward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two ideas often get blurred in nutrition discourse: liking a food and hedonic overeating (eating for pleasure rather than hunger). Liking is about taste. Hedonic overeating is about continuing to eat because the food feels good. They’re related, but not identical. Many people like oatmeal but rarely binge on it. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/chocolate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chocolate&lt;/a&gt;, cookies and ice cream, on the other hand, top both lists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We conducted three large online studies where participants rated photos of unbranded food portions for how much they liked them and how likely they were to overeat them. The foods were recognizable items from a typical UK shopping basket: jacket potatoes, apples, noodles, cottage pie, custard creams – more than 400 in total.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We then compared these responses with three things: the foods’ nutritional content (fat, sugar, fiber, energy density), their classification as ultra-processed by the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-022-01099-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;widely used Nova system&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11575809/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a food classification method&lt;/a&gt; that groups foods by the extent and purpose of their processing – and how people perceived them (sweet, fatty, processed, healthy and so on).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-perception-power"&gt;Perception Power&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some findings were expected: people liked foods they ate often, and calorie-dense foods were more likely to lead to overeating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the more surprising insight came from the role of beliefs and perceptions. Nutrient content mattered – people rated high-fat, high-carb foods as more enjoyable, and low-fiber, high-calorie foods as more “bingeable.” But what people believed about the food also mattered, a lot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perceiving a food as sweet, fatty or highly processed increased the likelihood of overeating, regardless of its actual nutritional content. Foods believed to be bitter or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/fiber/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high in fiber&lt;/a&gt; had the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195666325001825?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;In one survey&lt;/a&gt;, we could predict 78% of the variation in people’s likelihood of overeating by combining nutrient data (41%) with beliefs about the food and its sensory qualities (another 38%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In short: how we think about food affects how we eat it, just as much as what’s actually in it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This brings us to ultra-processed foods. Despite the intense scrutiny, classifying a food as “ultra-processed” added very little to our predictive models.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once we accounted for nutrient content and food perceptions, the Nova classification explained less than 2% of the variation in liking and just 4% in overeating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/ultra-processed-foods-30-health-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;not to say all UPFs are harmless&lt;/a&gt;. Many are high in calories, low in fiber and easy to over-consume. But the UPF label is a blunt instrument. It lumps together &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sugary-drinks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sugary soft drinks&lt;/a&gt; with fortified cereals, protein bars with vegan meat alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of these products &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2025/spotlight-upfs-nih-explores-link-between-ultra-processed-foods-and-heart-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;may be less healthy&lt;/a&gt;, but others can be helpful – especially for older adults with low appetites, people on restricted diets or those seeking convenient nutrition. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The message that all UPFs are bad &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/step-4-eat-and-live-smart/cholesterol-smart-upfs#Can-UPFs-be-heart-healthy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;oversimplifies the issue&lt;/a&gt;. People don’t eat based on food labels alone. They eat based on how a food tastes, how it makes them feel and how it fits with their health, social or emotional goals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Relying on UPF labels to shape policy could backfire. Warning labels might steer people away from foods that &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/step-4-eat-and-live-smart/cholesterol-smart-upfs#which-UPFs-can-be-heart-healthy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;are actually beneficial&lt;/a&gt;, like whole grain cereals, or create confusion about what’s genuinely unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, we recommend a more informed, personalized approach:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;• Boost food literacy: help people understand what makes food satisfying, what drives cravings, and how to recognize their personal cues for overeating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;• Reformulate with intention: design food products that are enjoyable and filling, rather than relying on bland “diet” options or ultra-palatable snacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;• Address eating motivations: people eat for many reasons beyond hunger – for comfort, connection and pleasure. Supporting alternative habits while maximizing enjoyment could reduce dependence on low-quality foods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-s-not-just-about-processing"&gt;It’s Not Just About Processing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some UPFs &lt;a href="https://post.parliament.uk/research-briefings/post-pb-0059/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;do deserve concern. They’re calorie-dense&lt;/a&gt;, aggressively marketed and often sold in oversized portions. But they’re not a smoking gun.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Labeling entire categories of food as bad based purely &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/processed-foods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;on their processing&lt;/a&gt; misses the complexity of eating behavior. What drives us to eat and overeat is complicated but not beyond understanding. We now &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663318/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;have the data&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666324004963" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;and models&lt;/a&gt; to unpack those motivations and support people in building healthier, more satisfying diets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the nutritional and sensory &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/food/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;characteristics of food&lt;/a&gt; – and how we perceive them – matter more than whether something came out of a packet. If we want to encourage better eating habits, it’s time to stop demonizing food groups and start focusing on the psychology behind our choices.&lt;/p&gt;

But there’s one surprising biological change that researchers are just starting to uncover, thanks to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022227525001270" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of Lipid Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Lipid Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, found that people with Alzheimer’s disease experience a breakdown in the ability to shuttle cholesterol to the neurons in their brain, and that this symptom is linked to a certain genetic variant called APOE4, which carries a known risk for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This biological discovery could potentially pave the way for a better understanding of the disease and even future disease prevention methods. Here’s what you need to know about the science so far, with input from a neurologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the expert&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil, DO;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil, DO&lt;/a&gt;, is a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the researchers find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed the cerebrospinal fluid (the biological liquid that surrounds and cushions the brain and spinal cord) from 10 patients with Alzheimer’s disease and compared it to the cerebrospinal fluid of 10 people who did not have the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They discovered that lipoproteins (round particles made of fat and protein) in the cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer's patients were less effective at delivering cholesterol to neurons, or nerve cells, which are responsible for transmitting information from the brain throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is cholesterol? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol is an essential, waxy, fat-like molecule that your body needs for good health, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/blood-cholesterol" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Heart Lung and Blood Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Heart Lung and Blood Institute&lt;/a&gt; (NHLBI). Cholesterol is carried around your body by two types of lipoproteins: low-density lipoproteins (a.k.a. LDL or “bad” cholesterol) and high-density lipoproteins (a.k.a. HDL or “good” cholesterol).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64894213/how-to-improve-cardiovasular-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:LDL cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; can cause a buildup of fatty deposits called plaque in your arteries, raising the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other health complications, per the NHLBI. But high levels of good HDL cholesterol may lower the risk for certain health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it important for brain function?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it has a bad rap in the health world, cholesterol is actually really important for your proper brain function. Your brain is the most &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197018623001638" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197018623001638" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:-rich organ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;-rich organ&lt;/a&gt; in your body. Specifically, cholesterol helps make up cell membranes, including those in nerve cells, and plays a crucial role in your neurons' ability to "talk" to each other and transmit information. When cholesterol levels are out of balance, it can impact that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs12276-024-01273-4&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65821905%2Fcholesterol-alzheimers-link-apoe4-study%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:transmission of essential information;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;transmission of essential information&lt;/a&gt; between nerve cells, leading to cognitive issues that are seen with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. Cholesterol is also a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/165/4/bqae032/7631422" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:building block;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;building block&lt;/a&gt; for steroid hormones, which support brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, that doesn't mean more cholesterol is always good for your brain. High levels of LDL cholesterol are usually considered a modifiable risk factor for ischemic stroke, or “clogged pipes” in the brain, explains Clifford Segil, DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is less research and understanding on the possible benefits of cholesterol found in spinal fluid including HDL, which we classically identify as the ‘good cholesterol,’” Dr. Segil says. “We know high levels of certain types of cholesterol cause strokes and we are less clear in the year 2025 about the benefits of cholesterol in brain function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this link back to Alzheimer’s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular study noted that cholesterol found in lipoproteins were different in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, but Dr. Segil says that there is a “complicated” relationship between lipids and protein in the brain. “Some researchers continue to assign memory loss symptoms in patients with Alzheimer’s due to abnormal brain protein levels and this paper noted lipid brain levels may also be abnormal,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Segil points out that neurologists commonly prescribe medications called statins to lower levels of cholesterol and the risk of stroke. Lowering levels of LDL cholesterol can decrease the risk of developing certain type of dementia, including vascular dementia, he says.

But according to OB-GYN, surgeon and co-host of the &lt;a href="https://www.shemdpodcast.com/" target="_blank"&gt;She MD podcast&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Thais Aliabadi, there are numerous other tests that women should also be receiving to better understand their health and prevent possibly life-threatening conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-39e61d" class="body-graf"&gt;The questions you should be asking at the doctor depend on your stage of life, Aliabadi explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dfd82c" class="body-graf"&gt;For example, if a teenage girl is struggling with painful or irregular periods, Aliabadi wants her to know that’s not normal and that she should be screened for endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). For women of reproductive age interested in knowing more about their fertility, it’s possible to find out your egg count. And if you’re approaching menopause and losing sleep, gaining weight or experiencing other changes, you should bring these up at your check-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-53d56f" class="body-graf"&gt;Unfortunately, many OB-GYNs don’t prioritize gathering as much information as they can about patients because they have limited time per patient, Aliabadi says. That’s why it’s important for women to be their own advocates when it comes to their symptoms and important health screenings, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc2606" class="body-graf"&gt;Here’s her checklist to take to your next well woman visit, depending on your stage of life. And many of these, if not all, will be covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-aaeac4" class="body-heading"&gt;Teens to 40s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="anchor-ee046f" class="body-heading"&gt;Screenings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-d743e1" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;General history&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breast exam&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breast imaging (mammogram, ultrasound and MRI, depending on your risk)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pelvic exam and ultrasound&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pap smear and HPV&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sexually transmitted infections&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Screening for underlying health conditions (PCOS, endometriosis, insulin resistance, thyroid dysfunction and autoimmune disorders)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mental health screenings for conditions including anxiety, depression and eating disorders&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breast cancer risk assessment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genetic testing if there is a family history of cancer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Egg count test (AMH)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hormone panel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="anchor-ee37fe" class="body-heading"&gt;Conditions to Be Aware of&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-44ff50" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PCOS: &lt;/strong&gt;Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition where the ovaries make higher-than-normal levels of androgens, or male-type hormones. This can interfere with ovulation and raise the risk of infertility, diabetes and heart disease. Common signs include irregular or missed periods, excess hair growth, acne and weight changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bedbdf" class="body-graf"&gt;There isn’t a single test for PCOS, and diagnosis is based on a combination of symptoms, blood tests to check hormone levels, and an ultrasound to look at the ovaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3037cb" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endometriosis: &lt;/strong&gt;Endometriosis affects 10% of women and is one of the top causes of infertility, according to Aliabadi. It is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside of it. Common signs include very painful periods, pain with sex, and bowel or bladder pain during menstruation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-02bd23" class="body-graf"&gt;Many women face years of delays before getting a diagnosis. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, a pelvic exam, imaging such as ultrasound or MRI, and sometimes laparoscopy, a minor surgery that allows doctors to look inside the pelvis directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f8de81" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breast cancer: &lt;/strong&gt;Aliabadi wants every woman to know her lifetime risk of breast cancer by age 30, using tools like &lt;a href="https://www.shemdpodcast.com/risk-calculator" target="_blank"&gt;the Tyrer-Cuzick Risk Calculator&lt;/a&gt;. For most women, breast imaging should start at age 40, but if there’s a family history, start 10 years before your youngest affected relative’s diagnosis. Women at high risk — 20% or more in their lifetime — may need to begin screening as early as age 30, and women with genetic mutations may need to start as early as 25. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-24714b" class="body-graf"&gt;Genetic testing is especially important for women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, since results can guide when and how screening begins. Women with dense breasts or a high lifetime risk of breast cancer benefit from extra imaging such as ultrasound or MRI (in addition to mammograms). Aliabadi also recommends 3D mammography for women with dense breast tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4790e4" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccine-preventable illnesses: &lt;/strong&gt;Make sure you are up to date on important vaccines, such as HPV, COVID, Tdap, as well as the flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-a79790" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perimenopause and Menopause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="anchor-75b75f" class="body-heading"&gt;Screenings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-8ac13f" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;General history&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pelvic ultrasound&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mammogram and other indicated breast imaging (ultrasound or MRI)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hormone testing, especially if experiencing menopause symptoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Colonoscopy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bone density test (DXA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart health: full lipid panel including APOB and lipoprotein (a), hs-CRP (inflammation marker), fasting glucose, HbA1c&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coronary calcium scan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dementia markers, such as Apoe4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Metabolic health markers, such as blood sugar, thyroid and vitamin levels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genetic testing, if there’s a new family history of cancer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="anchor-2023f4" class="body-heading"&gt;Conditions to Be Aware of&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9f6b83" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perimenopause and menopause symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;These can include hair loss, hot flashes, sleep problems, vaginal dryness, painful sex, mood swings, brain fog and weight gain, especially in the abdomen. The good news is many of these are treatable, Aliabadi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d527ed" class="body-graf"&gt;If you experience any of these, you don’t need to “tough it out,” she adds. Bring them up with your doctor. Depending on your symptoms and health history, your doctor may order tests such as estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, FSH, LH, thyroid function, vitamin D, cholesterol and HbA1c. Based on results, treatment options may include hormone therapy, non-hormonal medications or local vaginal estrogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-86eb14" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccine-preventable illnesses: &lt;/strong&gt;Older women should be up to date on flu, Tdap, shingles, pneumonia and COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-d00b93" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dcf4c3" class="body-graf"&gt;Ultimately, Aliabadi wants women to know that they don’t need to muscle through uncomfortable symptoms, whether it’s painful periods as a teen or hot flashes later in life. And it’s important to be proactive about hormone health before perimenopause, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1562b0" class="body-graf"&gt;If you’re interested in having children, you should seek info about your fertility potential, and it’s key to start healthy habits before perimenopause to protect bone and heart health. These include eating a balanced diet of mostly whole foods and regular exercise, especially strength training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-59812d" class="body-graf"&gt;“A woman’s exam should never be just a Pap smear, a pelvic exam, or a breast check. It needs to be a comprehensive look at her whole health, from conditions like PCOS and endometriosis that affect fertility, to awareness of perimenopause symptoms, heart and bone health, and everything in between,” Aliabadi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2e117b" class="body-graf"&gt;“The goal is not only to treat problems as they arise, but to anticipate risks, protect long-term health and empower women to thrive at every stage of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4bcd5d" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;For more information about women’s health from Aliabadi, visit &lt;a href="http://shemd.com" target="_blank"&gt;SheMD.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNQWNFeW5vdmE3dllLeW1Md1ZqM3dEMy0zTUNmdG5yWFRDaDlnLTdaT0U1bENfcVVBUXZuMTJPZEgybVVFTmJZQ2dTZXZxWkFTMzZfeXRMYXdELVM1d1IzUTg2MWZHZUZ6RFZ0YlNQMmxya01ya3M0ZE5UZ3lDVzhJaDRkaVpEQUHSAVRBVV95cUxPNUpiaVNCLU1lZzRod25RQ2FfZDdWbTVoR0hDQXlnQWpqb1dQcDJFaGNlUnZacFZaNmp5b3RmY1FHVDZhZ3RaMk42ZTdsQVRvSFotZG4</guid></item><item><title>黄金猎犬在两周后与父母团聚时的“机场快乐哭声” - yahoo.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxPRTJVU2ZBUDVSa2t4QklSdkZvWWlJUFhBYW5KcHlubkhzVHEtQzdpcjBYeGtoUkNhdXgyTjBmSDhHZ1dTVGd0S2wyNzBJZHg5MTM3dzJVU1lFWnJLeTJPU3JIZFQ1Y2dEem1DbFZNd2U3aDc0bU5SSjJ4UWFzVkNwMXJyVXl4b041N1NER1J3by1aSlhpekYzSw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/pet-news/golden-retrievers-airport-happy-cries-while-reuniting-with-parents-after-2-weeks-are-everything" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever's 'Airport Happy Cries' While Reuniting With Parents After 2 Weeks Are Everything;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever's 'Airport Happy Cries' While Reuniting With Parents After 2 Weeks Are Everything&lt;/a&gt; originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PetHelpful;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PetHelpful&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Any pet parent will tell you that leaving your beloved fur baby to go on vacation is just so tough.

A hiking path crosses the expanse of long grasses and berry bushes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As Hokit walks the path, he carries a handmade tool made out of plastic pipes taped together that hold a large rectangle of white flannel cloth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He jokes that this device is "sophisticated," but the scientific survey is quite serious: He's sweeping the cloth over the shrubs and grass, hoping that "questing" ticks will latch on.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Along the summer trail, ticks dangle from blades of grass, sticking their legs out and waiting for a passing mammal.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We got one," Hokit says. "So that came off of this sedge grass right here… simply pick them off with our fingers. We've got a vial that we pop them in."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Any captured ticks will go back to Hokit's lab in Helena for identification. Most of them will likely be identified as Rocky Mountain wood ticks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Hokit also wants to find out if new species are making their way into the state.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As human-driven climate change makes winters shorter, ticks are spending less time hibernating and have more active months when they can hitch rides on animals and people. Sometimes the ticks carry themselves — and &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-lyme-disease" target="_blank"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt; — to new parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hokit found &lt;a href="https://www.mtpr.org/2025-05-27/briefs-grizzly-bear-deaths-meat-processing-funds-deer-ticks-detected" target="_blank"&gt;deer ticks for the first time&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year in northeastern Montana. Deer ticks are infamous for transmitting Lyme disease and can infect people with &lt;a href="https://www.ticklab.org/blog/2020/06/30/diseases-transmitted-by-blacklegged-deer-tick-bites/" target="_blank"&gt;other pathogens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-83651" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Hokit finds and identifies ticks alongside a trail outside Condon, Mont. These surveys help public health officials understand where ticks are in Montana and detect new species that have migrated on large mammals like deer. Hokit found deer ticks, which are known to carry Lyme disease, earlier this year in northeast Montana.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Knowing a new species like the deer tick has arrived in Montana or other states is important for doctors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr.&lt;a href="https://providers.billingsclinic.com/provider/tsun-sheng-n-ku/2068410" target="_blank"&gt; Neil Ku&lt;/a&gt; is an infectious disease specialist at Billings Clinic in eastern Montana. He says most patients don't come in right after they get bitten by a tick. They usually show up later, when they start feeling sick from a tick-borne illness.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Fever, some chills, they may just feel bad, similar to many infections we may encounter throughout the year," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's rare that patients connect a tick bite to those symptoms and even more rare that they capture and keep the tick that bit them. Sorting out whether someone might have a tick-borne illness can be complicated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Knowing what ticks are in the region will help doctors know that they might start encountering patients infected with new diseases after a tick bite, Ku says&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's partially why the state is on the hunt for new tick species.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The more we know about what's in Montana, the better we can inform our physicians, the better care you can receive," said &lt;a href="https://dphhs.mt.gov/publichealth/cdepi/contact" target="_blank"&gt;Devon Cozart&lt;/a&gt;, a zoonotic illness and vector-borne disease epidemiologist with the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cozart collects and tests the ticks from field surveys in Montana to see whether they are carrying any pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Whether a tick can get a human sick depends on the species, but the kind of mammal on which it feeds also plays a role.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Usually it's a rodent that might be carrying, for example, Rocky Mountain spotted fever. So, the tick will feed on that rodent, then will get the pathogen as well," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because the prevalence of a particular disease can vary in mammal populations, ticks in one part of the state could be more or less likely to get you sick. That's also important information for medical providers, says Cozart.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This kind of surveillance and testing isn't happening in every state or county. A 2023 &lt;a href="https://www.naccho.org/uploads/downloadable-resources/Vector-Assessment-2023-Sep.2024.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; of nearly 500 health departments around the country found that roughly a quarter do some kind of tick surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Not all&lt;a href="https://www.naccho.org/uploads/downloadable-resources/Local_EH_Department_Tick_Activities_Final.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; surveillance efforts&lt;/a&gt; are equal, says &lt;a href="https://virtualcommunities.naccho.org/thrivecommunitiesofpractice/people/chelsea-gridley-smith" target="_blank"&gt;Chelsea Gridley-Smith&lt;/a&gt;, director of environmental health at the National Association of City and County Health Officials.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Field surveys can be expensive. For numerous local and state health departments, tick surveillance relies on a less expensive, more passive approach. Concerned patients, veterinarians and doctors must collect and send in ticks for identification.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It does provide a little information about what ticks are actually interacting with people and animals, but it doesn't get into the weeds of how common ticks are in that area and how often do those ticks carry pathogens," said Gridley-Smith.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says more health departments want to start tick surveillance, but getting funding is hard and might get harder as federal public health grants from agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dry up.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Montana receives about $60,000 from a federal grant annually, but the bulk of that funding goes toward mosquito surveillance, which is more intensive and costly. What's left funds trips into the field to look for ticks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hokit says he doesn't have enough funding for his small team to survey everywhere he would like to in a state as large as Montana. That means he's unable to monitor emerging populations of deer ticks as closely as he would like.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He found those new deer ticks in two Montana counties, but he doesn't have enough data to determine whether they have begun reproducing there, establishing a local population.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Hokit uses data on climate and vegetation to make predictions about where deer ticks might thrive in the state. He has his eye on particular areas of western Montana, like the Flathead Valley.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says that will help his team narrow down where to look next so they can let the public know when deer ticks — and the disease they can carry — arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

He marinated it in garlic vinegar and cooked it medium-rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;To this day, he has not forgotten it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I woke up at 2am with major stomach cramps and thought I had food poisoning,” said Keenan, 58. “I managed to go back to sleep but woke up four hours later and was covered in hives. I&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; sat up in bed and almost fainted just from sitting up, that’s how low my blood pressure was.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Keenan had gone into &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/anaphylaxis-allergic-reaction-symptoms-what-to-do-b29qt9fnq" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;anaphylactic shock&lt;/a&gt;. He quickly took an antihistamine, rushed to the local hospital and underwent a series of blood tests. Days later the cause of the mystery illness was confirmed: he had alpha-gal syndrome, a life-threatening allergy to red meats and most dairy products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Hundreds of people in Martha’s Vineyard, a large island south of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, are living with this rare condition, which can be caused by a single bite from the lone star tick. It has transformed this exclusive, carefree summer spot into a place where residents practise veganism — not because they want to, but because they have to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="5.3"&gt;&lt;div id="5203a86b-6caf-450a-9b83-c2571760308d"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;An educational display used by Patrick Roden-Reynolds, a biologist who surveys tick populations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;EYEVINE/ELIZABETH CECIL/THE NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Sufferers cannot eat any food products that contains alpha-gal, a sugar molecule carried by the lone star tick and which is present in all mammals — except humans and some monkeys. This means cheeses, milk and meats from beef to venison are all off the menu. For some, even white sugar cannot be tolerated because it is processed using animal-bone char.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Alpha-gal symptoms including hives, stomach cramps, vomiting and breathlessness often start to appear several hours after eating foods containing the molecule, giving the syndrome its nickname “the midnight allergy”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/lyme-disease-symptoms-serena-williams-alexis-ohainan-dltvc9pcb" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lyme disease: the ‘yuppie virus’ with dangerous false diagnoses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Such is the prevalence of the syndrome in Martha’s Vineyard that local restaurants and bakeries have introduced “alpha-gal-friendly” menu options, while grocery stores are selling more plant-based ice creams, cheeses and meats than ever before. Sufferers have set up an alpha-gal support group and regularly share advice on social media on how to avoid being bitten. Others have started to shun dining out, fearing they might fall ill from a slab of butter or a stray piece of cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="5.9"&gt;&lt;div id="971c5b45-d60c-48c8-9b32-7e8676b6de1e"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Alpha-gal-friendly foods at the North Tabor Farm Stand in Martha’s Vineyard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;EYEVINE/ELIZABETH CECIL/THE NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I’m on a Martha’s Vineyard Facebook group and it’s a constant conversation,” said Megan DeLisle, the general manager of the Black Dog restaurant in Edgartown. “People are talking about it all the time. They get a &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/growth-of-tick-diseases-blamed-on-climate-change-and-rewilding-jsgfxrv60" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;tick bite&lt;/a&gt; and they’re scared, asking for advice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Her restaurant, she said, now offers an “alpha-gal entree” to cope with the demand, adding: “We’ll have local people come in and they’ll absolutely ask for alpha-gal entrees. No dairy, nothing with mammals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The lone star tick, an eight-legged arachnid no bigger than a shirt button, was first found on Martha’s Vineyard in 1985 but has become more established in recent years, feeding and breeding on the thousands of deer that roam the island’s lush woods and beach grass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This is reflected in the rising number of alpha-gal diagnoses. Some 523 new cases were reported on Martha’s Vineyard last year out of 1,254 tests for the allergy, according to data from the island’s main hospital. In 2020, just two out of nine samples tested positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Keenan, a telecoms repairman who thinks he first developed the syndrome after stepping in a cluster of ticks in 2019, was the second person on the island to be diagnosed with alpha-gal, he said. At that time, none of the local doctors knew what they were dealing with. He said: “They were taking pictures. I was a case study. But they’re pretty good now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;But whenever he ventures off the island, nobody is aware of the condition. “I went to the mainland for some dental work and told the doctor what I had but he and no one in his office had ever heard of it. That’s seven miles away from where I’m sitting right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/363dd094-5a6d-418c-a2bc-c31bbbf34610" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Climate change could trigger boom in tick population&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Keenan said he used to feel faint from the fumes released by a BBQ. “I’m a little better now,” he adds. Even so, he said his symptoms — diarrhoea, cramps and itching — can last days at a time whenever he accidentally eats something he shouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In the most severe cases, anaphylactic shock can develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Alpha-gal can be life-threatening for some,” said Patrick Roden-Reynolds, a biologist who leads the island’s &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/nhs-must-wake-up-to-the-serious-risks-of-lyme-disease-j8sf7n38r" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;tick-safety&lt;/a&gt; programme. “Others may only get mild symptoms like hives. Reactions can be very different for different people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Kate Sudarsky, a 26-year-old teacher on the island, is one of the luckier ones. She was diagnosed with alpha-gal in 2021 after Keenan, her godfather, encouraged her to get checked for a mystery rash that had been bothering her for nearly a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;But since her diagnosis she has never had an anaphylactic reaction, nor does she suffer from breathlessness — although she still carries an EpiPen with her. She said hives and an upset stomach are the worst of her symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The worst thing about the condition, she said, is how it’s reshaped her social life. She largely avoids BBQs and going out to dinner with friends because she cannot be sure that butter or white sugar hasn’t been used in the food she eats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="5.26"&gt;&lt;div id="0d9020fb-d7e1-4f0e-a0e6-51184c9178ac"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Diners in Martha’s Vineyard are increasingly wary of ingredients due to developing alpha-gal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“It has had a huge impact on me,” she said. “I just can’t trust that a lot of places are able to accommodate my allergies. Or going over to somebody’s house for a potluck or a BBQ, you don’t want to be the social pariah asking people, ‘Is this vegan? What about that?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Sudarsky said that she missed cheese the most, as well as being able to grab a slice of pizza with her friends. Vegan cheese, she added, “is not good in any regard”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Although the prevalence of alpha-gal syndrome on Martha’s Vineyard has rocketed in recent years, the island is “definitely not the worst off”, said Roden-Reynolds. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that the Midwest has the highest rates per capita, and the agency estimates that about 450,000 people are living with the disease in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/a31df34e-67df-42f0-a6a0-b428ff641b27" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Darrell Currie: Doctors treated me like a guinea pig, so I tried something new&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Yet experts fear the situation on Martha’s Vineyard is only going to get worse due to the island’s growing &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/venison-deer-foodbanks-perthshire-jtsgr7xsr" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;deer population&lt;/a&gt;. Roden-Reynolds said there are anywhere from 55 to 75 deer per square mile — up from 40 to 60 in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This is up to ten times the amount of deer needed for a healthy forest ecosystem, he said, adding: “Each deer this time of year probably has a couple of hundred ticks on them that are attached and feeding and producing new ticks for the next year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Locals have called for an increase in deer hunting to manage the island’s population. “Even doing some sort of hunting tourism-promotion thing here would be helpful in a way,” said Sudarsky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Others have said that more accurate labelling is needed for food and medicines to indicate whether it’s “alpha-gal friendly”. Keenan said he had been prescribed drugs in the past only to find out through the manufacturer’s website that it contained an inactive ingredient he could not consume. He said: “I’m not sure why the hospital’s pharmacist or the doctors can’t provide that information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;While there is no treatment for alpha-gal, people’s allergic reactivity can wane over time, and some are able to successfully reintroduce dairy, red meat and other mammalian products into their diets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;That day has yet to come for Keenan.

And while they bring the relief of cool air, these contraptions also create the conditions for dangerous bacteria to multiply and spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One particularly nasty bacteria-borne illness is currently spreading in New York City using those enormous cooling units as its vector: Legionnaire’s disease. The bacterial pneumonia, which usually recurs each summer in the US’s largest city, &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/legionnaires-disease.page"&gt;has sickened&lt;/a&gt; more than 100 people and killed &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/19/us-news/fifth-person-dies-in-legionnaires-disease-outbreak-in-harlem-as-cases-rise-to-108/"&gt;five&lt;/a&gt; in a growing outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you don’t live in New York City or the Northeast, you may never have heard of Legionnaire’s, but this niche public health threat may not be niche for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Climate change is helping to make Legionnaire’s disease both more plentiful in the places where it already exists and creating the potential for it to move to new places where the population may not be accustomed to it. Cities in the Northeast and Midwest, where hotter weather meets older infrastructure, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/php/surveillance/index.html"&gt;have reported more cases&lt;/a&gt; in recent years. Recently, Legionella bacteria was &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/legionella-bacteria-found-water-system-dearborn-allegria-village/"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; in a nursing home’s water system in Dearborn, Michigan — one of the states, along with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/health-depts/surv-reporting/2018-19-surv-report-508.pdf"&gt;Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, that have &lt;a href="https://www.msms.org/About-MSMS/News-Media/michigan-experiencing-increase-in-legionnaires-disease"&gt;seen more activity in the past few years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Anyone can contract Legionnaire’s disease by inhaling tiny drops containing the bacteria, and the symptoms — fever, headache, shortness of breath — appear within days. It can cause a severe lung infection, with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/hcp/clinical-signs/index.html#:~:text=Hospitalization%20is%20common.,fatality%20rate%20is%20extremely%20low."&gt;a death rate of around 10 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While healthier people often experience few symptoms, the more vulnerable — young children, the elderly, pregnant people, and those with compromised immune systems — face serious danger from the illness. Around 5,000 people die every year in the United States from Legionnaire’s disease, &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/08/06/legionnaires-disease-nyc-outbreak-ac/85531559007/"&gt;many of them&lt;/a&gt; living in low-income housing with outdated cooling equipment where the bacteria can more readily grow and spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Legionnaire’s disease is a microcosm of climate change’s impact on low-income communities. As warmer temperatures facilitate the spread of disease, the most socially vulnerable populations are going to pay the steepest price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-collision-of-legionnaires-disease-climate-change-and-economic-disparities" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The collision of Legionnaire’s disease, climate change, and economic disparities&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Legionnaire’s disease was first &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC358030/"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; after an unusually aggressive pneumonia outbreak during an American Legion conference in Philadelphia in 1976. Soon, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists confirmed the cause of the mysterious illness: a previously unknown bacteria that was accordingly named Legionella. Legionella, unfortunately, is everywhere — in streams, lakes, and water pipes across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But usually, it occurs in such low concentrations and is so remote that it doesn’t pose a threat to humans. &lt;em&gt;Usually. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Now, city health officials have found the bacteria in the large cooling tanks that serve massive apartment buildings across New York City, particularly in Harlem. Cooling tanks are ideal for Legionnaire’s to grow and spread. They’re filled with stagnant, warm water that is more hospitable to bacterial growth. Like an evaporative cooler, the systems convert warm stagnant water into cool air for apartment dwellers. They can spray mists laden with the bacteria into the open air, dispersing it across the surrounding air, where it can enter a person’s lungs when they inhale. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2014-08/documents/climate_and_microbial_iaq.pdf"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt;, 80 percent of Legionnaire’s cases are linked to potable water systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Summers have always been prime time for the spread of Legionnaire’s, and climate change only exacerbates all of these problems. For starters, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31519664/"&gt;the quality of natural water is degrading&lt;/a&gt; — creating &lt;a href="https://www.iwcinnovations.com/blog/environmental-factors-contributing-to-legionella-growth/"&gt;more favorable conditions for Legionella&lt;/a&gt;, which loves acidic water and low oxygen levels, to multiply — as the planet warms. In the summer, the higher the temperatures and the more humid the air, the easier it is for the bacteria to reproduce in these cooling systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A decade ago, researchers &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4450703/"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; that “climate change might increase the incidence of legionellosis through increased reliance on air conditioning systems,” especially the large units serving city housing buildings. The European Climate and Health Observatory &lt;a href="https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/observatory/evidence/health-effects/water-and-food-borne-diseases/legionnaires-disease-factsheet"&gt;advised&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 that higher temperatures and the increased rainfall associated with climate change could soon make Legionnaire’s disease a more widespread issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The EPA also &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2014-08/documents/climate_and_microbial_iaq.pdf"&gt;expects&lt;/a&gt; the bacteria’s range to expand as global temperatures rise. Each heat wave and heavy rainstorm creates the hot and wet conditions that allow Legionella to thrive. Flooding can allow Legionella-tainted water to more easily penetrate a community’s water system, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And those who live in a low-income area are more likely to be at risk from this increased prevalence of Legionnaire’s disease. As the New York Times &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/06/nyregion/legionnaires-disease-outbreak-harlem-new-york.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;reported recently&lt;/a&gt;, poorly maintained cooling systems are more likely to see Legionella flourish and pump the bacteria into their neighborhoods — and low-income housing is more likely to be poorly maintained. Though NYC attempted to require more inspections for defective cooling systems after a 2015 outbreak of Legionnaire’s, inspections have fallen off in recent years, according to reporting from &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/why-so-many-legionnaires-cases-in-ny-environmental-and-human-factors-may-play-a-role"&gt;The Gothamist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This dynamic isn’t unique to Legionnaire’s disease. As the EPA has &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/climateimpacts/climate-change-and-health-socially-vulnerable-people"&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt;, low-income people are more likely to face health consequences from climate change because they are more likely to live in places exposed to extreme weather, they are more likely to have health conditions that make them more vulnerable to infectious diseases and natural disasters — and they are more likely to live with the kind of aging infrastructure that allows Legionnaire’s to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-you-can-do-to-protect-yourself" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What you can do to protect yourself&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Legionnaire’s is a particularly disconcerting health threat: It rains down from the sky in tiny invisible droplets, packed with bacteria so potent it can kill one in 10 people whom it manages to infect through its telltale aggressive pneumonia. It is as deadly as &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis#:~:text=A%20total%20of%201.25%20million,lives%20since%20the%20year%202000."&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt;, though Legionnaire’s disease usually kills much faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I asked some experts what people can do about Legionnaire’s disease. The most important advice was to be vigilant about any public health warnings if you reside in an area where Legionella has historically lived or has recently been detected, especially if you have certain preexisting conditions like diabetes, chronic lung disease, or autoimmune disorders, or if you’re over the age of 50. Follow the news and make sure you’re registered for alerts from your local public health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;People could consider investing in a high-quality water filter during an outbreak, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/control-legionella/php/toolkit/potable-water-systems-module.html"&gt;the CDC says&lt;/a&gt;. If you use an evaporative cooler or your home is equipped with a swamp cooler, you can make sure you’re keeping them clean and using filtered water, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But the issue here is ultimately not your small humidifier. The problem resides much further up the water supply chain, in the massive community water systems where Legionella flourish. You can’t suddenly stop drinking water or breathing air, of course, even if there is a local outbreak. The CDC itself notes that point-of-use water filters only provide limited protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So, whenever you know Legionnaire’s disease is spreading nearby, you should be paying attention to your body, said &lt;a href="https://legionella.org/about/the-team/janet-e-stout-phd/"&gt;Janet Stout&lt;/a&gt;, president and director of the Special Pathogens Laboratory, who has studied the disease for 30 years. See your doctor immediately if you’re experiencing fever, shortness of breath, or a cough. You could have a special test done for Legionnaire’s disease and potentially receive antibiotics, such as Levofloxacin or Azithromycin, that have proven effective against the bacteria. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17750-legionnaires-disease"&gt;Most cases can be cured&lt;/a&gt; if they are caught early enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But this is a truly &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; health challenge; when bacteria are multiplying in community water systems and then spewing into the open air, anyone can be exposed. There is only so much that any one person’s own, individual effort can do to stop infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The main way to prevent Legionnaire’s disease, however, or at least significantly reduce its risk is by staying on top of maintenance to make sure community water sources are kept clean, preventing the bacteria from proliferating. But that kind of maintenance requires vigilance and perhaps even public pressure. In New York City, for example, only 1,200 cooling towers &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/15/us-news/harlemites-outraged-they-were-kept-in-dark-about-deadly-nyc-legionnaires-disease-outbreak-tied-to-city-owned-buildings-irresponsible/"&gt;were inspected in the first six months of 2025&lt;/a&gt;, a steep drop-off from 2017 when the city had checked more than 5,000 over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;Landlords and public health authorities must take Legionnaire’s disease seriously. We are going to see more and more outbreaks as climate change continues to heat the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 10:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

Science&lt;/a&gt; has linked the presence of two compounds (one of which is found in green tea) to the restoration of a molecule that fuels our brain cells’ production of energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might compounds in green tea help to protect against dementia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at the levels of guanosine triphosphate (GTP), an energy molecule in brain cells, in older Alzheimer’s model mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;They wanted to investigate this because, study author Professor Gregory Bower &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-08-vitamin-b3-green-tea-compound.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="said"

data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, “As people age, their brains show a decline in neuronal energy levels, which limits the ability to remove unwanted proteins and damaged components.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these unwanted proteins may include amyloid plaque proteins, the accumulation of which in the brain is thought to lead to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After treating affected neurons for just 24 hours, the reserachers found that a combination of nicotinamide (a type of vitamin B3) and epigallocatechin gallate, an antioxidant found in green tea, seemed to restore GTP levels back to those seen in younger cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once those cells’ GTP levels increased, benefits (including more efficient clearing of amyloid plaque proteins) followed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Bower shared: “We found that restoring energy levels helps neurons regain this critical cleanup function”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does this mean drinking more green tea will definitely help to reduce dementia risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, partly because the way that the antioxidants present in green tea were administered was very

rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. But there’s one surprising biological change that researchers are just starting to uncover, thanks to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study, which was published in the &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022227525001270" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of Lipid Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Lipid Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, found that people with Alzheimer’s disease experience a breakdown in the ability to shuttle cholesterol to the neurons in their brain, and that this symptom is linked to a certain genetic variant called APOE4, which carries a known risk for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This biological discovery could potentially pave the way for a better understanding of the disease and even future disease prevention methods. Here’s what you need to know about the science so far, with input from a neurologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the expert&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil, DO;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Clifford Segil, DO&lt;/a&gt;, is a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the researchers find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed the cerebrospinal fluid (the biological liquid that surrounds and cushions the brain and spinal cord) from 10 patients with Alzheimer’s disease and compared it to the cerebrospinal fluid of 10 people who did not have the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;They discovered that lipoproteins (round particles made of fat and protein) in the cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer's patients were less effective at delivering cholesterol to neurons, or nerve cells, which are responsible for transmitting information from the brain throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is cholesterol? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cholesterol is an essential, waxy, fat-like molecule that your body needs for good health, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/blood-cholesterol" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Heart Lung and Blood Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Heart Lung and Blood Institute&lt;/a&gt; (NHLBI). Cholesterol is carried around your body by two types of lipoproteins: low-density lipoproteins (a.k.a. LDL or “bad” cholesterol) and high-density lipoproteins (a.k.a. HDL or “good” cholesterol).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;High levels of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64894213/how-to-improve-cardiovasular-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:LDL cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; can cause a buildup of fatty deposits called plaque in your arteries, raising the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other health complications, per the NHLBI. But high levels of good HDL cholesterol may lower the risk for certain health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it important for brain function?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While it has a bad rap in the health world, cholesterol is actually really important for your proper brain function. Your brain is the most &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197018623001638" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197018623001638" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:-rich organ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;-rich organ&lt;/a&gt; in your body. Specifically, cholesterol helps make up cell membranes, including those in nerve cells, and plays a crucial role in your neurons' ability to "talk" to each other and transmit information. When cholesterol levels are out of balance, it can impact that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs12276-024-01273-4&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65821905%2Fcholesterol-alzheimers-link-apoe4-study%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:transmission of essential information;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;transmission of essential information&lt;/a&gt; between nerve cells, leading to cognitive issues that are seen with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. Cholesterol is also a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/165/4/bqae032/7631422" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:building block;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;building block&lt;/a&gt; for steroid hormones, which support brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, that doesn't mean more cholesterol is always good for your brain. High levels of LDL cholesterol are usually considered a modifiable risk factor for ischemic stroke, or “clogged pipes” in the brain, explains Clifford Segil, DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There is less research and understanding on the possible benefits of cholesterol found in spinal fluid including HDL, which we classically identify as the ‘good cholesterol,’” Dr. Segil says. “We know high levels of certain types of cholesterol cause strokes and we are less clear in the year 2025 about the benefits of cholesterol in brain function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this link back to Alzheimer’s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This particular study noted that cholesterol found in lipoproteins were different in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, but Dr. Segil says that there is a “complicated” relationship between lipids and protein in the brain. “Some researchers continue to assign memory loss symptoms in patients with Alzheimer’s due to abnormal brain protein levels and this paper noted lipid brain levels may also be abnormal,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Segil points out that neurologists commonly prescribe medications called statins to lower levels of cholesterol and the risk of stroke. Lowering levels of LDL cholesterol can decrease the risk of developing certain type of dementia, including vascular dementia, he says. But it’s not clear if it may do more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Further research will determine if lowering your cholesterol will result in lower chances of getting Alzheimer’s dementia,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxNV1ptLW1FQzA3S2h1M2Itb1ZVYVBXX2RHamdEY081UmZPVHJNdWV1cjhLUENIY3RSb1ZwcjBTUUs5YjZqWmo2LUVJZkFFNVo5NTF4d2RDSldFUk1uOTh1TmpkbFNXNmk0SkREajRrUE0xQnZiamV4MVZoaGw3WC1LODVSQTFhUQ</guid></item><item><title>这个男人想让你知道疫苗的真相- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOb1A5MVBuVzl3WnM1d3hrd25lUkxnWjdvdU9CWUFrMkxDSGYzYnExNHBMdU05cHhudTZKcHJtZEFWNmlnT3BOY1AzZFBSWGlTV3BBdmZuekxObnlKVFN1TFZkdno2NnFvbGZxS0UtU3FGQ2V2bjlWWEFLM3I3WFE2MWRaRFPSAYoBQVVfeXFMTU1tNUhfXzcwalZoN0kwNGI2U0hYS3I1WGtuTEdzUEtBZHNlQXhudl91TkZfYVFrVy1IRVM2NDAzWnBaOV8wdkFVV1EzWmVURXVBQ3VHSy1VZlprVTlFTnpZcklRM0lxbF83R2hpcDdvQVVfeGdlanJOdGJ2VkQ4YU0tQjU2eTNxWkJ3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Dr. Jake Scott is on the front line of his second pandemic in five years and he is not getting much sleep.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ow000i2e6da8900uoo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott works full-time as an infectious disease physician at Stanford Health Care’s Tri-Valley hospital in Pleasanton, California. When he is done taking care of his patients and his two grade-school aged kids, he often stays up past midnight writing — furiously penning op-eds, collecting studies, leading evidence reviews and posting meaty threads on social media, most of them correcting the record on vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000j2e6dydyaeg8b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Often, he’s reacting to the latest maneuvers by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.. A &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1933356758355042607" target="_blank"&gt;pinned post&lt;/a&gt; responding to one of Kennedy’s appearances on Fox News has been viewed almost 5 million times. Another &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1951503868812206475" target="_blank"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; fact-checking Kennedy’s claims about potential harms from aluminum in vaccines had 1 million views in its first 48 hours. Scott’s followers on X have doubled since April.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000k2e6dzslngey5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A million views for this long-winded, very detailed, kind of nerdy breakdown of the science,” Scott said, marveling at the attention it got. “I think that’s saying something, you know? People want that information, and they deserve it,” said Scott who is 48.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000l2e6d2u9taka5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Covid-19 pandemic turned many infectious disease specialists and virologists into household names. Scott’s was not one of them, perhaps because he was too busy treating patients.  He didn’t stay out of the public discourse completely, however. He was one of the first doctors to tell people that Omicron didn’t seem to be as severe an infection as earlier strains of the virus, although&lt;a href="https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-952/" target="_blank"&gt; some virologists &lt;/a&gt;were skeptical at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik79s5002z2e6dler3ri5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In President Donald Trump’s second administration, however, Scott is taking on what he sees as a second pandemic —  misinformation and disinformation about vaccines. He knows false information can be as harmful as any virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000m2e6d9z5tugla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When officials spread inaccurate information about vaccines, it does have real consequences, and families make decisions based on fear rather than on facts,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmejcer27000k2e6esl5pahb1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s already happening. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported data showing kindergarten vaccination rates &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/31/health/vaccination-school-requirements-cdc"&gt;continue to decline&lt;/a&gt;, as states make it easier to opt out of school vaccination requirements. Vaccine preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/05/health/measles-cases-us-record-since-elimination"&gt;are rising again, too&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmejdnqwh000b3b6qlkh8czar@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott knows it could get much worse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000n2e6d5twv5ko7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In 2021, nearly every single patient I lost to Covid was unvaccinated by choice, and every colleague of mine has said the same thing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmeik3qfo002r2e6dm8nkudiy@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="a-pandemic-within-a-pandemic" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        A pandemic within a pandemic
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000p2e6d3qpwem4e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For Scott, the fight to restore trust in vaccines is deeply personal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000q2e6duehy81qv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2020, he found himself in the crosshairs of Covid-19, treating a deluge of patients —many of them young and healthy — for a lethal new virus that was eating up their lungs, clotting their blood and causing catastrophic immune reactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;







    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000r2e6d8c2ugbaq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the beginning, they had nothing to stop it. No tests, no treatments, and certainly nothing to prevent it. He worked all day, every day during the week and every other weekend in full personal protective equipment. He says he lost dozens of patients in the span of a few months. He kept track of the numbers for a while, but then stopped counting when the deaths became so frequent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000s2e6dwjsk4kac@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We tried so hard,” Scott said in an interview with CNN. “Despite fighting for my patients with a hundred percent dedication, I lost so many people.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000t2e6dhxxjkjrx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then, in late December, 2020, it felt like a miracle happened — the Covid-19 vaccine. Operation Warp Speed had delivered what Trump had promised: a safe and highly effective vaccine in less than a year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000u2e6dszmf8u48@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I can’t emphasize enough how dramatic that change was once the vaccines became available,” Scott said. “I did see it firsthand, and it was mind-blowing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000v2e6din97i9nu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Within weeks, a Covid diagnosis was no longer a death sentence — at least, for the vaccinated. Even his most fragile patients, elderly people living in nursing homes, stopped dying. And then, as the vaccine became widely available, Scott’s crushing patient load lightened.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000w2e6d6hy7fcjw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But even as science was finally making inroads against Covid, a second problem arose, a phenomenon the World Health Organization identified as &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/infodemic#tab=tab_1" target="_blank"&gt;an infodemic&lt;/a&gt;—the flood of information, much of it false, that occurs during a disease outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000x2e6dqp561bpl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We had these two parallel pandemics. We had the Covid pandemic, and then the pandemic of, you know, the infodemic misinformation,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000y2e6d4tu36khx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While Covid is no longer a public health emergency, Scott said, the country never effectively dealt with the disinformation pandemic, and we’re paying for it now.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000z2e6d5argtrtx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He believes misinformation, more than almost anything else, explains our current political moment, and “it’s only getting worse,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00102e6dmnei2re0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’ve seen what happens when people avoid vaccines because of misinformation, and it’s absolutely heartbreaking,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00112e6drq3jpsfk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott has made it his mission to take on misstatements and distortions about vaccines, especially when they come from &lt;a href="https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, a longtime anti-vaccine activist who Trump installed as his Secretary of Health and Human Services earlier this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00122e6dh5g33y7m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He is doing it at a time when many others are afraid to speak up for fear of making themselves or their institutions targets of the Trump administration’s lawsuits and funding cuts, and when anti-vaccine rhetoric and demonization of scientists has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/12/us/cdc-atlanta-shooting-shots-windows"&gt;inspired violence&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00132e6dfgjh8nkt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m not afraid,” Scott said.  “Stanford stands behind me.  I have amazing support.”
    &lt;/p&gt;





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeixuj7q00003b6qnc7qhi0u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy has maintained that he is not anti-vaccine and that he is a proponent of vaccine safety. But Kennedy’s HHS has already made &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/08/health/video/rfk-jr-vaccines-overhaul-digvid"&gt;sweeping changes&lt;/a&gt; to US vaccine infrastructure and policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00142e6d217tgma6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott says he has not heard directly from Kennedy, but he does get comments from his supporters. Some have called Scott “brainwashed” and a “pharma shill” or accused him of being “a fake doctor.” (The University of Vermont confirmed Scott graduated from medical school there in 2011, and he has an active medical license in California.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00162e6dse1e7s9a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott said he gets a salary from Stanford to treat patients and teach, but he’s mostly working to correct the record on vaccines on his own dime. The government’s Open Payments database — where drug companies have to report payments to physicians — shows Scott received a single payment between 2018 and 2024, a $13 payment reported by the drug company Janssen in 2022. Scott thinks he must have eaten a group lunch somewhere and didn’t realize it was sponsored.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00172e6df27lxrpo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott’s writing and advocacy recently caught the attention of Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Osterholm tapped him to be a senior reviewer of evidence for the Covid, flu and RSV vaccines for the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/health/covid-vaccine-recommendation-aap"&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a group of outside public health experts that has been independently reviewing data on vaccines out of concern for vaccine misinformation and access under current federal health leadership.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmej5mc1600083b6qvodwtvml@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott cancelled a planned vacation to jump in to help and was among the scientists who presented the group’s findings &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSuvGlxqrpg" target="_blank"&gt;live on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00182e6dx38cb7iq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He has an uncanny way of taking complicated issues and distilling them down into readable, understandable pieces of information,” Osterholm said.  “He has what I consider to be almost limitless energy.  He’s really a very hard worker.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00192e6d63tanomj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He is a real professional star,” Osterholm said, “But personally, he’s just, he’s a very kind and thoughtful individual.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I work with a number of colleagues, even now, who never had a job until they became doctors,” Scott said, “And you can kind of tell. They’re still great doctors, but it’s just a different perspective.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001c2e6d6gttf02h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott got his first paying job at age 11, an off-the-books gig at A Bicycle Odyssey, a bike shop in Sausalito, California, frequented by the likes of Robin Williams, members of the band The Grateful Dead and Huey Lewis. He said the owner paid him $2.50 an hour to organize bike shoes. Eventually, he graduated to lacing the spokes on bike wheels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001d2e6dq0x31mu1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott said he didn’t save much because he poured all his earnings back into the shop.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001e2e6dlxyonz5f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Becoming a doctor was never something he imagined he could do.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001f2e6dgnuh8j5p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His parents were hippies, Scott said. They bought a fishing shack in Sausalito, one of the few properties that had its own beach, and over years of living there turned it into a two-story house.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001g2e6dle69a5oq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott’s parents were well-known and liked in Sausalito. They started a July 4 parade in town. His father was on the local school board and often walked around town with a parrot on his shoulder. He owned a business that distributed the print edition of The New York Times around the San Francisco Bay area.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001j2e6d3zwft4f1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Both our kids have worked all their lives. They had no choice,” said Scott’s father, Marvin.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001h2e6dvei6l3t0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After Scott’s stint at the bike shop, he went to work at a surf shack at age 14, a hobby that became another passion. For college, he followed his older sister to the University of California at Santa Cruz because there was good surfing near the campus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001i2e6dttomh1bf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the first two years, he said he dabbled in different interests, including environmental studies. Realizing he didn’t know what he wanted to do with his life, and not wanting to waste money on tuition, he took a year off from school and worked roofing and construction jobs.  For a while, he said, he lived in the woods behind the campus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001k2e6dn5ln1flk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The hard, physical labor of construction convinced him to return to school.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001l2e6dm5k4kud6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I wanted to use my brain, not my back,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001m2e6dm8pz7a0k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He began writing poems and short stories and applied to the literature program. He got in and graduated with a writing degree.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001n2e6d3l4n18n6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After gradulation he worked odd jobs and traveled.  He taught English in Japan, but nothing seemed to stick or turn into a career.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001o2e6dyyza91uh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When he came back to the US, a friend recruited him to work at Planned Parenthood. He worked as a medical assistant — talking to patients, often guiding them through the most difficult times in their lives — and became an HIV testing counselor. He discovered he had a talent for it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001p2e6d0q4qcepb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A lot of clients were surprised when they when they found that their medical assistant was a man,” Scott said.  “But I think that that really taught me to try to sort of be disarming and not judgmental and not intimidating, and to be empathetic.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001q2e6dy8lei7ta@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He volunteered at San Francisco General Hospital and worked in the Tenderloin, a part of the city that’s had a reputation for drug use, crime, and homelessness, helping with needle exchange programs for people with substance use disorders.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001r2e6dvfd9u7es@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He fell in love with medicine,” Marvin Scott said of his son.
    &lt;/p&gt;





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001s2e6d8jfmgxut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The experience at Planned Parenthood made him think about becoming a doctor, even though it was never a dream he’d had for himself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001t2e6dgtfmqwxs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was a pretty gutsy thing to do at that stage in his life,” said Scott’s dad, Marvin. His parents gave their blessing — as long as he paid for it himself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001u2e6dbb1uhfli@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There was just one problem: Scott hadn’t taken any pre-med classes in college. The only biology class he took in college was an intro to marine biology called “Life Under the Sea.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001v2e6diulscr76@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He enrolled in a two-year program at Mills College, traditionally a women’s college, for graduates who wanted to go to medical school.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001w2e6dcyyu4tgf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I worked so hard,” Scott said. The school’s library closed at midnight, and Scott says he was usually there when they were locking up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001x2e6d4w3t7t7z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I had sort-of avoided science and math growing up.  I was just this free-spirited kid and young adult,” Scott said.  “I didn’t know whether I had what it takes to be a doctor.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001y2e6dlibxsynh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As he was completing his studies at Mills, he ran the gauntlet of med school admissions, applying to dozens of schools and flying around the country for interviews. He was accepted to the University of Vermont and started medical school at age 30.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001z2e6dmmbhja5i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think my sort of secret weapon is that I have a lot of self-discipline. And I don’t think of myself as the smartest by any means, but I do have a pretty, pretty insane work ethic,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00202e6doligfsff@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After two years of learning anatomy and taking classes exams in medical school, Scott spent two years shadowing country doctors in Maine and Vermont, sometimes making house calls to see patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00212e6duj07t7d8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of them, a doctor known to be a tough evaluator, later wrote Scott a recommendation saying that not only was he well-informed and great with patients, but “He’s got soul.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00222e6dk15165po@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That just meant so much to me,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00242e6dvotsq1dr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a medical resident — essentially a junior doctor — at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Oakland, Scott got to try out different specialties.  One of his first rotations was infectious disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00252e6d7vqimjqd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His first patient — a wealthy, older White man — was gravely ill in the intensive care unit. His case had stumped his doctors.  He was anemic, with high fevers and a high heart rate.  He had all the symptoms of malaria, but none of the risk factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00262e6d3768ufl2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The infectious disease team was called in to consult on the case. The doctor who was training Scott thought of a disease that mimics malaria, called &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/17/health/babesiosis-tick-disease-northeast"&gt;Babesiosis&lt;/a&gt;. It’s caused by a parasite that infects red blood cells through the bite of a tick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00272e6d8457g133@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the ticks in California, where the man lived, don’t commonly carry Babesia. The infection was more widespread in New England.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00282e6dto0vv08j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The doctor asked the man’s wife if they had been there recently.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00292e6d8402p61r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sure enough, a week before he came in, they had spent the summer on Long Island,” Scott said. They checked the patient’s blood under a microscope. The cells were teeming with parasites.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002a2e6dwfwqxnoj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “She made the diagnosis by asking this one question,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002b2e6dwiukqpk5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Infectious disease seemed like the perfect combination of Scott’s academic interests —medicine and storytelling. If you could understand a patient’s story, oftentimes, you could make a diagnosis. Scott was hooked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002c2e6d54421q0v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He got his dream job at Stanford, one of the &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/united-states/infectious-diseases" target="_blank"&gt;best infectious disease programs&lt;/a&gt; in the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002d2e6dj5pqvwj0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then it was 2020, and his dream job became a nightmare.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002e2e6d3ys6vhyq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just can’t emphasize enough how devastating 2020 was,” Scott said. He watched people die of a virus, then watched others die because they couldn’t separate facts from fiction and were too scared to get a vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002f2e6dsk6jh6tt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He remembers treating a family of three, all unvaccinated, and all three got severe Covid. None had any significant underlying medical conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeje0o4x000d3b6qpuan2x31@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The father told Scott that he’d rather be shot in the head than get the Covid-19 vaccine. The mother didn’t survive her infection. When the son woke up in the ICU, he learned she had died.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002h2e6docpmca6o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was one of the worst things I’ve ever experienced,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002i2e6d3zhed2sq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I saw her as a victim of inaccurate information,” Scott said. “I remember seeing family members crying outside of the hospital, and they were holding bags with her belongings, and it absolutely broke my heart.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002j2e6dczq7ix1f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So he’s staying up at nights working late, hoping to save others from the same fate:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002k2e6d3np7gx6f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No, children don’t get 92 shots by the time they’re 18, &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1933356762306130021" target="_blank"&gt;he explained recently on X&lt;/a&gt;. Even if you count annual flu shots, it’s about 48 to 51.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002l2e6drox9l1r2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yes, we do know the safety profiles of vaccines, &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1933356765992943997" target="_blank"&gt;he shared in another post&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmej56yei00053b6qacfn79aa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No, the people who made recommendations about vaccines to the CDC — before they were dismissed by Kennedy — don’t have rampant conflicts of interest, &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1933356760557027684" target="_blank"&gt;he detailed in another post&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002o2e6dvtm3juow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In that way, he hopes to inoculate people against disinformation, one fact at a time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNN</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOb1A5MVBuVzl3WnM1d3hrd25lUkxnWjdvdU9CWUFrMkxDSGYzYnExNHBMdU05cHhudTZKcHJtZEFWNmlnT3BOY1AzZFBSWGlTV3BBdmZuekxObnlKVFN1TFZkdno2NnFvbGZxS0UtU3FGQ2V2bjlWWEFLM3I3WFE2MWRaRFPSAYoBQVVfeXFMTU1tNUhfXzcwalZoN0kwNGI2U0hYS3I1WGtuTEdzUEtBZHNlQXhudl91TkZfYVFrVy1IRVM2NDAzWnBaOV8wdkFVV1EzWmVURXVBQ3VHSy1VZlprVTlFTnpZcklRM0lxbF83R2hpcDdvQVVfeGdlanJOdGJ2VkQ4YU0tQjU2eTNxWkJ3</guid></item><item><title>这个男人想让你知道疫苗的真相- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOb1A5MVBuVzl3WnM1d3hrd25lUkxnWjdvdU9CWUFrMkxDSGYzYnExNHBMdU05cHhudTZKcHJtZEFWNmlnT3BOY1AzZFBSWGlTV3BBdmZuekxObnlKVFN1TFZkdno2NnFvbGZxS0UtU3FGQ2V2bjlWWEFLM3I3WFE2MWRaRFM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Dr. Jake Scott is on the front line of his second pandemic in five years and he is not getting much sleep.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ow000i2e6da8900uoo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott works full-time as an infectious disease physician at Stanford Health Care’s Tri-Valley hospital in Pleasanton, California. When he is done taking care of his patients and his two grade-school aged kids, he often stays up past midnight writing — furiously penning op-eds, collecting studies, leading evidence reviews and posting meaty threads on social media, most of them correcting the record on vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000j2e6dydyaeg8b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Often, he’s reacting to the latest maneuvers by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.. A &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1933356758355042607" target="_blank"&gt;pinned post&lt;/a&gt; responding to one of Kennedy’s appearances on Fox News has been viewed almost 5 million times. Another &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1951503868812206475" target="_blank"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; fact-checking Kennedy’s claims about potential harms from aluminum in vaccines had 1 million views in its first 48 hours. Scott’s followers on X have doubled since April.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000k2e6dzslngey5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A million views for this long-winded, very detailed, kind of nerdy breakdown of the science,” Scott said, marveling at the attention it got. “I think that’s saying something, you know? People want that information, and they deserve it,” said Scott who is 48.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000l2e6d2u9taka5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Covid-19 pandemic turned many infectious disease specialists and virologists into household names. Scott’s was not one of them, perhaps because he was too busy treating patients.  He didn’t stay out of the public discourse completely, however. He was one of the first doctors to tell people that Omicron didn’t seem to be as severe an infection as earlier strains of the virus, although&lt;a href="https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-952/" target="_blank"&gt; some virologists &lt;/a&gt;were skeptical at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik79s5002z2e6dler3ri5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In President Donald Trump’s second administration, however, Scott is taking on what he sees as a second pandemic —  misinformation and disinformation about vaccines. He knows false information can be as harmful as any virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000m2e6d9z5tugla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When officials spread inaccurate information about vaccines, it does have real consequences, and families make decisions based on fear rather than on facts,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmejcer27000k2e6esl5pahb1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s already happening. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported data showing kindergarten vaccination rates &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/31/health/vaccination-school-requirements-cdc"&gt;continue to decline&lt;/a&gt;, as states make it easier to opt out of school vaccination requirements. Vaccine preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/05/health/measles-cases-us-record-since-elimination"&gt;are rising again, too&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmejdnqwh000b3b6qlkh8czar@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott knows it could get much worse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000n2e6d5twv5ko7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In 2021, nearly every single patient I lost to Covid was unvaccinated by choice, and every colleague of mine has said the same thing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmeik3qfo002r2e6dm8nkudiy@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="a-pandemic-within-a-pandemic" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        A pandemic within a pandemic
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000p2e6d3qpwem4e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For Scott, the fight to restore trust in vaccines is deeply personal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000q2e6duehy81qv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2020, he found himself in the crosshairs of Covid-19, treating a deluge of patients —many of them young and healthy — for a lethal new virus that was eating up their lungs, clotting their blood and causing catastrophic immune reactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;







    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000r2e6d8c2ugbaq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the beginning, they had nothing to stop it. No tests, no treatments, and certainly nothing to prevent it. He worked all day, every day during the week and every other weekend in full personal protective equipment. He says he lost dozens of patients in the span of a few months. He kept track of the numbers for a while, but then stopped counting when the deaths became so frequent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000s2e6dwjsk4kac@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We tried so hard,” Scott said in an interview with CNN. “Despite fighting for my patients with a hundred percent dedication, I lost so many people.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000t2e6dhxxjkjrx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then, in late December, 2020, it felt like a miracle happened — the Covid-19 vaccine. Operation Warp Speed had delivered what Trump had promised: a safe and highly effective vaccine in less than a year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000u2e6dszmf8u48@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I can’t emphasize enough how dramatic that change was once the vaccines became available,” Scott said. “I did see it firsthand, and it was mind-blowing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000v2e6din97i9nu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Within weeks, a Covid diagnosis was no longer a death sentence — at least, for the vaccinated. Even his most fragile patients, elderly people living in nursing homes, stopped dying. And then, as the vaccine became widely available, Scott’s crushing patient load lightened.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000w2e6d6hy7fcjw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But even as science was finally making inroads against Covid, a second problem arose, a phenomenon the World Health Organization identified as &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/infodemic#tab=tab_1" target="_blank"&gt;an infodemic&lt;/a&gt;—the flood of information, much of it false, that occurs during a disease outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000x2e6dqp561bpl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We had these two parallel pandemics. We had the Covid pandemic, and then the pandemic of, you know, the infodemic misinformation,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000y2e6d4tu36khx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While Covid is no longer a public health emergency, Scott said, the country never effectively dealt with the disinformation pandemic, and we’re paying for it now.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000z2e6d5argtrtx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He believes misinformation, more than almost anything else, explains our current political moment, and “it’s only getting worse,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00102e6dmnei2re0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’ve seen what happens when people avoid vaccines because of misinformation, and it’s absolutely heartbreaking,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00112e6drq3jpsfk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott has made it his mission to take on misstatements and distortions about vaccines, especially when they come from &lt;a href="https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, a longtime anti-vaccine activist who Trump installed as his Secretary of Health and Human Services earlier this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00122e6dh5g33y7m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He is doing it at a time when many others are afraid to speak up for fear of making themselves or their institutions targets of the Trump administration’s lawsuits and funding cuts, and when anti-vaccine rhetoric and demonization of scientists has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/12/us/cdc-atlanta-shooting-shots-windows"&gt;inspired violence&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00132e6dfgjh8nkt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m not afraid,” Scott said.  “Stanford stands behind me.  I have amazing support.”
    &lt;/p&gt;





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeixuj7q00003b6qnc7qhi0u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy has maintained that he is not anti-vaccine and that he is a proponent of vaccine safety. But Kennedy’s HHS has already made &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/08/health/video/rfk-jr-vaccines-overhaul-digvid"&gt;sweeping changes&lt;/a&gt; to US vaccine infrastructure and policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00142e6d217tgma6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott says he has not heard directly from Kennedy, but he does get comments from his supporters. Some have called Scott “brainwashed” and a “pharma shill” or accused him of being “a fake doctor.” (The University of Vermont confirmed Scott graduated from medical school there in 2011, and he has an active medical license in California.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00162e6dse1e7s9a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott said he gets a salary from Stanford to treat patients and teach, but he’s mostly working to correct the record on vaccines on his own dime. The government’s Open Payments database — where drug companies have to report payments to physicians — shows Scott received a single payment between 2018 and 2024, a $13 payment reported by the drug company Janssen in 2022. Scott thinks he must have eaten a group lunch somewhere and didn’t realize it was sponsored.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00172e6df27lxrpo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott’s writing and advocacy recently caught the attention of Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Osterholm tapped him to be a senior reviewer of evidence for the Covid, flu and RSV vaccines for the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/health/covid-vaccine-recommendation-aap"&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a group of outside public health experts that has been independently reviewing data on vaccines out of concern for vaccine misinformation and access under current federal health leadership.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmej5mc1600083b6qvodwtvml@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott cancelled a planned vacation to jump in to help and was among the scientists who presented the group’s findings &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSuvGlxqrpg" target="_blank"&gt;live on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00182e6dx38cb7iq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He has an uncanny way of taking complicated issues and distilling them down into readable, understandable pieces of information,” Osterholm said.  “He has what I consider to be almost limitless energy.  He’s really a very hard worker.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00192e6d63tanomj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He is a real professional star,” Osterholm said, “But personally, he’s just, he’s a very kind and thoughtful individual.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001b2e6d2jrhbn2g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I work with a number of colleagues, even now, who never had a job until they became doctors,” Scott said, “And you can kind of tell. They’re still great doctors, but it’s just a different perspective.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001c2e6d6gttf02h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott got his first paying job at age 11, an off-the-books gig at A Bicycle Odyssey, a bike shop in Sausalito, California, frequented by the likes of Robin Williams, members of the band The Grateful Dead and Huey Lewis. He said the owner paid him $2.50 an hour to organize bike shoes. Eventually, he graduated to lacing the spokes on bike wheels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001d2e6dq0x31mu1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott said he didn’t save much because he poured all his earnings back into the shop.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001e2e6dlxyonz5f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Becoming a doctor was never something he imagined he could do.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001f2e6dgnuh8j5p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His parents were hippies, Scott said. They bought a fishing shack in Sausalito, one of the few properties that had its own beach, and over years of living there turned it into a two-story house.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001g2e6dle69a5oq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott’s parents were well-known and liked in Sausalito. They started a July 4 parade in town. His father was on the local school board and often walked around town with a parrot on his shoulder. He owned a business that distributed the print edition of The New York Times around the San Francisco Bay area.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001j2e6d3zwft4f1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Both our kids have worked all their lives. They had no choice,” said Scott’s father, Marvin.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001h2e6dvei6l3t0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After Scott’s stint at the bike shop, he went to work at a surf shack at age 14, a hobby that became another passion. For college, he followed his older sister to the University of California at Santa Cruz because there was good surfing near the campus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001i2e6dttomh1bf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the first two years, he said he dabbled in different interests, including environmental studies. Realizing he didn’t know what he wanted to do with his life, and not wanting to waste money on tuition, he took a year off from school and worked roofing and construction jobs.  For a while, he said, he lived in the woods behind the campus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001k2e6dn5ln1flk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The hard, physical labor of construction convinced him to return to school.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001l2e6dm5k4kud6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I wanted to use my brain, not my back,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001m2e6dm8pz7a0k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He began writing poems and short stories and applied to the literature program. He got in and graduated with a writing degree.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001n2e6d3l4n18n6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After gradulation he worked odd jobs and traveled.  He taught English in Japan, but nothing seemed to stick or turn into a career.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001o2e6dyyza91uh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When he came back to the US, a friend recruited him to work at Planned Parenthood. He worked as a medical assistant — talking to patients, often guiding them through the most difficult times in their lives — and became an HIV testing counselor. He discovered he had a talent for it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001p2e6d0q4qcepb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A lot of clients were surprised when they when they found that their medical assistant was a man,” Scott said.  “But I think that that really taught me to try to sort of be disarming and not judgmental and not intimidating, and to be empathetic.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001q2e6dy8lei7ta@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He volunteered at San Francisco General Hospital and worked in the Tenderloin, a part of the city that’s had a reputation for drug use, crime, and homelessness, helping with needle exchange programs for people with substance use disorders.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001r2e6dvfd9u7es@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He fell in love with medicine,” Marvin Scott said of his son.
    &lt;/p&gt;





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001s2e6d8jfmgxut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The experience at Planned Parenthood made him think about becoming a doctor, even though it was never a dream he’d had for himself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001t2e6dgtfmqwxs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was a pretty gutsy thing to do at that stage in his life,” said Scott’s dad, Marvin. His parents gave their blessing — as long as he paid for it himself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001u2e6dbb1uhfli@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There was just one problem: Scott hadn’t taken any pre-med classes in college. The only biology class he took in college was an intro to marine biology called “Life Under the Sea.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001v2e6diulscr76@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He enrolled in a two-year program at Mills College, traditionally a women’s college, for graduates who wanted to go to medical school.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001w2e6dcyyu4tgf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I worked so hard,” Scott said. The school’s library closed at midnight, and Scott says he was usually there when they were locking up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001x2e6d4w3t7t7z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I had sort-of avoided science and math growing up.  I was just this free-spirited kid and young adult,” Scott said.  “I didn’t know whether I had what it takes to be a doctor.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001y2e6dlibxsynh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As he was completing his studies at Mills, he ran the gauntlet of med school admissions, applying to dozens of schools and flying around the country for interviews. He was accepted to the University of Vermont and started medical school at age 30.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001z2e6dmmbhja5i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think my sort of secret weapon is that I have a lot of self-discipline. And I don’t think of myself as the smartest by any means, but I do have a pretty, pretty insane work ethic,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00202e6doligfsff@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After two years of learning anatomy and taking classes exams in medical school, Scott spent two years shadowing country doctors in Maine and Vermont, sometimes making house calls to see patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00212e6duj07t7d8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of them, a doctor known to be a tough evaluator, later wrote Scott a recommendation saying that not only was he well-informed and great with patients, but “He’s got soul.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00222e6dk15165po@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That just meant so much to me,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00242e6dvotsq1dr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a medical resident — essentially a junior doctor — at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Oakland, Scott got to try out different specialties.  One of his first rotations was infectious disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00252e6d7vqimjqd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His first patient — a wealthy, older White man — was gravely ill in the intensive care unit. His case had stumped his doctors.  He was anemic, with high fevers and a high heart rate.  He had all the symptoms of malaria, but none of the risk factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00262e6d3768ufl2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The infectious disease team was called in to consult on the case. The doctor who was training Scott thought of a disease that mimics malaria, called &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/17/health/babesiosis-tick-disease-northeast"&gt;Babesiosis&lt;/a&gt;. It’s caused by a parasite that infects red blood cells through the bite of a tick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00272e6d8457g133@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the ticks in California, where the man lived, don’t commonly carry Babesia. The infection was more widespread in New England.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00282e6dto0vv08j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The doctor asked the man’s wife if they had been there recently.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00292e6d8402p61r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sure enough, a week before he came in, they had spent the summer on Long Island,” Scott said. They checked the patient’s blood under a microscope. The cells were teeming with parasites.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002a2e6dwfwqxnoj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “She made the diagnosis by asking this one question,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002b2e6dwiukqpk5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Infectious disease seemed like the perfect combination of Scott’s academic interests —medicine and storytelling. If you could understand a patient’s story, oftentimes, you could make a diagnosis. Scott was hooked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002c2e6d54421q0v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He got his dream job at Stanford, one of the &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/united-states/infectious-diseases" target="_blank"&gt;best infectious disease programs&lt;/a&gt; in the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002d2e6dj5pqvwj0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then it was 2020, and his dream job became a nightmare.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002e2e6d3ys6vhyq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just can’t emphasize enough how devastating 2020 was,” Scott said. He watched people die of a virus, then watched others die because they couldn’t separate facts from fiction and were too scared to get a vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002f2e6dsk6jh6tt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He remembers treating a family of three, all unvaccinated, and all three got severe Covid. None had any significant underlying medical conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The father told Scott that he’d rather be shot in the head than get the Covid-19 vaccine. The mother didn’t survive her infection. When the son woke up in the ICU, he learned she had died.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It was one of the worst things I’ve ever experienced,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I saw her as a victim of inaccurate information,” Scott said. “I remember seeing family members crying outside of the hospital, and they were holding bags with her belongings, and it absolutely broke my heart.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            So he’s staying up at nights working late, hoping to save others from the same fate:

            No, the people who made recommendations about vaccines to the CDC — before they were dismissed by Kennedy — don’t have rampant conflicts of interest, &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1933356760557027684" target="_blank"&gt;he detailed in another post&lt;/a&gt;.

            In that way, he hopes to inoculate people against disinformation, one fact at a time.

you're likely to experience with Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But for women who claim to be experiencing 'Ozempic vulva', these sound like a walk in the park in comparison &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/ozempic-side-effects-women-vulva-news-828013-20250819"&gt;to what they're dealing with&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Numerous females who have been using the GLP-1 medications for weight loss purposes have complained that this side effect has now started to cause them aggravation on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Although Ozempic vulva isn't an official medical term and is not a recognised side effect by manufacturers Novo Nordisk, a &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/us-news"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;-based physician explained that loads of women have been complaining of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr Michael Tahery &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.drtahery.com/ozempic-vagina-what-are-the-side-effects-of-semaglutide"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; that weight loss drugs can impact the vulva and vagina in three ways - causing sagging of the outer labia, weakness of the vaginal muscles, and vaginal dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As those consuming weight loss drugs often shed the pounds rapidly, this can cause their skin to sag...and unfortunately ladies, the vulva is not immune to this either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"It may result in visible sagging of the labia or vagina because of overall fat and volume loss," Dr Tahery said. "This sagging is caused by loose labia loose skin in the vaginal area, wrinkles, or some combination of all three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"It’s also common for rapid weight loss to cause the labia to suddenly feel out of proportion compared to how it previously felt."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The latter part of that sentence has hit the nail on the head for a number of ladies who have been complaining about Ozempic vulva and everything that comes with it on &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/reddit"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;One woman shared a post explaining that she wanted to know if she was the only one who was left feeling seriously out of sorts by the change in appearance of their private parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"I have lost 30% of my starting weight and obviously have had a significant change in body shape,' she said. "One of the weirder side effects is that I am far more aware of my labia now, not in a sexual way, but just in a being aware of a body part I was not previously very aware of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;'Ozempic vulva' has been causing chaos for some ladies (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"I am not a prudish person by nature, but it is sometimes to the point where I feel uncomfortable about it. I wonder if it's to do with the size of my upper thighs, actually - that there used to be a lot more cushion and now there is a gap? Anyway, it's weird and probably the thing I least expected to occur."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;This ended up sparking quite the mother's meeting about how their protruding labia's were seriously getting in the way, how people are struggling to adapt to it and &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/ozempic-side-effects-females-vulva-women-097174-20250818"&gt;how it can impact your sex life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;One person said: "Yep.

I'm very confused and getting used to this new way of life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A third added: "Mine's gone saggy," while a fourth commented: "I can't feel my wee coming out anymore, what is that?!?!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In a statement, Novo Nordisk told LADbible that 'patient safety is of the utmost importance to' the pharmaceutical firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"We continuously collect safety data on our marketed GLP-1 RA medicines and work closely with the authorities to ensure patient safety," it said.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="34" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme8p48y0003ykvktg78px6rx@published"&gt;About 3 million Americans die every year. Compared with other rich countries, we die at an alarmingly higher rate: One-quarter of those deaths wouldn’t have occurred if America were only as deadly as its peers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0cpo000k3b79ro42jerr@published"&gt;Zoom in, and things get even more concerning: Among Americans younger than 65, almost half of deaths wouldn’t happen if we had a death rate that matched our peers. Among those aged 25 to 44, a group we call “early adults,” it’s 62 percent—nearly two out of three deaths at those early ages.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0csc000l3b79u93k4zdb@published"&gt;We’re mortality experts, and these facts stem from &lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.1118"&gt;an analysis we did&lt;/a&gt; of death rates in 22 countries from 1980 through 2023 (the last year with reliable data). When we set out to do this research, we expected to find a story about the COVID-19 pandemic. America’s pandemic experience was much worse than that of our peers, with three U.S. deaths for every two in peer countries. Nonelderly Americans in particular were hit harder than nonelderly populations in other rich countries. This disadvantage only grew as vaccinations became available but were adopted by Americans at lower rates.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0cuu000m3b79jg7i4jwq@published"&gt;But what surprised us was that, from today’s postpandemic vantage point, the American health disadvantage &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; look like a pandemic story at all. The U.S. mortality disadvantage has been growing at about the same rate for years, and while it spiked during COVID-19, it still continues to rise.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0cya000n3b79bc9nwgyz@published"&gt;Here’s another way to put this: In 2023 there were about 700,000 “missing Americans”—those who died in 2023 but would be alive if they had lived somewhere else. And that 700,000 is almost exactly the number that we could’ve predicted back in 2019, based solely on prepandemic trends. COVID and relatively low vaccine adoption are a problem for Americans. But our country seems to be, at a deeper level, a deadly place to live. What’s more, all of the studies we have (with some limited exceptions, like a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2836256"&gt;study specific to California&lt;/a&gt;) stop before Donald Trump began his second term with enormous cuts to medical and health research and, now, to Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0d1j000o3b791106vxt1@published"&gt;There is a heated—and productive—debate about exactly why the U.S. is so much worse than our peers at keeping its populace alive. One influential theory focuses on deindustrialization and the way that Americans without a college degree in particular have been left behind. Another focuses on the way that social safety nets in this country, such as for unemployment, sickness, and pensions, remain small and insufficient compared with other wealthy countries. Others point to problems in the U.S. health care system, such as uninsurance, underinsurance, and high co-payments and deductibles, and to underlying trends in chronic diseases that might be caused by nutritional policy failures. Still others highlight America’s permissive gun laws and the large amount of time we spend in our cars.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="19" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0d78000p3b793t5pd0yw@published"&gt;These theories, which aren’t mutually exclusive, all predate COVID-19 and offer plausible explanations for the growing U.S. mortality disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0d9x000q3b79670yam7a@published"&gt;But our research also uncovered one population for whom the pandemic does look like a longer-term turning point for the worse. And that population is a worrisome one: Americans early in their adulthood, those aged 25 to 44—that is, millennials, as well as some older members of Gen Z .&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0ddh000r3b799ujnlqt0@published"&gt;Before 2010, the estimated lifespan for American early adults increased every year. Deaths from HIV and cancer were plummeting. Homicides had fallen dramatically, and fatalities from circulatory disease, a major cause of death at every adult age, were also falling in this age group. But sometime after 2010, for almost every cause of death, this changed. Early adults proved especially susceptible to drug overdose deaths as synthetic fentanyl swept the country, but also became increasingly likely to die in car collisions and from digestive diseases and diabetes, and stopped making much progress in death rates from circulatory disease.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0dgp000s3b790a8ux7nu@published"&gt;Just as for other adult age groups, when COVID-19 arrived in 2020 and 2021, mortality increased markedly among early adults. Alongside COVID-19 deaths were major increases in deaths from drug overdose, transportation, alcohol, homicide, circulatory disease, suicide, and other causes, as the country’s social structures and health system buckled under the stress of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0dk8000t3b79kucgo8cx@published"&gt;But when older adults’ death rates plummeted after the pandemic, early adults lost only a little over half of the additional deaths that the pandemic years had brought. Before the pandemic, early adults’ mortality trends closely mirrored other adult age groups. Since COVID-19, their increased mortality is unique.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0dni000u3b79hmzx07t8@published"&gt;The result of all this? By 2023, American early adults’ chance of dying was 70 percent higher than it would have been had the lifesaving trends of the early 2000s continued. And this leaves them 2.6 times as likely to die as early adults in other rich countries. Amid declining economic prospects and future optimism among younger American adults, perhaps no statistic more starkly captures the disadvantage of entering adulthood in the U.S. today.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0dqr000v3b79kwqi56lk@published"&gt;We don’t know exactly why this is happening. Some changes related to the pandemic seem relatively obvious: employment loss and insecurity that disproportionately impacted younger workers, increased alcohol consumption and drug use, and coincided with high rates of depression that continued to distinctly affect early adults following the peak pandemic. This age group experienced hardships during COVID-19 that are difficult to bounce back from.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="32" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0dvv000w3b79itl0x2i2@published"&gt;But the fact that death rates have remained high across so many &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of deaths, from car collisions to fatalities from circulatory diseases and diabetes, hints at more encompassing and systemic problems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="42" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0dym000x3b79w2epwcj6@published"&gt;People who are 25 to 44 have experienced major turning points in this country’s history: The oldest of them were Reagan babies who launched their careers in the shadow of the Great Recession, and the youngest entered adulthood during a worldwide pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0e28000y3b7971895xgp@published"&gt;In the 2028 election, millennial and Gen Z voters will account for half of the U.S. electorate. Many of these early adults are disillusioned with a political and economic system that does not provide living wages, stable employment, housing security, or affordable health care. As social mobility in the U.S. has decreased, the prospect of homeownership and marriage has also become unattainable for many early adults, regardless of how hard they work. And now millennial and Gen Z Americans are far more likely to die than their age peers in other rich nations.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0e4s000z3b7903podtn9@published"&gt;These economic and health inequities are likely to further increase with cuts to the country’s social safety net, including to programs such as Medicaid, to pay for tax cuts for high earners. Technological advancements may lead to widening income inequality if stable jobs are replaced by A.I. Investing in millennials and Gen Z should be a top policy priority. Politicians looking to win votes would do well to make it a key part of their campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

We believe that this may result in what we call early vascular ageing, meaning that your blood vessels are older than your chronological age and you are more susceptible to heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If that is happening, we need to identify who is at risk at an early stage to prevent heart attacks and strokes." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study tested nearly 2,500 people from across the world, categorising them based on whether they had Covid and whether they had been hospitalised for it, both in a general ward and in an intensive care unit. Tests were taken six months after an infection and again after 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It measured each person’s vascular age with a device that examines how quickly a wave of blood pressure travels between the artery in the neck and the legs. The higher the measurement meant the stiffer the blood vessels, indicating a higher vascular age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dbflQO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/19/09/AMN-MED_EEUU-COVID-VACUNAS_54229.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/19/09/AMN-MED_EEUU-COVID-VACUNAS_54229.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/19/09/AMN-MED_EEUU-COVID-VACUNAS_54229.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Vaccinated individuals show less stiffening in their arteries and stabilised symptoms over time" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-17594"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Vaccinated individuals show less stiffening in their arteries and stabilised symptoms over time&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (AP)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It found that all three groups of patients who had a Covid infection had stiffer arteries compared to those who hadn’t been affected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average increase in women was 0.55 meters per second for those who had mild Covid, 0.60 for those who had been hospitalised, and 1.09 for those in intensive care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to researchers, an increase of around 0.5 meters per second is "clinically relevant" and equivalent to ageing around five years. It also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, like heart attack, stroke or sudden cardiac arrest, in 60-year-old women by 3 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between men and women could come down to immune systems, Prof Bruno added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said: “Women mount a more rapid and robust immune response, which can protect them from infection. However, this same response can also increase damage to blood vessels after the initial infection.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the virus acts on specific receptors in the body that are in the lining of the blood vessels. The virus will use these receptors to enter and infect cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, it was reported that a &lt;a href="/news/uk/home-news/new-covid-strain-stratus-xfg-symptoms-b2785299.html"&gt;new strain of Covid &lt;/a&gt;had spread across the UK, accounting for the highest proportion of cases - around 30 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts warned the Stratus strain was resisting immunity and had a unique symptom of giving people a &lt;a href="/news/uk/home-news/covid-symptoms-2025-stratus-new-variant-strain-xfg-b2805973.html"&gt;hoarse voice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 09:43:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQWUw2TnRxUWphNDV4aXk5T09XVnpGY2JSd0o3SkUyeEFfUUpiYnVHaS1VNVNqbThhNERUMk9EU0hIMm9Vb0RDdmxDT1hoYXc0QllmN2RHYmRHNm5RRWQxQXFiZlRfOUdyZnFvdXVWekU4LVdfNlVjRk12b204RGF2TUcwcU1ZNkNFcmwxU0gtbkVHTUVGUFlaZklLczdEWkY0N3JIa1hGdw</guid></item><item><title>突破性的新型癌症检测技术用钻石传感器取代放射性示踪剂--《独立报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQX1hkSFJuYjA4MnhLMERHSWNfZzVvd1B4LVJuLVJNWWFZc3k1WFp1R2lLY2Z3YXhleEowX196Tkt0QnpuNjh0dTJBRW90MXVxeDExaVotMEtxVmJfWFlMbVg5cHZld185VExILXlWOHp6UFNyQ3BUc2VMRXcwbUlZc2UxYjVoS2xqa0wtTFNWMXdJUVFYZlQyYVVFTjFvOXNCOUl4VE9UWnY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gryCYY sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 dmMyEN"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 fXvmgM"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 hJPJVF"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 lcJUSj"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 laZbyn"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 cKWiEj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

have created a handheld device that is designed to trace tiny magnetic particles injected into the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists said this offers a non-toxic alternative to radioactive tracers and dyes currently used in hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metastasis, when cancer cells spread from the original &lt;a href="/topic/tumour"&gt;tumour&lt;/a&gt; to other parts of the body, is one of the most serious challenges in cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors often rely on tests to see whether the cancer has reached the lymph nodes – the areas of tissue that filter fluid in your body for harmful substances – which can guide decisions about surgery and further care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Physical Review Applied&lt;/em&gt;, describe how &lt;a href="/topic/diamonds"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt; can be used to build a highly sensitive sensor capable of identifying the magnetic tracer fluid injected into a tumour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fluid, made up of iron oxide nanoparticles, travels through the body alongside cancer cells, revealing whether they have reached the lymph nodes, the researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dfrwcF"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/19/13/07/img_5344.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/19/13/07/img_5344.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=1008%2C0%2C1008%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/19/13/07/img_5344.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=1008%2C0%2C1008%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The findings, published in Physical Review Applied, describe how diamonds can be used to build a highly sensitive sensor capable of identifying the magnetic tracer fluid injected into a tumour" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-32030"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;The findings, published in Physical Review Applied, describe how diamonds can be used to build a highly sensitive sensor capable of identifying the magnetic tracer fluid injected into a tumour&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Karishma Gokani/University of Warwick)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Alex Newman, a PhD student in Warwick University’s physics department, said the new tool could improve the way doctors find cancer in keyhole and endoscopic surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a real demand for versatile non-toxic means of finding cancer,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For this new diamond-based sensor, we managed to get the size of the sensor head down to just 10 millimetres, which means it is the first diamond sensor to be able to detect magnetic tracer fluid while being small enough for endoscopic use and keyhole surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Newman added that the device was extremely sensitive, capable of detecting just one hundredth of the typical dose of magnetic tracer fluid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design uses a diamond measuring only half a cubic millimetre alongside a small permanent magnet, the scientists said &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They added that this compact structure means there is no need for bulky electronics, allowing the sensor to be used by hand in operating rooms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Gavin Morley, who leads the research group, said the breakthrough was possible thanks to nitrogen vacancy centres inside the diamond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These allow the diamond to detect very small changes in the magnetic field and give the diamonds a lovely pink colour,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that the technology could also have uses beyond medicine, including in spacecraft and fusion power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current techniques for tracing cancer cells rely on radioactive tracers, which not all hospitals can access, or blue dyes, which trigger allergic reactions in some patients, the researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians involved in this new project believe the new diamond sensor could help avoid these complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stuart Robertson, a consultant breast cancer surgeon at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire, said he was already using magnetic localisation in his work. He added that it offers more advantages over traditional techniques. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers say the device could eventually be applied to various cancers, including lung, liver, colorectal and oesophageal tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 09:40:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQX1hkSFJuYjA4MnhLMERHSWNfZzVvd1B4LVJuLVJNWWFZc3k1WFp1R2lLY2Z3YXhleEowX196Tkt0QnpuNjh0dTJBRW90MXVxeDExaVotMEtxVmJfWFlMbVg5cHZld185VExILXlWOHp6UFNyQ3BUc2VMRXcwbUlZc2UxYjVoS2xqa0wtTFNWMXdJUVFYZlQyYVVFTjFvOXNCOUl4VE9UWnY</guid></item><item><title>拥有面部触手的“弗兰肯斯坦”兔子现在对人类构成威胁-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxOY3p3REx6bmdwa1Z3V3pkLVBEaTlQUWs3SXBnNkdUWjhiX1ZwSzl6SFp2VWkxaEhnMFZkZWxhSVlwQUxBY256R3pneVplX0NkeDFjUG5jYi0yZXRleHpRbnlyWXQweF9tZTBfNl94dHBiX0JzMHdGV0xEMjRxS3BLZWxObUlsUmFFb29xYVRLU3k0cG80Yl91V0tlWlNEZ0NUdUlJY3I3Yw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More 'Frankenstein' rabbits are appearing across the US, sparking fears of a wider outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Originally spotted in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/colorado/index.html" id="mol-04ed05f0-7d30-11f0-a204-61761bab1ede"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, these bizarre rabbits, with tentacle-like growths sprouting from their faces, have now been reported in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/minnesota/index.html" id="mol-04ef9e00-7d30-11f0-a204-61761bab1ede" class="class"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nebraska/index.html" id="mol-04f01330-7d30-11f0-a204-61761bab1ede" class="class"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/south-dakota/index.html" id="mol-04f14bb0-7d30-11f0-a204-61761bab1ede" class="class"&gt;South Dakota&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The animals are infected with cottontail rabbit papilloma virus (CRPV), also known as Shope papilloma virus, which can be spread through mosquito and tick bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While humans are unlikely to contract CRPV, Dr Omer Awan of the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/maryland/index.html" id="mol-04ef01c0-7d30-11f0-a204-61761bab1ede" class="class"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; School of Medicine cautioned that people could still face risks from other diseases carried by ticks or mosquitoes that have fed on infected rabbits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You're not going to get CRPV, and you likely won't show symptoms of it,' Dr Awan told the Daily Mail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, you could still be indirectly exposed through ticks or mosquitoes that have fed on infected animals, which means you might contract a different disease.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Indeed, illnesses spread by disease-carrying pests to humans include Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, both spread by ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;West Nile Virus, Zika Virus, Dengue Fever and Chikungunya are all spread by mosquitoes and can be fatal in severe cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A Reddit user recently posted images of a rabbit in Shope papilloma virus in Saint Paul, Minnesota in late July&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A user on Reddit posted an image in 2024 of a rabbit in Fort Collins, Colorado exhibiting signs of Shope papilloma virus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Awan advised the best course of action is to avoid contact with infected rabbits and ensure any pet rabbits are protected from insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Awan also warned Americans should prepare for the possibility of seeing even more cases of this grotesque condition spreading beyond the Midwest in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'Because temperatures are becoming warmer, we're gonna start to see it become more prevalent as the years go on, and also to spread in areas where it hasn't been before,' Dr Awan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We have a series of states already in the Midwest, but perhaps it could go even more south in the United States, maybe Southwest as well. I do believe that this will become more of an increasing problem as time goes on,' he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Awan noted that it's 'extremely unlikely' that CRPV will eventually jump to humans, even as cases among rabbits grow, but he admitted that it's not completely impossible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You can never say never with science or with viruses, because they always mutate and things can change very fast, but I don't see that happening in the near future with CRPV,' the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest sightings posted on social media have moved north of Colorado, reaching several major cities in central Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a series of pictures posted to Reddit in late July, one person revealed that infected rabbits were now in Saint Paul. Others reported seeing them in Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We live in Plymouth, and our neighborhood bunnies have the same thing,' another Minnesota resident added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A video posted to X on August 18 captured a rabbit with its face covered in CRPV growths in Sioux Falls, South Dakota - nearly 500 miles from the sightings in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The virus is not thought to be painful unless the growths affect a rabbit's eyes or mouth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Another Reddit user captured images of a rabbit in Colorado (pictured) exhibiting the early stages of the disease spreading throughout the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first sign that a rabbit has the virus is red, raised spots on their skin that eventually turn into wart-like tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In many cases, these warts develop into keratinized papillomas, the 'horns' and 'tentacles' seen growing out of midwestern rabbits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, some of the warts can turn into a squamous cell carcinoma, a serious skin cancer that can be deadly if it spreads and isn't treated early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Awan noted that even if the warts don't turn cancerous, they can continue to grow for years and become a major vulnerability to rabbits in the wild. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What can happen is they can obstruct their vision, it can get close to their mouths, and it can prevent them from feeding properly, and they can even starve,' the medical expert explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For others, it can make them more vulnerable to predators. So, it can certainly do harm.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Awan claimed climate change was the driving force behind the widespread increase in sightings this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is the time when mosquitoes and ticks thrive in these warmer temperatures, so because they're able to thrive, they're able to infect more rabbits, and hence, we're getting more CRPV cases,' Dr Awan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it's not just cases of rabbit diseases that are going up. Cases of Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever in humans have risen in the US in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These temperature changes are resulting in diseases that were never endemic in certain areas to become endemic,' Dr Awan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you take a look at Lyme disease, for example, we're starting to see it in areas that we never saw it before... places like southern Canada, northern states on the East Coast, like Maine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Obesity drugs such as &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-3"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/NVO/"&gt;Novo Nordisk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'s Wegovy and &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-4"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/LLY/"&gt;Eli Lilly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'s Zepbound can also be difficult to access due to their high costs, limited U.S. insurance coverage and constrained supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, any patient can purchase a Signos membership to access its system. It uses an AI platform and an off-the-shelf continuous glucose monitor, or CGM, from &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-5"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/DXCM/"&gt;Dexcom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to offer personalized, real-time data and lifestyle recommendations for weight management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is now a solution that everybody can use to help on the weight loss journey, and you don't have to be a certain number of pounds to use it. It's available for the average American who needs it," said Sharam Fouladgar-Mercer, Signos' co-founder and CEO, in an interview on Tuesday ahead of the approval. "The average person might have five pounds to lose, or others might have 100 pounds to lose. We are here to help them at any point in that journey."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obesity epidemic costs the U.S. health-care system &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/php/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;more than $170 billion a year&lt;/a&gt;, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Almost 74% of Americans are overweight or obese, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm" target="_blank"&gt;government data&lt;/a&gt; says. Signos hopes it can make a "real big dent in that curve for the betterment of many of us," Fouladgar-Mercer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers who sign up for Signos can &lt;a href="https://store.signos.com/plan?c=fall20&amp;amp;amp;amp;_gl=1*7uhji3*_gcl_au*MTk0ODg5MDgwOS4xNjk3NDgwNDE2" target="_blank"&gt;choose&lt;/a&gt; a three-month or six-month plan, which currently costs $139 and $129, respectively. The company will ship out all of the CGMs a patient needs for the number of months in the plan they choose.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurers currently don't cover the system for weight management, but the plans are a fraction of the roughly $1,000 monthly price of GLP-1s in the U.S. Signos is working with health insurance companies and employers to get coverage for the system, the company said in a statement to CNBC. Signos said it expects "this to evolve quickly as interest for tackling weight continued to expand." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Signos system can be used in combination with GLP-1s or bariatric surgery, said Fouladgar-Mercer. He said patients can also use the system after getting off a GLP-1 to maintain their weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CGMs are small sensors worn on the upper arm that track glucose levels, mainly for people with diabetes. That data is wirelessly sent to Signos' app, which also allows patients to log their food intake and exercise levels, among other information that the AI platform uses to make recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from helping people lose pounds, the system aims to help users understand how their bodies respond to specific foods and exercise patterns and make the right behavioral changes to manage and maintain their weight in the long term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signos did not share how many patients are currently using its glucose monitoring system, but Fouladgar-Mercer said tens of thousands of people have already tried it over time. He said Signos has scaled up its CGM inventory and software capacity to "handle a pretty massive scale" following the approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 04:02:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNWUhhLVF4RTQ3ZWVfQ1lxbVpZSjNwVXVLNW9rMW5iZkpxaWlSMmo5SHdzZGl3UFdzaGt5ZTFxSTdxaVByblJVaFQ4VUF0ZWtjclBFSnc5akNFU294cVlhT2ZxSnUtT3lIQ20yWF83TEpoYzM1ajZvQVFsNEZESWJpQzB4QUtaamc4ZnFmN2hWZU5QZXVBTGfSAZsBQVVfeXFMTVB0SGJ1RDlLSF9FOTZsX2U3U0MtempzY1pPYmZTb0lBa1EwTFFGMldsdlFCMmxvenY5TERsNHE2bW5BWjVjbTNIVWNuV2ZEdnF6X3JfY3d1TTdkLW5pYm5pc29NVzlJU2hEQlY5OUNsUHRxM0Flb2lSMFd2T25UT1VfQk5KYzY4ZXktbm93TENjdFlXTHNxdVpoSXM</guid></item><item><title>一项为期30年的研究刚刚发现了您的薯条和糖尿病- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxONnN0bndBNmduM09xLThPRWNrTTVDQ1FBbl9NOWRTUkxjZm52cHRMa3lkaFpzMTN6ejk1VjVPTjRwazhERlBRUGt1c1RyLU1UN1lwVWU1Wjl4dFJWTjBtNUZKTGFGNFdRUlVBMU1LRXd6ak9TQ1dkVmJJeHplQnFJb2czcmhDN20zNUxuYkVvUXB2NVpPdUY3bVNn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 03:40:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxONnN0bndBNmduM09xLThPRWNrTTVDQ1FBbl9NOWRTUkxjZm52cHRMa3lkaFpzMTN6ejk1VjVPTjRwazhERlBRUGt1c1RyLU1UN1lwVWU1Wjl4dFJWTjBtNUZKTGFGNFdRUlVBMU1LRXd6ak9TQ1dkVmJJeHplQnFJb2czcmhDN20zNUxuYkVvUXB2NVpPdUY3bVNn</guid></item></channel></rss>
