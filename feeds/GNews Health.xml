    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Powerful federal advisers this week are expected to make a controversial change to how babies are immunized against hepatitis B, and to question how pediatricians inoculate children against more than a dozen other infectious diseases, including measles, mumps, whooping cough and polio.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (ACIP) is convening Thursday and Friday for a closely watched meeting to rethink fundamental elements of the childhood vaccination schedule, which has protected children from dangerous diseases for decades.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The potential changes are welcomed by allies of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long questioned the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We're now starting to see truth telling about vaccines, and needless to say, pharma, medicine, academia, mainstream media are not happy," Mary Holland of Children's Health Defense said &lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1996203075367743521" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in a video&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; posted to the group's social media page. The nonprofit advocates against vaccines and was co-founded by Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The meeting underscores grave concerns among many public health experts, who fear it will further erode childhood vaccinations, leading to a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We now seem to have entered a dangerous new phase in Secretary Kennedy's campaign to shut down scientific expertise, silence the best available evidence, and replace it with his own personal agenda," said Dr. &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/8599" target="_blank"&gt;Sean O'Leary&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Colorado Anschutz who chairs the American Academy of Pediatrics's committee on infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC's advisory committee, established in 1964, had long been considered a definitive source of information about childhood vaccines. It wields enormous power because its recommendations influence how doctors vaccinate patients and dictate whether insurance companies pay for shots.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the committee has lost the trust of most mainstream medical groups since Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/25/nx-s1-5438482/cdc-vaccine-committee-acip-meeting-rfk" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;replaced its members in June&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with his own slate. The committee has also abandoned longstanding collaborations with medical groups like the pediatrics academy and draws less on the experience of CDC experts.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The committee's September meeting devolved into chaos. A scheduled vote on the hepatitis B vaccine was tabled amid confusion. The chairman was&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/renowned-epidemiologist-and-biostatistician-martin-kulldorff-appointed-to-senior-hhs-role.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; replaced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week. The new chair, Dr. Kirk Milhoan, is a pediatric cardiologist and fellow with the Independent Medical Alliance – a group which continues to recommend treating COVID with drugs like ivermectin, even though studies have shown it does not work.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Confidence in the CDC was further eroded last month when the agency &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/20/nx-s1-5615040/cdc-rfk-childhood-vaccines-autism" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;changed its stance on whether vaccines may cause autism&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a theory championed by Kennedy and other anti-vaccine activists but long debunked by a large body of high-quality research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In response, many independent medical groups, such as the &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP-Immunization-Schedule.pdf?_gl=1*1uu9d3q*_ga*NTIyNjU3NDI2LjE3NTk0MzYyNjM.*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3NjQ3NzkxMDAkbzUkZzAkdDE3NjQ3NzkxMDAkajYwJGwwJGgw" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/family-physician/patient-care/prevention-wellness/immunizations-vaccines/immunization-schedules/birth-through-age-18-immunization-schedule.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Academy of Family Physicians&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a newly formed effort at the University of Minnesota called the &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vaccine Integrity Projec&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;t, have begun issuing independent recommendations, which some states have begun following instead.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Vaccine schedule under the microscope&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vaccine committee is expected to hear the first report by a new working group tasked with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html" target="_blank"&gt;scrutinizing the childhood vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt;. The schedule is the finely calibrated timetable pediatricians use to administer the sequence of more than 30 doses to protect against more than a dozen diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The scrutiny is especially troubling to many public health authorities, coming amid &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/12/nx-s1-5572507/us-measles-outbreaks-texas-south-carolina-utah-minnesota" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new outbreaks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of vaccine preventable diseases, which are on the rise because of falling immunization rates.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have seen more measles cases in our country this year than we have in recent history. In my own community, we're seeing quite significant upticks in pertussis," said Dr. Raynard Washington, director of the Mecklenburg County Public Health Department, based in Charlotte, N.C., "Any barriers [to vaccination] that might be created by bureaucracy or process pose a threat to the public's health."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccine proponents say every vaccine is carefully evaluated for safety and effectiveness before being added to the schedule. And researchers and regulators monitor all vaccines for safety issues after doctors start using them.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Children receive the roster of shots at a young age to make sure they don't catch dangerous diseases when they're most vulnerable, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Every vaccine on that schedule and the recommended timing of it exists for a reason," says pediatrician O'Leary. "It's based on the age at which a child's immune system can provide optimal protection after vaccination, balanced with the age when the child is at highest risk for a disease. There's no reason to delay or space out vaccines – doing so just puts children at risk."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some who are worried about vaccines argue the number of different antigens and other ingredients could overwhelm a child's immune system. But supporters say children are exposed to far more immune stimulation from naturally occurring microbes than from vaccines. And vaccines have been refined over the decades to minimize the number of ingredients they contain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Imagine saying we can only use medicines now that were developed before 1990," O'Leary says. "Imagine where we would be in medicine today. These newer vaccines are a good thing. They save lives. That's why we give them."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A change for the hepatitis B vaccine &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first concrete step expected from the committee is a vote to change the current recommendation that all babies get vaccinated against hepatitis B within the first 24 hours of life.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's unclear what the committee might recommend, but it could include delaying the shot or requiring a detailed discussion with parents before administering the shot.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Proponents of the change argue universal vaccination at birth is unnecessary because hepatitis B is often spread through sexual contact and drug use. Babies could be protected by increased screening of pregnant women and only inoculating babies of mothers who test positive, some argue. Supporters of the change also point to other countries that don't give newborns the dose.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But hepatitis B spreads other ways. The virus is highly infectious, and can be transmitted through contact with an infected person's body fluids, such as their blood. People can also get infected by coming into contact with common household objects, such as toothbrushes, and towels, that have been contaminated by another family member.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.24.25340907v1" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;A new analysis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by researchers who have presented at past ACIP meetings finds that delaying hepatitis B vaccination by just a few months could lead to more than $222 million in excess healthcare costs and hundreds of preventable deaths each year.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Most babies infected with the virus end up with chronic infections, which increases their risk for liver disease, failure and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Universal vaccination has been the cornerstone of hepatitis B elimination efforts for decades," says Eric Hall, assistant professor of epidemiology at Oregon Health and Science University, and a co-author on the analysis. "It's very important we continue this work and do not undo the important public health achievements of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5125a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;past 45 years&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Inoculating all babies at birth has resulted in a dramatic decrease in hepatitis B infections.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"The hepatitis B vaccine has one of the most well-established safety records of any vaccine, and it's one of our best," O'Leary says. "We've been using it for a long time. It's one of our best tools to protect babies from chronic illness and liver cancer. This is a situation where one missed case is too many."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He added that pediatricians partner with parents on children's health. "You probably will also hear a lot from individuals in this meeting who claim parents don't get a say in their children's immunizations," he said. "I want to be very clear when I say that's completely false. … We want to make sure we're protecting children from harmful diseases while also making sure the parents are fully informed and involved in the process."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In addition, proponents of universal hepatitis B vaccination at birth argue there is no evidence the current approach is unsafe. And delaying the first dose would cause major problems because the subsequent two doses are administered as part of combination vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Experts are also alarmed that the CDC is investigating splitting up the MMR vaccine, which protects kids against measles, mumps and rubella in one shot. Giving kids three separate shots would mean more trips to the doctor and more needles, vaccine proponents say. They worry that, inevitably, more kids would end up missing vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Aluminum ingredients under fire&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The committee is also studying the safety of an ingredient commonly used in vaccines, an additive that contains aluminum. Coming after other recent &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/06/nx-s1-5454890/vaccine-ingredient-thimerosal-cdc-acip" target="_blank"&gt;changes to vaccine policy&lt;/a&gt;, many public health experts worry that the administration may now try to remove the ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For almost a century, some important vaccines, including shots that protect against diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis and the flu, have included aluminum salts, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/adjuvants.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;compounds that contain small amounts of aluminum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They are used as adjuvants to give the immune system an extra boost to make the shots protective.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What aluminum does is it draws the immune system's attention to that particular little protein so that it makes a much more robust immune response that you then are protected by," O'Leary says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One question the working group is considering is "do either of the two different aluminum adjuvants increase the risk of asthma?" according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/child-schedule-tor-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; outlining the group's mandate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most public health experts say there's no good evidence that aluminum adjuvants are unsafe and ample evidence that they pose no real concern. In fact, a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40658954/" target="_blank"&gt;large Danish study &lt;/a&gt;recently debunked any danger. People are exposed to &lt;a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/tsp/phs/phs.aspx?phsid=1076&amp;amp;toxid=34" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;far more aluminum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on a daily basis from food, consumer products and their surrounding environment than from vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In addition to concerns over asthma, critics claim aluminum can&lt;a href="https://www.aluminiumresearchgroup.com/" target="_blank"&gt; also increase the risk for other health problems&lt;/a&gt;, including autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Based on large, long-term studies and immunology research, there is no evidence that vaccines cause either allergies or autoimmune disorders e.g., Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus," Dr. Frank Virant, president of the Board of Directors at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp;amp; Immunology, wrote in an email to NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But removing aluminum from vaccines would render them ineffective, and there are no substitute vaccines ready to go. It could take years to develop reformulated replacements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The country of Wales unintentionally produced one of those moments when a routine shingles vaccine – given only to people hitting a very narrow age window – appeared to protect long-term memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unexpected pattern caught the attention of &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford Medicine&lt;/a&gt; researchers, who combed through years of medical records and found something striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A follow-up study deepened the story, pointing toward viral reactivation, immune aging, and neuroinflammation as powerful – and often overlooked – forces in cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the findings suggest that a simple shingles shot may do far more for the aging brain than anyone expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-dormant-viruses-awaken"&gt;When dormant viruses awaken&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Varicella-zoster remains silent in nerve cells after childhood infection. Reactivation risk rises with age. Dementia research once focused on plaques and tangles alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New work highlights neuroinflammation as a major driver. Neurotropic herpesviruses can seed amyloid in mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human organoid work links viral activity with tau changes. Chronic viral stress may push immune pathways into harmful &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/where-you-live-may-affect-your-dementia-risk/"&gt;patterns&lt;/a&gt;. Reactivation pulses may degrade cognitive reserve over many years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wales introduced a live shingles vaccine with strict age rules. Only individuals aged exactly 79 in early autumn gained access for one year. Individuals just older lost access permanently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This narrow gap created two nearly identical groups. Corresponding author Pascal Geldsetzer explained a key concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All these associational studies suffer from the basic problem that people who go get vaccinated have different health &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dementia-is-a-growing-global-health-crisis-with-a-staggering-cost/"&gt;behaviors&lt;/a&gt; than those who don’t,” he said. The Welsh plan solved that concern through pure timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dementia-and-the-shingles-vaccine"&gt;Dementia and the shingles vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stanford Medicine tracked outcomes across seven years. Vaccinated individuals showed a 20 percent lower rate of dementia. A &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; paper expanded that pattern. Mild cognitive impairment fell in the vaccinated group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia-related deaths also dropped across nearly a decade. Evidence pointed to protection across the full disease path. Regression methods reduced confounding risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other intervention aligned with the exact birthdate rule. Consistent outcomes supported a causal interpretation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment signals early trouble in memory networks. The &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; study followed over 200,000 new cases. Vaccine eligibility lowered new diagnoses over a nine-year window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actual vaccine receipt lowered risk even more. Analyses held firm across many statistical checks. The age difference was only a few days, yet protection remained clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viral mechanisms likely shaped this early stage through reduced reactivation events. Reduced immune stress may preserve neural circuits in vulnerable regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vaccine-slowed-dementia"&gt;Vaccine slowed dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second group included individuals already living with dementia. Nearly half died from dementia causes over nine years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccinated individuals showed far fewer dementia-related deaths. Actual vaccine receipt dropped that risk by nearly one-third. Evidence again pointed to broad &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/one-particular-sleep-stage-slow-wave-deep-is-most-important-for-preventing-dementia/"&gt;protection&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most exciting part is that the shingles vaccine doesn’t have only preventive, delaying benefits for dementia, but also therapeutic potential for those who already have dementia,” Geldsetzer said. Survival gains hinted at reduced inflammatory pressure in advanced disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women gained stronger protection in both early and late stages. Women often mount higher &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-after-vaccination-improves-antibody-levels/"&gt;antibody&lt;/a&gt; responses after live vaccines. Varicella-zoster reactivation also appears more common in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These factors may amplify vaccine impact on immune tone. Cognitive decline risk falls as immune stability rises. Women showed reductions in mild cognitive impairment and dementia-related deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men did not show clear shifts in either stage. Sex-linked immune biology may hold crucial clues for future work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-preventing-dementia-with-shingles-vaccine"&gt;Preventing dementia with shingles vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;New work explores immune pathways independent of viral action. Some vaccines boost innate pathways in older age. Such boosts may counter immunosenescence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live vaccines often produce broad health gains unrelated to direct targets. Some work links vaccination with stronger long term immune balance. Reduced chronic inflammation may protect neural circuits across many decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New theory suggests cumulative viral reactivations erode &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/speech-pattern-wfd-that-is-a-clear-indication-a-person-is-in-cognitive-decline/"&gt;cognitive&lt;/a&gt; resilience. Shingles vaccination may interrupt harmful cycles early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar age-based rollouts in Australia and several other countries now show matching results. Records from England, New Zealand, and Canada echo the Welsh pattern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gains appear stable across cultures, health systems, and demographics. “We just keep seeing this strong protective signal for dementia in dataset after dataset,” Geldsetzer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such uniformity strengthens confidence in causal action. International teams now explore additional &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-eating-fungus-beauveria-bassiana-causes-the-immune-system-to-attack-neurons/"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt; markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dementia-lessons-from-shingles"&gt;Dementia lessons from shingles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A randomized trial could confirm these findings with full certainty. Geldsetzer called it simple. “It would be a very simple, pragmatic trial because we have a one-off intervention that we know is safe,” he said. Wales showed curve separation within one to two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trial may reveal early signals without long waits. Newer shingles vaccines may offer even stronger impact. Philanthropic support now aims to launch such work soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work suggests a single shot may slow decline across many stages of dementia. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/public-health-and-environmental-justice-the-push-for-electric-trucks-in-cities/"&gt;Public health&lt;/a&gt; systems rarely create natural experiments of such clarity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nation of Wales offered one such moment. Research now points toward practical potential for brain health in older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01256-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 19:36:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNVGxtZzVyOHRVaExtUzBzY2pXNEc2X3FRdlJ5dlpuVGR2MzZPVkNGU1BJMUY1UnBhb3BLVk4zYnlkbkVQOVJlQVJBMHo4OWpVVG50em91cFBwbTF5elJZRy1NOGhYZE1Yd0JHU2ZhQnQyNXFGRTBqdl82dThveG8wOUJocE5DcXphdjBJQ1JLVFdvbWdzYjAw</guid></item><item><title>黄金猎犬看到他的晚餐部分并立即选择暴力-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/golden-retriever-sees-dinner-portion-184000000.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are few ad campaigns more iconic than Snickers' "You're not yourself when you're hungry." And honestly, it worked because they were onto something. I can be many things in this life, but hungry is not the version of me anyone wants to meet. I've canceled first meetings out of fear of being hangry and unhinged. My therapist would call that self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And as it turns out, dogs aren't above that struggle either. Especially not golden retrievers, who may be angelic 90 percent of the time but turn into full-on dramatic divas the moment dinner is late—or, in this case, when dinner feels like a joke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/dog-face" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐶;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🐶&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/parade-pets" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:SIGN UP to get "pawsitivity" delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP to get "pawsitivity" delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/paw-prints" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐾🐾;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🐾🐾&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some pups get loud, some get pouty, but the golden retriever in this viral TikTok clip takes one look at his dinner portion and decides to enter his villain era. The moment his dad pours just a sprinkle of kibble into the bowl, everything inside this dog snaps like a glowstick at a middle-school dance. It is, without exaggeration, one of the most relatable funny dog videos of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Before we dive in, this isn't the first time a pet has delivered a meltdown worthy of an Oscar. Just recently, a &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/tiktok-t-stop-laughing-goldendoodle-144000340.html" data-ylk="slk:goldendoodle's emotional toy-aisle tantrum;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;goldendoodle's emotional toy-aisle tantrum&lt;/a&gt; had TikTok in tears from laughing, and this &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/very-tiny-very-angry-bunny-172000057.html" data-ylk="slk:tiny angry bunny losing his mind;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;tiny angry bunny losing his mind&lt;/a&gt; proved that even small pets can unleash big drama. Whether it is hunger rage, toy rage, or bunny rage, we are witnessing the full spectrum of unhinged animal behavior, and I must admit I am a fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Golden Retriever's Dinner Bowl Meltdown Is Sending TikTok Into Chaos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The golden retriever in the video starts hopeful, tail wagging, eyes bright, fully believing in the goodness of the world. Then Dad empties a few lonely pieces of kibble into his bowl and sweetly says, "Here you go, big guy." And that's when tragedy strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The dog freezes. The ominous music swells. One eyebrow goes up like he's questioning the entire foundation of their relationship. Then comes "the look." The universal dog expression that says, "BFFR."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/popcorn-explosion-tiktok-says-dog-014000429.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: The Popcorn Explosion TikTok Says This Dog Will Never Forget;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: The Popcorn Explosion TikTok Says This Dog Will Never Forget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the very next moment, chaos erupts. The video jumps from mild concern to "choose your fighter" energy as the golden retriever launches himself at his dad in full WWE mode. It's the kind of hangry dog behavior every pet parent recognizes: one second they're sweet, the next they're a chaotic gremlin fueled solely by betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;TikTok felt that energy instantly. One viewer joked, "So you have chosen… DEATH," while another added, "Oh, we still playing games?" Someone else even clocked that his tail, the golden retriever's emotional barometer, stopped wagging slowly, signaling that Dad had officially crossed the line with that tiny food portion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But even with all the drama, the clip is still peak golden retriever: 90 percent angel, 10 percent playful gremlin, and 100 percent hilarious. If you've ever been even one minute late to dinner time, you already know this story. Dogs take food very seriously and, apparently, portion sizes as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/dachshund-micromanaging-dad-tiktok-wheezing-194000916.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: This Dachshund Micromanaging His Dad Has TikTok Wheezing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: This Dachshund Micromanaging His Dad Has TikTok Wheezing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally published by &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/pet-news/golden-retriever-dinner-portion-violence-tiktok" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PetHelpful;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PetHelpful&lt;/a&gt; on Dec 3, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/pet-news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pet News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Pet News&lt;/a&gt; section.

Because, honestly, I don’t think “Hey, let’s not subject Caiden (or the overworked mall Santa) to another traumatic incident this year!” should be that difficult of a request. Let me ask you—are your in-laws psychotic Santa freaks, too? Are they going to cut off Caiden’s trust fund if he can’t keep his shit together while sitting on that strange man’s lap?&lt;/p&gt;

If Bridget laughs you off dismissively, there is only one thing left to do: Fill her entire underwear drawer with coal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7x50e00i8symcw2xlevs8@published"&gt;I am a divorced dad of three, a boy (12) and two girls (11, 8). I had a psychiatric emergency around the time of the divorce (I’m fine now). But as a result, my ex-wife has full custody, and I get the kids for four hours every weekend at my home. My question is about the anxiety I feel around the time with the kids, which is centered on the idea that I have to maximize every second to be a good dad given these circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="57" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq897a5000x3b785i1v3lun@published"&gt;Sometimes we watch cartoons, sometimes we play board games, we talk about random stuff and what’s going on at school. But other times I have a football game on and they play by themselves. None of them care about watching sports, but sometimes they hang around and watch a little, though usually they get into their own thing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq897a5000z3b78o0ovnbcv@published"&gt;All of this would be fine I think if it was part of more full-time parenting.  I’m fairly sure they get plenty of non-direct parenting when they are home with their mom, and they are comfortable on their own. But she gets days and nights with them and car trips and mall trips and family vacations, etc.  Because I only get these four hours I feel like I am supposed to be an all-out Dad for every minute of it, for them and for me.&lt;/p&gt;

I understand the anxiety and insecurity, but there is no way to ever be in “all-out” dad mode for four hours with three kids, so relieve yourself of that pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

Don’t catastrophize this!  I’m sure that thousands of “World’s Best Dad” coffee mugs have been gifted to fathers much lousier than you.&lt;/p&gt;

But–this is crucial–try not to obsess over having the perfect moment or being the perfect dad for that moment, and go easy on yourself and them. They’re glad you’re still in their lives, and I’m sure your ex-wife is, too. So when they’re in your care, read the room: The best way to show love and provide safety could be to let everyone feel like they can decompress however they need to, and that includes you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="149" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7x50e00iesymc33cvo6ic@published"&gt;I am so sad. My youngest daughter, E (29), is very much estranged from me but requires me to see her a few times during the year. This causes me much distress, but I want to remain present when she wants me to be there. The issue I am having is that she always throws me an offhand comment that has double meanings during these times. Her words hurt me very much. Up until yesterday, I have mostly not acknowledged them. But she stated, “I basically raised myself from 13 on.” I have recently realized that I had made some bad and uncharacteristic decisions from her thirteenth year up to about six months ago. I have had some great revelations in therapy and feel very grounded and future-focused. She’s in therapy too, and I know I am the reason for that. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2024/11/therapy-revelations-forgiveness-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;But she does not want to forgive me.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — A federal vaccine advisory committee this week is expected to discuss whether newborns should still get the hepatitis B vaccine — the first shot found to prevent cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal health recommendations now suggest that all babies be vaccinated against the liver infection in their first day of life, but U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s committee on Thursday is expected to change that — contradicting previous public health advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear exactly what the committee is considering, but the American Academy of Pediatrics will still urge a birth dose, said the organization’s Dr. Sean O’Leary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are going to continue to recommend it because it saves lives,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at the disease, the vaccine and the debate over changing the recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Liver disease can cause lifelong health issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection that for most people lasts less than six months. But for some — especially infants and children — it can become a long-lasting problem that can lead to liver failure, liver cancer and scarring called cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during injection-drug use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it can also be passed from an infected mother to a baby. As many as 90% of infants who contract hepatitis B go on to have chronic infections, meaning their immune systems don’t completely clear the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Infobox" data-module data-gtm-region="This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health.

    &lt;div class="Infobox-items RichTextBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/be-well"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more Be Well.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many as 2.4 million people in the U.S. are estimated to have hepatitis B, and as many as half are unaware they are infected, according to information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Baruch Blumberg, a federal scientist, identified the virus behind the infection in 1965. He won the Nobel Prize for the discovery, which led to tests and vaccines. The first hepatitis B vaccine was licensed in the U.S. in 1981. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Shots for newborns have been recommended for years&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, the nation’s vaccine guidance has been influenced by a government-appointed panel of experts, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Its recommendations have usually been adopted as national guidance that is widely heeded by doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1991, the committee recommended an initial dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth. The guidance was modified a little over the years and currently suggests a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms), plus follow-up shots to be given at about 1 month and 6 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why a dose right at birth? Health officials used to rely on screening expectant mothers to find babies that might have been exposed to the virus. But many cases were missed, experts say, because some women weren’t tested or test results were incorrect. Also, the virus can live on surfaces for more than seven days at room temperature, so unvaccinated children living with a person with a chronic infection can catch it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newborn hepatitis B vaccinations are widely considered to be a public health success story. Over about 30 years, cases among children fell from about 18,000 per year to about 2,200.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A collaboration of public health researchers, the Vaccine Integrity Project, this week released its &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project/hepatitis-b" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of more than 400 studies and reports spanning 40 years. The group concluded the birth dose is safe, and is an important reason U.S. pediatric hepatitis B infections have fallen.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Committee revisits the newborn recommendation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist before becoming the nation’s top health official, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-cdc-acip-vaccines-3790c89f45b6314c5c7b686db0e3a8f9"&gt;fired all 17 members&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of ACIP earlier this year and replaced them with a group that includes &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76"&gt;several anti-vaccine voices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel has raised concerns about giving a vaccine to a baby so early in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Are we asking our babies to solve an adult problem?” committee member Dr. Evelyn Griffin asked at a September meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peppered with questions about why a change was necessary, committee member Dr. Robert Malone said: “The signal that is prompting this is not one of safety. It’s one of trust. ... It’s one of parents uncomfortable with this medical procedure being performed at birth in a rather unilateral fashion without significant informed consent.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The committee tabled a vote at the September meeting, but it’s slated to be acted on during Thursday’s meeting, according to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-12-01-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the agenda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Federal officials have not answered questions about exactly how much of a delay is being proposed, or disclosed what research is being used as a basis for such a decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What would happen if the shots are delayed?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not knowing what the committee is contemplating makes it difficult to guess the potential impact. But some have tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, public health researchers collaborating with hepatitis-focused advocacy organizations released &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.24.25340907v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; estimating that delaying the birth dose to 2 months could result in at least 1,400 hepatitis B infections in children and 480 deaths. The report — which has yet to be peer reviewed or published in a medical journal — estimated the toll would be higher if the first dose was given even later.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;But an ACIP change to the recommendation may have limited impact, O’Leary said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee’s most direct power comes over what’s covered by the government Vaccines for Children program, which pays for shots for uninsured children from low-income families. Hepatitis B shots often have been bundled into the final hospital bill for childbirth. So a new ACIP recommendation likely would not be an economic obstacle for the current practice continuing at many hospitals, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But any change stands to confuse and frighten parents, he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If it scares, it shares” on social media, O’Leary said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several medical and public health organizations — and even some state government officials — have said, in advance of the meeting, that changing the recommendation is a terrible idea. Among them is a recently formed coalition of government leaders from several Northeastern states, which this week issued a statement saying they would continue to urge families to get a birth dose within 24 hours of delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington, this week called on Congress to compel Kennedy to appear at a hearing and explain ACIP’s actions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ending the decades-long recommendation that babies born in the U.S. get vaccinated against hepatitis B is a heartless choice to allow babies to die,” Murray said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7an1g000o3b78fxwxlqag@published"&gt;Parents are constantly reminded about food allergies. Whether it’s the sign on the day care window saying that the building is a nut-free space, or someone regaling you at a birthday party about all of the foods their child can’t eat, you can’t go for more than a day or two without thinking about allergic reactions. It’s just one more worry to add to the giant pile of things that you have at the back of your mind every day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7an3e000p3b78cmg797a2@published"&gt;But according to a &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/156/5/e2024070516/204636/Guidelines-for-Early-Food-Introduction-and?autologincheck=redirected"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, there’s good news in the realm of nuts. Peanut allergies have fallen precipitously, with rates dropping by 30 percent or more since 2013. It’s great news for anxious parents, for community spaces where children eat, and for all the kids who deserve to know the simple bliss of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Let’s look at the data the study is drawing from and at what has happened over the past few decades.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7an5c000q3b780r0kzw2k@published"&gt;Peanut allergies were for a long time something of a source of academic disagreement. In the ’80s, ’90s, and ’00s we saw a &lt;a href="https://thorax.bmj.com/content/62/1/91.short?casa_token=vmHy4vQLsPIAAAAA:w-wOJjY5PEGBPhNOEWy1umYtUICdtCwx8zgpppoGcQDPyHQr7SlVrQ1D6g0TmZ0M6CWOpQVkmsKL"&gt;sharp increase&lt;/a&gt; in the number of children with allergies to a variety of foods. We still aren’t entirely clear on whether this was due to better measurement of disease, better testing, or some environmental trigger that could’ve impacted children’s health.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7an98000r3b7840cpggyy@published"&gt;The advice at the time was that the &lt;a href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20120209132957/http:/cot.food.gov.uk/pdfs/cotpeanutall.pdf"&gt;best strategy was avoidance&lt;/a&gt; for those at high risk of developing an allergy, determined by a combination of family history, other allergies, and having eczema, which can indicate allergy issues. If you’re never exposed to an allergen, you can’t develop an allergy, and this would result in fewer allergies in the community, the theory went. However, this advice &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/02770903.2015.1126848?casa_token=7iNQkW1BzjcAAAAA%3AS2U2SF0j6feAhrIGJ-5slwZILZQ8-xwoYANFNO9s04yR2YMBQAxsSGjympvQr46VuArJGoc7kXfO_w"&gt;did not seem&lt;/a&gt; to stem the rising tide of allergies, and in 2008 the American Academy of Pediatrics &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/121/1/183/71045?autologincheck=redirected&amp;amp;utm_source=TrendMD&amp;amp;utm_medium=TrendMD&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Pediatrics_TrendMD_0&amp;amp;casa_token=O8hiPhHAYMMAAAAA:P8oMCNdWIouyzULKot_8s15KBq-S6gbPDrHdR8C7BX3kgM2vl2j2rkVJEvMIAQKcKPKXOdZUNg"&gt;officially changed&lt;/a&gt; the recommendations to say that there was no benefit to avoiding foods.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7anbb000s3b78ykxeip23@published"&gt;This is where the story gets really interesting. A group of researchers noticed that peanut allergies were &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674908016989?casa_token=P73_tXyYcW4AAAAA:JB96jXXix7W32QCckINiKlvlZq4h0c-VwWWnTTOzJ2s0WWywfdIqSi6tXt-91-jaG1IYJyLvVg"&gt;10 times more common&lt;/a&gt; in the U.K. than in Israel. While there are many differences between the two countries, they hypothesized that this could be because Israeli children are exposed to peanuts early and often through a range of peanut-based snacks. U.K. children, on the other hand, have a much lower exposure to peanuts in their early years.&lt;/p&gt;

    


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7andk000t3b78jn8osa3z@published"&gt;This led to a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1414850"&gt;truly fascinating randomized trial&lt;/a&gt; published in 2015. Researchers took a large group of infants aged 4–11 months who were at a very high risk of getting a peanut allergy—either they already had severe eczema, an egg allergy, or both. These kids were then randomly allocated to either get peanuts regularly until they were 5 years old, or have no exposure to peanuts at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7ang0000u3b78fh5nno6h@published"&gt;The results were, in a word, startling: 1 in 7 of the children in the no-peanuts group developed an allergy by age 5, compared to just 1 in 50 in the peanut group. Early peanut exposure reduced a child’s risk of developing an allergy to peanuts by a little over seven times.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7ani0000v3b78cgmpb96n@published"&gt;The study immediately changed recommendations. Rather than the previous advice—which at that point was that we didn’t really know whether exposure made a difference or not—pediatricians started to advise that kids should be exposed to potential food allergens early and often. At the very least, every baby should get peanuts before they turned 1. It’s the advice I was given when my daughter was born in 2023, and it’s probably very familiar to new parents everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7ankb000w3b781icktlne@published"&gt;The new research that’s just hit the headlines shows that this advice appears to be working. &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/156/5/e2024070516/204636/Guidelines-for-Early-Food-Introduction-and?autologincheck=redirected"&gt;The Pediatrics journal study&lt;/a&gt; is an observational paper looking at trends in peanut allergies in a cohort of children in the United States. The authors took kids aged 0–3 from 2013–2015, before the new advice came out, and compared them to a cohort from 2015–2019. They used a variety of statistical models to examine what happened with respect to peanut allergies and eczema over the course of two years for the children in each of these groups.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="41" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7anmw000x3b78t4jjcz4c@published"&gt;Overall, there was a reduction of around 30 percent in peanut allergies. In absolute terms, around 1 in 100 kids had a diagnosed peanut allergy before the guidelines changed, and around 1 in 300 had an allergy in the years after.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7anoy000y3b78zvnpw6s2@published"&gt;There are always caveats to this sort of research. While the authors did use a type of statistical modeling called an interrupted time series, which in theory allows us to make causal claims here, in practice it’s a bit more complicated. We can’t be entirely sure that this decline is driven by the guideline change. On the other hand, it’s hard to see what else could be happening here. We know that introducing peanuts early reduces peanut allergies, so the fact that they fell after the new guidelines is exactly what we’d expect.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiq7anqv000z3b78k9ycn4vc@published"&gt;This whole story is a great example of science working exactly as intended. It’s messy, and a bit painful, but through rigorous experimentation we came to the right conclusion. We had a theory that didn’t pan out. We then came up with another theory, which proved to be true. We changed the guidelines to reflect this, and are now preventing tens of thousands of kids from developing allergies every year. In a time when science is under relentless attack, it’s a heartening reminder that the whole process can work well.

                        &lt;/div&gt;

                        
                &lt;p&gt;

                &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleasure is a dirty word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean this in two ways. First are the connotations or associations of the word. If a colleague asked you, “How much pleasure have you had this morning?” you might fire off an email to HR. If you saw the title “Learning to find pleasure,” or “Enjoy more pleasure,” you’d probably expect it to be in the roped-off section of the bookshop. Pleasure is frequently associated with the erotic. But second, pleasure is a dirty word because, across a variety of religious traditions and over several millennia of philosophical thought, “pleasure” has often been seen as base: vulgar, crude, and animalistic. Those who seek pleasure are no better than pigs rutting and scoffing in the mud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this week’s Mini Philosophy interview, I spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.uni.lodz.pl/pracownicy/katarzyna-de-lazari-radek"&gt;Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek&lt;/a&gt;, who has literally written the book on pleasure: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Pleasure-Introduction-Katarzyna-Lazari-Radek/dp/1138093114"&gt;The Philosophy of Pleasure: An Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. De Lazari-Radek is a hedonist, which means she thinks that the only good in life is pleasure and the only bad in life is pain. We want pleasure; we don’t want pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For de Lazari-Radek, it is ridiculous to call pleasure bad or dirty because pleasure is an experience — an immediate, unmistakable signal that something is good. And here we learn how to find more of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-basic-reality-of-pleasure"&gt;The basic reality of pleasure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pleasure doesn’t have to be some “higher” mystical state of joy or euphoria. It certainly doesn’t have to be some kind of “guilty indulgence.” Pleasure is a basic, biological feature of being a living animal — as basic as warmth or tiredness. De Lazari-Radek insists it’s not a &lt;em&gt;sensation &lt;/em&gt;— not the same thing as the taste of chocolate or the pressure of a hug — but a &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt;, an evaluative gloss you lay over whatever else is happening. She calls it a “sugar coating” we apply to experience: It’s the sense of “Yes, this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you frame pleasure in this way — as an important heuristic or gauge — then it seems ridiculous to say seeking pleasure is bad. In fact, to say “seeking pleasure is bad” is functionally equivalent to saying “it’s bad to do what you want to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For de Lazari-Radek, one of the reasons that people have moralized pleasure is that they confuse the &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; of pleasure with the &lt;em&gt;source &lt;/em&gt;of pleasure. “This is why,” she said, “we then talk about good and bad pleasures. Because, yes, of course, if you take pleasure in hurting others, then it may be bad, but that’s because hurting others is bad and not because pleasure itself is bad. I mean, pleasure is just this feeling, yes? So, we need to be clear and careful about saying that certain actions or certain sources may be bad. But there is nothing bad in the experience of pleasure itself. It can’t be, because it’s exactly how it feels, and almost by definition, it is always good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For de Lazari-Radek, we need to disentangle pleasure — the feeling and evaluative gloss — from the source of that feeling. Taking pleasure in something might be bad if it involves something bad, but the pleasure itself is good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ways-to-enjoy-pleasure"&gt;Ways to enjoy pleasure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distinguishing between the source and experience of pleasure raises not only interesting moral questions but also hedonic ones as well. De Lazari-Radek argues that when we start to focus on the source of pleasures, we can learn to enjoy the sheer variety of pleasures that are out there to be enjoyed. Here are three examples from our conversation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-regarding and other-regarding pleasure:&lt;/strong&gt; Some pleasures might be an act of intentional self-care—a bath, a massage, a walk in the woods. When you come back from work, tired and stressed from that meeting that went on too long, you might crack open a new tub of ice cream. But other pleasures might involve helping other people. As de Lazari-Radek pointed out, “There is enough psychological research to show that for us to be happier, we do need to feel that we are responsible for certain things.” Sometimes, we should consciously commit to things that are other-regarding and that involve charity and responsibility, such as cooking for your children, helping someone at work, or smiling at a stranger in the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Present and delayed pleasure:&lt;/strong&gt; How does going for a run fit into the hedonist’s life? How does raising kids, working late at work, or studying really hard? If life is about responsible pleasure, why not just live like a pleasure-seeking moth, fluttering from thrill to thrill?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we pursue these things not because they feel good now, but because they create pleasure later. This is a deeply adult kind of hedonism. It’s an understanding that slow mastery, accumulated effort, and long arcs of growth are among the richest pleasure sources available. Give a little to get a lot. Sow the seeds, and reap the rewards. Work hard to play hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expected and unexpected pleasure: &lt;/strong&gt;You get out a glass, pop open the bottle, and pour the wine. As you lift the glass to your lips, you think, “Oooh, yes, this is going to be good.” And it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many pleasures are planned and expected in this way. We are rational, deliberative creatures, and we set aside a huge amount of time to plan our pleasure. But de Lazari-Radek also pointed out that pleasure often appears without desire. You pass a bakery and smell fresh bread. Your child laughs in the next room. You overhear a stranger say something unintentionally poetic. “Pleasure just comes in,” she said, and that’s a beautiful and important point. Sometimes happiness just arrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can all build our lives to increase the chances of being pleasantly ambushed. More wandering. More curiosity. More stepping away from the algorithmic walls that funnel your attention.&lt;br&gt;In other words, set yourself up to welcome more pleasure in. There is nothing wrong with pleasure, but a whole lot right. And, if de Lazari-Radek’s hedonism is right, a happy and healthy life might just be one that finds as much ethically sourced pleasure as we can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;This will be brief because I have written about it before.  The White House cover-up artists have stated that the bruises on the President’s right hand are due to his use of aspirin and trauma from shaking hands.  But the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology recommend AGAINST the use of aspirin in individuals 70 years or older due to the increased risk of internal bleeding EXCEPT if they have evidence of cardiovascular disease or a history of a previous cardiovascular event (heart attack, stroke, etc).  As far as I am aware, the venous stasis problems that Donald  admits to is not an indication for aspirin, even to prevent clots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sooo, either the President’s physician is incorrectly prescribing aspirin or Donald is ducking the fact that he’s had an event or has evidence of cardiovascular disease that he, his physician and those around him are covering up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have hoped that the legacy media would have promoted this story by now.  I guess it remains for us to do so. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;

The mice were tested for changes in memory and motor function over a 12-week period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behavior tests on the mice showed that hydrogen sulfide improved cognitive and motor function by 50 percent compared to mice that did not receive the injections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice that received the treatment were better able to remember the locations of platform edits and appeared more physically active than the mice that had simulated Alzheimer’s disease but did not receive the treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results showed that the behavioral outcomes of Alzheimer’s disease could be reversed by introducing hydrogen sulfide, but the researchers wanted to investigate how the brain chemically reacted to the gaseous molecule,” Johns Hopkins Medicine &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2021/01/rotten-egg-gas-could-guard-against-alzheimers-disease"&gt;wrote in a press release about the study. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 lnqVrP"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/03/14/37/iStock-187272969.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/03/14/37/iStock-187272969.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/03/14/37/iStock-187272969.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Sulfhydration levels in the brain decrease with age, the scientists said, noting the trend has a greater presence in Alzheimer’s patients" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-272427"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Sulfhydration levels in the brain decrease with age, the scientists said, noting the trend has a greater presence in Alzheimer’s patients&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A series of experiments revealed a change to a common enzyme called glycogen synthase β (GSK3β). When there are healthy levels of hydrogen sulfide, GSK3β acts as a signaling molecule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that in the absence of hydrogen sulfide, GSK3β is overattracted to another protein in the brain called Tau. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When GSK3β and Tau interact, Tau causes clumps inside nerve cells. As those clumps grow, the tangled proteins block communication between the nerves, eventually causing them to die, according to the researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This leads to the deterioration and eventual loss of cognition, memory and motor function that is characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease,” the press release said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding the cascade of events is important to designing therapies that can block this interaction like hydrogen sulfide is able to do,” Ph.D student Daniel Giovinazzo, the first author of the study, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until just a few years ago, researchers lacked the tools to mimic how the body makes small quantities of hydrogen sulfide inside cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The compound used in this study does just that and shows by correcting brain levels of hydrogen sulfide, we could successfully reverse some aspects of Alzheimer’s disease,” collaborator Dr. Matt Whiteman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 15:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNVG1LVFJ3Zk5BYkZ5cnF4LWJCeDB0LVVnOFY3bE5GWkw0SmVLRU5uOUhWTTNqQ0R5TlN4QzdJc2phZ3FWVVRNaGR5M0JieDNpZDdBTGFXa1pJb1NOc0g1OThKLXkwcnpuQ2ZfVm5vNEVpdS01TE55aERYQ1ZYNHNEUWM3a0hDTWFRS0pxLUJKRUVmaHVqVThWc1ZKdDhZUQ</guid></item><item><title>拥有22年经验的癌症外科医生分享“1个常见习惯” ，默默破坏您的免疫系统|健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cancer-surgeon-with-22-years-of-experience-shares-the-1-common-habit-silently-destroying-your-immune-system-101764775091750.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storyMainDiv" class="fullStory tfStory current videoStory story__detail storyAf101764775091750 " data-vars-storyid="101764775091750" data-story-section="lifestyle" data-story-subsection="health" data-vars-author="Akanksha Agnihotri" data-premium-story="false" data-performance-type="not-set" data-story-title="Cancer surgeon with 22 years of experience shares the ‘1 common habit’ silently destroying your immune system" data-collapse-article="true"&gt; &lt;p class="htEchoTopPageBanner dHide"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="stickyCard"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h1 class="hdg1"&gt;Cancer surgeon with 22 years of experience shares the ‘1 common habit’ silently destroying your immune system&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;div class="actionDiv flexElm topTime"&gt; &lt;p class="dateTime secTime storyPage"&gt;Published on: Dec 03, 2025 09:01 pm IST &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="googleFollow mHide"&gt; &lt;button class="htEchoShareBarDesk"&gt;&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2 class="sortDec"&gt;Always scrolling late or binge-watching shows?

And that key is sleep. Poor sleep weakens your immunity. When your sleep is disturbed, your body becomes more susceptible to fatigue, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/diabetes" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="diabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, autoimmune disorders, and many other illnesses,” Dr Krishna explains.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He adds, “Our body has the natural ability to fight diseases, but we don’t use it properly. This is because during sleep time, we are often glued to our phones. To reduce inflammation in our body, we need proper sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to strengthen your immunity through sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Krishna further explains the science behind it, “When we stay awake, the hormone melatonin, which is the sleep hormone, doesn’t get a chance to work.&lt;/span&gt; And this is why our &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/immune-system" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="immune system"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; cannot recharge. To strengthen our immunity, we need to let our system recharge, and proper sleep is essential for that.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He advises prioritising consistent, uninterrupted sleep to allow the body to heal, recharge, and maintain a strong defence against illnesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

"She literally does not know what planet she's on right now," said Baffoe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After admiring her cute surgical onesie, which is actually pretty becoming, considering what it's for, she puts Lady on the couch for a nice, long nap under the &lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/bulldog-lays-on-human-like-a-furry-weighted-blanket" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blankets;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;blankets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"She's getting all the love, all the snuggles, and all the treats this week," said Baffoe at the end of the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/dog-face" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐶;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🐶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/parade-pets" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP to get “pawsitivity” delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;SIGN UP to get “pawsitivity” delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/paw-prints" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐾🐾;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🐾🐾&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What Are the Health Benefits of Spaying a Dog?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is so much literature you can read on the health benefits of spaying and neutering a dog, and you should discuss it at length with your vet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, it should be noted that with female dogs like Lady, a &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/pets/reasons-spay-neuter-pet" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 460,000 cats and 2.2 million dogs found that spayed cats live 39% longer and spayed dogs live 23% longer than their unspayed counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Both spayed dogs and cats are less likely to develop certain cancers, as well as diseases and infections like pyometra, according to &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/pets/reasons-spay-neuter-pet" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:WebMD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;WebMD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For male dogs who are neutered, they won't develop testicular cancer, which is common in &lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/senior-pug-looks-young-old-same-time" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:older dogs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;older dogs&lt;/a&gt; who haven't had the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Neutered dogs also have a lower risk of developing enlarged prostate glands, and neutering increases their life expectancy by 18%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/influencer-halley-kate-referees-three-dachshunds-every-morning" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: Influencer Halley Kate Serves as Referee With 3 Dachshunds Every Morning at Breakfast;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Related: Influencer Halley Kate Serves as Referee With 3 Dachshunds Every Morning at Breakfast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally published by &lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/dachshund-mom-pampers-puppy-after-spaying" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade Pets;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Parade Pets&lt;/a&gt; on Dec 3, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pet News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Pet News&lt;/a&gt; section.

That's a seemingly small but meaningful statistical difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For obesity, the respective figures were roughly 18 percent of smartphone users compared to 12 percent of 12-year-olds without these devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for sleep, 47 percent of 12-year-olds with phones reported &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-night-of-poor-sleep-can-change-how-your-brain-sees-food"&gt;insufficient sleep&lt;/a&gt; (less than nine hours a night) compared to 31 percent of their phone-less peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183977" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183977" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/KidPhone.jpg" alt="Young kid on a phone" class="wp-image-183977 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/KidPhone.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/KidPhone-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/KidPhone-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/KidPhone-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183977" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers want to see further measures taken to protect kids from the potential harms of phones.

However, there was no noticeable change in obesity risk over that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers admit that phone use can have benefits, as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/maybe-screen-time-isn-t-to-blame-for-teen-mental-health-after-all"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown, but they want to see more done to make sure that these devices are used responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For many teens, smartphones can play a constructive role by strengthening social connections, supporting learning, and providing access to information and resources that promote personal growth," &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/childrens-hospital-philadelphia-study-links-smartphone-ownership-childhood-increased-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Barzilay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Likewise, some families may view a smartphone as a necessity for safety or communication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some nuances in the data. For example, depression was measured as any period of depression during the life of the child so far, so it may have occurred &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/maybe-screen-time-isn-t-to-blame-for-teen-mental-health-after-all"&gt;before they got a phone&lt;/a&gt;, in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also not possible to draw any conclusions about cause and effect in an observational study like this, but the strength of the associations – plus the changes that were recorded between ages 12 and 13 as some kids got phones and others didn't – are worth investigating further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings tie in with what we know about adults and smartphones: that these devices can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-is-why-smartphones-are-bad-for-our-brains"&gt;elevate stress&lt;/a&gt;, leave us feeling &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-even-more-research-confirming-how-distracting-our-phones-are"&gt;more distracted and drained&lt;/a&gt;, and reshape the way &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/giving-up-your-phone-for-just-3-days-can-reshape-your-brain-activity"&gt;our brains are wired&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In future studies, the researchers want to look at how much screen time and different types of apps affect these results, how the findings might extend over longer periods of adolescence, and what countermeasures could be put in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's critical for young people to have time away from their phones to engage in physical activity, which can protect against obesity and enhance mental health over time," &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/childrens-hospital-philadelphia-study-links-smartphone-ownership-childhood-increased-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Barzilay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2025-072941"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK — It's flu season, and flu cases are on the rise across New York State.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald on Tuesday declared that influenza is prevalent in the state.  The state is now requiring that unvaccinated health care personnel wear masks in areas where patients and residents may be present.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The declaration that flu is prevalent across the state means health care facilities and agencies must require that personnel who are not vaccinated against the flu wear a mask to avoid exposing patients and residents to the flu virus,” State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said in a press release. “The flu vaccine is the best way to protect against infection and lessens symptoms if you get the flu. I encourage everyone 6 months and older to get a flu shot, and it’s not too late to protect yourself and your loved ones.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The declaration includes health care and residential care facilities and agencies regulated by the State Health Department. Under the rules, personnel who have not received this season’s flu vaccine must wear surgical or procedure masks while influenza is considered prevalent in New York. The regulations will allow masks to be removed when workers accompany patients in the community, provide speech therapy services, or communicate with people who lip read.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State data through Nov. 22 show 17,783 positive flu cases have been reported across all 62 counties so far this season. Outside New York City, lab-confirmed flu cases rose 114% week over week, increasing from 1,688 to 3,619. In New York City, cases climbed 119%, rising from 1,890 to 4,146.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospitalizations due to influenza increased 99%, up from 208 the previous week to 413 statewide.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials urged New Yorkers last month to get the seasonal flu vaccine to prevent influenza-associated child deaths. During the 2024-2025 season, 27 deaths in children younger than 18 were reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiqbalkf00003b6qgb5bg4c5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The childhood vaccine schedule in the United States could soon see major changes, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s handpicked advisers expected to revise the timing of hepatitis B shots for newborns and re-examine long-established vaccination practices.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiqdrnms00043b6qagnrg9am@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The hepatitis B decision would be the most significant change to the childhood vaccine schedule yet under Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist who is now secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services. He abruptly &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/health/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisers-removed"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; the 17 sitting members of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s independent vaccine advisory committee earlier this year and replaced them with his own choices.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiqdrnmt00053b6qj553v9zm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since then, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ priorities and processes have changed, resulting in chaotic meetings and votes that risk &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/20/health/vaccines-city-health-officials"&gt;limiting access &lt;/a&gt;to vaccines or stray from data-driven decision-making of the past.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiqdrnmt00063b6qq89hwakx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-12-01-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;agenda&lt;/a&gt; for this week’s meeting offers scant details about what will be presented or by whom. Thursday’s meeting will include discussion and voting on whether to delay hepatitis B vaccination, which is currently recommended for babies just after birth. Friday’s schedule includes more discussion on vaccine ingredients and timing but no planned votes. Reference documents and voting language typically posted ahead of meetings have not yet been made available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiqdrkti00023b6qorj8mzr8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The consequences of the committee’s votes and plans can have big implications for vaccination in the United States. ACIP’s recommendations shape doctors’ guidance to patients as well as state vaccine policy, insurance coverage and the Vaccines for Children program.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiqe2bjw000j3b6qqcwgqtt5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The committee has already made some changes. In June, the panel &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/26/health/cdc-acip-vaccines-rsv-thimerosal"&gt;endorsed&lt;/a&gt; thimerosal-free vaccines, although there’s no evidence of harm from the vaccine preservative. Then, in September, it recommended &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/18/health/cdc-vaccine-panel-acip-mmrv-hepatitis"&gt;splitting up&lt;/a&gt; the combined measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox vaccine and announced plans to investigate long-settled vaccine science.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiqe3bvr000m3b6q75v63ihq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The newly appointed committee has also seen shifts in its membership. This week, HHS announced that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/01/health/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-kulldorff"&gt;Dr. Martin Kulldorff,&lt;/a&gt; the committee’s recent chair, has left to take a new role within the agency. Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a cardiologist who has criticized the Covid-19 vaccine, will take over as the new chair.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiqdrnmt00093b6qxxu613ft@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The moves come just after a top US Food and Drug Administration official said in an &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/29/politics/vaccine-approval-process-fda-official"&gt;internal memo&lt;/a&gt; that the agency will adopt a new approval process for vaccines to require more evidence of their safety and value before they can be marketed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiqe435y000p3b6qkodmkcon@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The truth of the matter is, we know vaccines have saved lives. They are saving lives actively,” Dr. Raynard Washington, director of Mecklenburg County Public Health in North Carolina and head of the Big Cities Health Coalition, said ahead of the CDC advisers’ meeting. “They’re saving costs for our community, both in terms of financial cost — health care costs, health care resources — and expense on individuals’ lives.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjcq0e000f3b6qldrljnnt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ahead of Thursday’s vote, it’s not clear what evidence is driving the CDC vaccine committee’s plans for hepatitis B vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiplrbkn00013b6q7tb1kqf8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The risks from the disease are significant: Viral infection can hide in the body for years, until it leads to liver failure, cirrhosis or cancer. No new studies have revealed safety concerns about the hepatitis B vaccine, and there has been a dramatic decline in cases among infants since 1991, when the CDC recommended universal vaccination for babies. Reported hepatitis B infections in infants plummeted from an estimated 18,000 cases every year to about 20 per year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjcq0e000h3b6qkppbkdn0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, anti-vaccine activists have long questioned the need for the birth dose of the vaccine, since hepatitis B is mainly transmitted through dirty drug needles or sexual activity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjcq0e000i3b6qj6ix63cy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Why would you give that to a 1-day-old child?” Kennedy asked &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DeLW9s6NpS7w%26t%3D3257s&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjamie.gumbrecht%40cnn.com%7Ce8dd39b2642a4e6d307608de31c6a91f%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C639002926496541546%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=ssHsvTVq1%2FmmhdUGYiBXt48xgFzhO9kBv3ZXYtajrv4%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;in a June town hall&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s really a profit motive.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Infectious disease experts say the sharp drop in case numbers show that the strategy works. It created a safety net for babies at risk from pregnant mothers or other family members who may not know they have the virus, and saved them from a life of tough treatments and constant dread of spreading the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjcq0e000k3b6qnd5j5cfi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I understand that babies, of course, are precious and appear to be quite vulnerable, but they’re also vulnerable to hepatitis B,” said Dr. Anthony Fiore, an infectious diseases physician and former CDC official.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “You have this opportunity to prevent a disease very easily that has very serious long-term consequences. There’s kind of no going back.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            When he was 16, John Ellis Jr. went to the doctor with severe stomach pain. He was expecting to be sent home with Tums and advice to eat healthier, but blood tests revealed a terrifying surprise: chronic hepatitis B.

            Ellis and his mom, a nurse, thought it was a mistake. There are highly effective vaccines — he’d gotten a dose in middle school — and they didn’t know anyone with hepatitis B.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjdx91000u3b6qvln2jql2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Ellis was born in 1990, just before the hepatitis B birth dose became standard.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjdx91000v3b6q2grw3i6j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before 1991, mothers were recommended to be tested for hepatitis B during pregnancy so their babies could be vaccinated shortly after birth, if needed — a strategy the current CDC vaccine advisers&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/19/health/cdc-acip-hepatitis-mmrv-covid-vaccine"&gt; recommended&lt;/a&gt; at their last meeting. But tests were often lost or results were jumbled. Many patients weren’t tested at all. Even if a mother wasn’t infected, unvaccinated babies had no protection from other relatives, caregivers or peers who could spread the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjdx91000w3b6qp6tq85ne@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is no way to know how Ellis became infected. Based on the scarring on his liver, his doctors estimated that it happened when he was 3 or 4. It could have been at day care, school or the dentist’s office.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiplczma001v3b6qeq68wj2o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What he knew at 16 was that his life was over.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjdx91000x3b6q6lm8fns2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I thought that I was not going to survive it,” said Ellis, who’s now 35 and lives in his hometown of Pensacola, Florida.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjdx91000y3b6qyig2abwk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Adults who are infected with hepatitis B usually clear it with no lasting effects. For kids, it’s different. About 90% of babies who are infected will carry the virus for life, and all the risks of organ failure, liver scarring or cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjdx91000z3b6q2cwnst37@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A new modeling study, released as a &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.24.25340907v1" target="_blank"&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt; ahead of this week’s ACIP meeting, suggests that delaying babies’ hepatitis B vaccines for even a few months will drive up infections, long-term health complications and deaths. The researchers behind the analysis, which has not been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal, had previously developed hepatitis B vaccination models to inform ACIP decisions. So far, they say they haven’t heard from the committee about their new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjdx9100103b6qu71h3wzs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study found that delaying the birth dose to 2 months for babies whose mothers are not known to have hepatitis B — either because they tested negative or because their results are unknown — could lead to at least 1,400 preventable infections among children and 480 deaths for each year the delay is in place. Delaying the dose for 12 years could surge preventable infections to 2,700 and deaths to nearly 800 for each year of the recommendation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiq0lc3800023b6q9860n3l6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even if there was “perfect adherence” to vaccine recommendations, a 2-month delay among children whose parents tested negative for hepatitis B would lead to 90 acute infections, 75 chronic infections and 29 deaths for every year of the policy. Delaying it by 12 years pushes those numbers even higher.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjdx9100113b6qa153uzq8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Any delays would drive up health care costs by tens or hundreds of millions of dollars every year, the study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjdx9100123b6qm4q90zst@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When it turns into a chronic disease, it does not have a cure, and so infections that progress to a chronic condition end up needing, potentially, a lot of medical management and care and monitoring throughout life,” said Dr. Eric Hall, lead author of the study and an assistant professor at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjdx9100133b6qs731qzzh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My hope is that the committee understands that universal infant vaccination has been the cornerstone of hepatitis B elimination efforts” for decades, Hall said. “We’ve made a lot of good progress towards that, and it’s important that we don’t undo that important progress now.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjdvej000r3b6qgmcc0lf0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ellis’ diagnosis landed him with a liver biopsy, medication and regular visits to the doctor. He learned that hepatitis B didn’t mean his life was over. He began to exercise and ride his bike. Rather than hiding his condition, he wondered, what if he was radically open about it?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjem6y001a3b6qk63fguu9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At 17, he organized a 1,200-mile bike ride from Pensacola to Philadelphia, where the Hepatitis B Foundation is based. He rode with his best friend and his grandma in a chase car. His high school principal spoke at their sendoff. They biked about 60 miles every day for weeks, and for the last stretch — just as Ellis turned 18 — they were joined by Dr. Baruch Blumberg, the Nobel Prize-winning doctor who had discovered the hepatitis B virus and developed the vaccine against it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjem6y001b3b6qw45kbz2k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ellis said it was “a full-circle moment.” He can see how science was helping him and others, and how his mom, friends and community surrounded him and showed what it meant to live with hepatitis B. Nearly two decades later, it’s still fresh in his mind.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjem6y001c3b6qbgfudlxp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But, Ellis said, his experience is not typical. He knows other hepatitis B patients whose families dismissed them. It can feel impossible to explain to friends or potential romantic partners.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjem6y001d3b6qoj6zhnai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He said some of the rhetoric from the federal government paints everyone with hepatitis B as drug users or people with risky sexual behaviors, as if it makes it OK to “other” them. As if the disease could never hit that close to home.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjem6y001e3b6qy6rbcbfx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re people that got exposed. We didn’t ask for it,” Ellis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjem6y001f3b6qvdlsbksi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m like anybody else. I’m trying to live a full life and be as unburdened by my condition as I can.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjem6y001g3b6q3o4gwy26@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So far, he’s been fortunate. He owns his real estate business in his hometown and has lifelong friends. His viral load is low, and he’s generally healthy. But he wonders how long it will last. There’s a reason hepatitis B is called “the silent killer,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjem6y001h3b6qnvwe0436@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Parents can make their own vaccine decisions for their babies, he said, and they should be empowered with information, including the realities of the risks of hepatitis B.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjem6y001i3b6q56ieerid@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If we’re making it harder for people who do choose to vaccinate, that’s what I take issue with,” Ellis said. “I would much rather vaccination be available at birth than to have someone else live the experience that I’ve lived.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmipjem6y001j3b6q76f9lbo4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m a living, breathing example of what the risks are.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

That’s not breaking news. Sugars and artificial flavors &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/01/what-is-the-healthiest-coke/85375529007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;lack quality nutrition&lt;/a&gt;.

But that’s not so healthy either. Recent research found that even &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/10/08/soda-diet-liver-disease-study-research/86579096007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;just one can of diet soda&lt;/a&gt; can contribute to &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/12/12/can-you-get-diabetes-from-eating-too-much-sugar/71764449007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;liver&lt;/a&gt; disease. Regular soda, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Yet, many Americans are addicted to fizzy drinks. And for those who wish to stop, cutting soda cold-turkey might not be a good idea — as some USA TODAY journalists &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/10/29/soda-health-side-effects-quitting-caffeine/86585472007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;recently learned&lt;/a&gt; when we tried it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“People are struggling to stop even though they really want to,” explains Ashley Gearhardt, professor of psychology at the University of Michigan. “You go through withdrawal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That’s because soda &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/11/12/soda-addiction-science-sugar-caffeine/86963258007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;appeals to our brain’s instinctual desire&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/12/20/is-corn-syrup-bad-for-you/71848699007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;sugars&lt;/a&gt; and fats that help us survive — and our bodies adapt to increasingly high exposure to these ingredients over time, raising tolerance and making quitting painful, Gearhardt explains. You may get headaches, &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/05/31/why-am-i-so-angry-all-the-time/83835896007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;irritability&lt;/a&gt; and anxiety, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“You have to think about it as if you were quitting smoking,” Gearhardt says. “You need to know what are your cues? What are your triggers? What emotions set you off? Certain times of day? Certain people? … Then you can come up with plans for a replacement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The alternative that’s right for you has a lot to do with why you’re drinking soda in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Here's how to get started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;The best soda alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“If people want caffeine, switching to coffee without sweetener is much healthier,” Gearhardt says, but she gives one warning: “Getting caffeine through soda gives energy much faster. You may not get as intense of a caffeine hit from coffee, so there might be a little bit of grieving … but that’s because we weren’t supposed to be getting that in the first place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Morning headache? You can also try over-the-counter medications that contain a bit of &lt;a href="/story/life/2022/12/02/how-much-caffeine-is-dangerous/10723118002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, says Jennifer Temple, director of the Nutrition and Health Research Laboratory at the University of Buffalo. If you’re using soda to address a chronic medical issue, such as &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/21/why-does-my-head-hurt/85661258007/?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=deeperdive&amp;amp;utm_campaign=oc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;migraines&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a good idea to consult your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/05/28/is-green-tea-good-for-you-health-benefits-every-day/70244800007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Tea is a good option&lt;/a&gt; for a later-in-the-day &lt;a href="/story/life/2022/12/02/how-much-caffeine-is-dangerous/10723118002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;caffeine boost&lt;/a&gt; as it generally contains less caffeine than coffee. And if you can’t stand the taste of coffee or tea, remember there are many varieties and flavors to try – and either of these beverages with a bit of natural sweetener or &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/04/01/is-milk-good-for-you/82639148007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt; is going to be better for you than soda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If you love &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/09/25/is-seltzer-water-bad-for-you/70823544007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;carbonation&lt;/a&gt;, Gearhardt says to try seltzer or non-sweetened &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/09/26/is-seltzer-water-bad-for-you/86335041007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;sparkling water&lt;/a&gt; "in the periods you would be going for a soda.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If you love soda for the taste, Temple suggests making “spa water” flavored with lemon, &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/06/08/are-cucumbers-good-for-you/83973776007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;cucumber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/07/17/what-is-ginger-beneficial-for/84468526007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;ginger&lt;/a&gt;, mint, basil or other &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/22/are-mandarin-oranges-good-for-you/85670307007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;fresh ingredients&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Electrolyte powders, &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/07/25/is-apple-juice-good-for-you/85253328007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;juice&lt;/a&gt; and kombucha also substitute sweetness and &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/04/12/can-dehydration-cause-high-blood-pressure/11634018002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;quench thirst&lt;/a&gt;, but be careful of sneaky high sodium amounts or other &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/11/13/is-erythritol-safe/71485440007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;additives&lt;/a&gt;, Gearhardt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;When soda is your best bet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Soda is OK to use as an alcohol replacement because most people usually only drink alcohol at certain times or in certain settings anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“If it’s an occasional thing, there is flexibility,” Gearhardt says. Like we do with alcohol, set up “no soda zones,” such as your work area to reduce the number of hours and places you could potentially drink a soda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If you want to swap out soda at your next happy hour, check out &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/06/11/what-is-a-mocktail/84044261007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;mocktails&lt;/a&gt;, zero-proof &lt;a href="/story/money/2025/09/25/beer-companies-health-concerns-alcohol/86299088007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;beer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/story/news/health/2025/01/03/can-alcohol-cause-cancer-surgeon-general/77430536007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;wine&lt;/a&gt; or alcohol-free liquors, Temple says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;If you can't quit soda...&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When in doubt, Gearhardt says use your common sense: What is the lowest-sugar option you have at any place and time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;And when stopping soda has you feeling down, Gearhardt says to remember this is about prioritizing wellbeing. It’s not “quitting,” she says, it’s “getting healthier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If you’re not ready to ditch soda altogether, that’s OK. Eliminating just one soda per day can make a major health impact, Temple says: “View it more like a treat than a daily habit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s50"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s75"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>USA Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQeEZ4cXZkUWVrU0czaXJEb252ZDFBM004UmdKVW1xYzl1bnp3dm5HTzZSd1BCVkIwelpPM3ZTQnM5NDNMSk82bzdZbi1nRF84UUhjZHFkcmtjbXViTVNsTzlSZ1A1Z3pBVmZUU1R0d0xSbXJNNldPU3RGQ0g1ekladl9LY2tSR2pneVR5NE5lNXdPOVc3Yks2ZDZFNkQ1dXBFazBibXdxSmg</guid></item><item><title>50岁以上的女性应该优先考虑长寿的5种补充剂- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/best-supplements-for-women-over-50-11860488</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As women get older, nutrient needs can change based on menopause, losing muscle and more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D, creatine and magnesium are a few of the recommended supplements for women. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lifestyle factors and diet make a big difference, like strength training, eating plants and sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Turning 50 is an exciting milestone. But it’s also a time when women start to notice physical changes in their body, whether it’s &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-eat-to-ease-menopause-symptoms-11837072" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;symptoms related to menopause&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-in-menopause-11723891" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;natural loss of muscle&lt;/a&gt; that comes with age. The good news is that although you can’t control getting older, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/blue-zones-healthy-habits-11791571" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;focusing on lifestyle changes&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/eating-changes-to-make-at-50-11757224" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;eating a nutritious diet&lt;/a&gt;, exercising, getting enough sleep and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7902105/stress-causing-inflammation-what-you-can-do-about-it/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;reducing stress&lt;/a&gt; can help minimize the negative side effects of age-related physical changes and help you live longer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Supplements may help too, according to emerging research. We asked experts which supplements women over 50 should consider taking. Here are the top five supplements they recommend and why. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-vitamin-d"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 1. Vitamin D &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Vitamin D is essential for bone strength, mood balance and immune health,” says &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionbybess.com/old-about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Bess Berger, RDN, CDN, CLT&lt;/a&gt;. It’s found in fatty fish and fortified milks and cereals, but it can be hard to get enough through food. Plus, you can only make it from sun exposure from late spring to early fall, says &lt;a href="https://lifestylemedicine.stanford.edu/lifestyle-team/bio-pojednic/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Rachele Pojednic, Ph.D., Ed.M.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Why is vitamin D important over the age of 50? As women age, they lose bone mass. “Once women enter their 40s, bone loss starts to happen faster than we can create new bone,” says &lt;a href="https://jordanlanghough.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jordan Langhough, RD, CPT&lt;/a&gt;. During perimenopause and menopause, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-keep-your-bones-strong-after-menopause-with-nutrition-11841357" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;bone loss accelerates&lt;/a&gt; even more due to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/reasons-you-gain-weight-during-menopause-11846767" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;declining estrogen levels&lt;/a&gt; and reduced calcium absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Vitamin D is needed to help absorb calcium and keep bones strong as we age,” says Langhough.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But it’s not just for bones, says Pojednic. “Low vitamin D status in older women is also linked to weaker muscle function, greater risk of falls and sarcopenia,” she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In a systematic review conducted by Pojednic and her colleagues, vitamin D was shown to have beneficial effects on muscle strength and function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Ensuring sufficiency with supplementation is a sensible part of a muscle- and bone-focused healthy-aging strategy,” she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-creatine"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 2. Creatine &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-creatine-bad-for-you-11806099" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Creatine isn’t just for athletes&lt;/a&gt;. It’s one of the best-kept secrets for healthy aging and women who want to stay active, independent and strong well into later life, says Berger. “Creatine supports energy production in muscle cells, helping preserve strength, bone health and even mental clarity,” she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Women lose 3% to 5% of muscle every decade, starting at the age of 30,” says Pojednic. While strength training is most important to combat this loss, creatine can also help. “Supplementing with about 3 to 5 grams per day of creatine monohydrate in conjunction with resistance training has been shown to help preserve muscle, improve strength and support bone-health outcomes,” says Pojednic.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Even more, research shows that creatine can enhance the benefits of resistance training and reduce fatigue after workouts, says Berger.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s also exciting research emerging around &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/brain-benefits-of-creatine-11838817" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;creatine and brain health&lt;/a&gt;. “Often known for its benefits to muscle recovery, creatine acts as an energy buffer for brain cells and restocks ATP, which was shown to improve memory, cognitive functioning and attention span,” says &lt;a href="https://healthyjasmine.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jasmine Jafferali, M.P.H.&lt;/a&gt; One study found that women in perimenopause or menopause who took creatine hydrochloride for eight weeks had faster reaction times and less severe mood swings compared to a placebo.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Creatine monohydrate, the more widely available form, has similar positive effects on memory, attention and processing speed time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-magnesium"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 3. Magnesium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-11836271" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Magnesium is having a moment&lt;/a&gt;, and for good reason. “Along with playing a role in more than 300 chemical reactions in the body and helping regulate blood sugar levels, studies show that magnesium may be effective for managing stress and anxiety, as well as reducing brain fog,” says Jafferali. The average age of menopause in the United States is 52, so many women in their 50s may be struggling with these symptoms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research shows an interesting correlation between magnesium and stress where stress can deplete magnesium, and low magnesium can increase susceptibility to stress—creating a vicious cycle.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Things like stress, sugar, caffeine and other stimulants often deplete magnesium from the body and it is often hard to get it from foods,” says Jafferali. If you don’t eat lots of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-magnesium-rich-foods-11772823" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;, like nuts, seeds and seafood, you may want to consider a supplement.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-nicotinamide-riboside"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 4. Nicotinamide Riboside &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Nicotinamide riboside helps replenish NAD+, a critical coenzyme that declines with age,” says &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/about-1" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., RDN, LDN, CLEC, CPT&lt;/a&gt;. NAD+ is a derivative of vitamin B3 (niacin). “It’s essential for cellular energy production and DNA repair, both of which are vital for maintaining energy levels, supporting healthy aging and promoting overall cellular resilience,” says Manaker. But NAD+ isn’t bioavailable, so the best way to boost it is to take the precursor, nicotinamide riboside. “By supporting healthy NAD+ levels, nicotinamide riboside can help combat the effects of aging, such as increased cellular stress and inflammation, which are linked to reduced vitality and age-related health concerns,” says Manaker.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-b-complex"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 5. B-Complex  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-vitamin-b-complex-8669791" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;B vitamins are crucial&lt;/a&gt; for energy, brain function and metabolism, but absorption often declines with age, says Berger. “Women over 50 are especially at risk for low B12 and folate, which can lead to fatigue, brain fog or even mood changes,” she says. Berger recommends a balanced B-complex vitamin with active forms like methylfolate and methylcobalamin for better absorption. “It’s a simple way to boost daily vitality, especially for those taking medications or under chronic stress, which can further deplete these key nutrients,” she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-longevity-tips"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Other Longevity Tips &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Supplements should be just that: supplemental to lifestyle changes. Here are the top habits to focus on for health and longevity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move Your Body Daily: &lt;/strong&gt;Being sedentary is linked to an increased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But swapping sitting for steps could lower your risk of dying early from any condition. Studies show that the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8039177/walking-once-per-week-health-benefits-new-research/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;optimal amount is around 7,000-8,000 steps&lt;/a&gt; per day, but even 2,600 steps per day provided health benefits compared to 2,000, in one study.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The takeaway? Every step counts. And if you want to do something more vigorous, go for it. More-intense exercise may be even better for longevity, according to research.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lift Weights: &lt;/strong&gt;Strength training is associated with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/these-3-healthy-habits-could-help-you-live-to-100-8668458" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;living longer and better quality of life&lt;/a&gt; as you age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s because lifting weights increases muscle mass and strength, which reduces the risk of sarcopenia and its consequences like fractures and falls. It also makes daily tasks like carrying groceries easier and can help with weight management. So how often do you have to do it? Just twice per week can offer these benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, one interesting study found that 90 minutes of strength training per week slowed biological aging by almost four years.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat More Plant-Based Foods: &lt;/strong&gt;Consuming a mostly plant-based diet is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/5-foods-longevity-study-11687926" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;linked to living longer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, one study found that switching from a typical American diet to a plant-based diet around the age of 20 could add 10 years to a woman’s life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But it’s never too late, to reduce your intake of meat and pick up more produce at the store. Diets rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes and plant-based proteins &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-fight-inflammation-11762781" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and are associated with a lower risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes and cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Your Zzz’s: &lt;/strong&gt;Too little sleep is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/irregular-circadian-rhythms-linked-to-heart-disease-8425247" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;linked with chronic conditions&lt;/a&gt; like heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some cancers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Lack of sleep also impairs mood and concentration. On the flip side, women who get both enough sleep and high-quality sleep live longer. During sleep, the body repairs cells, suppresses inflammation and keeps your immune system healthy. So what’s the sweet spot? Aim for seven to nine hours per night.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And try to stay consistent with what time you go to bed and wake up: this is referred to as sleep regularity, and one study found that it was more important than getting enough sleep for longevity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Stress: &lt;/strong&gt;Chronic stress is linked to an increased risk of conditions like heart disease and depression. Stress also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/endurance-exercise-anti-aging-benefits-new-research-8363872" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt;speeds up cellular aging&lt;/a&gt; and can shorten telomeres, which cap the end of chromosomes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Shorter telomeres are associated with a shorter lifespan.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The good news is that this can somewhat be mitigated by making healthy lifestyle changes, like strength training. But the most important thing you can do for stress is manage it through techniques like breathing, meditation or therapy.&lt;/li&gt;

Kennedy at the helm of the US Department of Health and Human Services, the federal government has been &lt;a href="/podcasts/462402/rfk-jr-childhood-vaccine-schedule-advisory-committee-immunization-practices"&gt;casting doubt&lt;/a&gt; on the value of vaccines in the months leading up to virus season. Even though his department did approve a new flu vaccine for this year, his advisers also &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/rfk-jr-s-vaccine-committee-to-vote-on-flu-shots-and-preservative-thimerosal"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; removing certain ingredients from flu shots, even though those materials are not used in the vast majority of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst6"&gt;&lt;ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1agbrixi _739u100 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The federal government is not going to be a reliable ally during this year’s cold and flu season, having already taken steps to undermine trust in both the Covid and flu vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;You can protect yourself this winter — but you’ll have to do it yourself, in cooperation with the people close to you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Think about your own risk and how much risk you’re willing to tolerate, communicate clearly with friends and family about your approach, and keep a close eye on your local situation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;They have also &lt;a href="/health/460528/vaccine-recommendations-rfk-hhs-new-guidance-covid"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; any specific recommendations for the Covid vaccinations and, instead, told people to depend on “individual decision making.” On the cusp of flu activity picking up in the US, a top Food and Drug Administration official is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/29/fda-vaccine-approval-child-covid-deaths/"&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; that the vaccine process should be overhauled because it is not sufficient, while making unsubstantiated claims that the Covid shots have killed a small number of children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And now, the forecast for the next few months is getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Not only is there disarray among public health authorities, but this year’s cold and flu season is looking to be especially bad. That is partly bad luck; developing a new flu shot every year is always a guessing game, and this year’s shot is &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/absent-cdc-and-mismatched-subclade-k-flu-strain-experts-face-upcoming-season"&gt;not very well matched&lt;/a&gt; to the most widespread flu strains. But, it’s also partly a matter of choice, a consequence of the anti-public health mania Kennedy has helped stoke. The number of flu vaccinations administered between August and October &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/18/health/new-flu-variant-subclade-k?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-90CEPo7LTAmN5x15eEfmmRynhCyV3GbnUtBeq6U-L1vRIAoTXov57Ts4wY6WY3-o8GR_b8kMfz2v5_S2NxAyVjKgsTDQ&amp;amp;_hsmi=390652300&amp;amp;utm_content=390652300&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;was the lowest&lt;/a&gt; in the past six years. The number of Covid boosters available to the public has been steadily dropping with each new shot, and now, Kennedy Jr.’s health department has decided to limit access. Less than 15 percent of US adults &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/vaccination-trends.html#:~:text=21%2C%202025-,About,with%20a%20health%20care%20provider."&gt;have received&lt;/a&gt; a Covid booster this year, including less than 1 in 3 seniors over 65. New RSV vaccines for infants &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/respiratory-syncytial-virus-rsv/study-finds-low-varied-rsv-monoclonal-and-maternal-vaccination#:~:text=State%20variations%2C%20timing%20tracking,improvements%20as%20the%20season%20progressed."&gt;have had discouragingly low uptake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This winter, more than ever, we are all on our own in combating flu, cold, RSV, and Covid-19. The federal government is no longer a reliable ally, because it has shown, with Kennedy leading the charge, that it will &lt;a href="/health/459768/trump-cdc-director-monarez-robert-kennedy-jr"&gt;routinely ignore established science&lt;/a&gt;. The medical community is scrambling to fill the void, but the fundamental challenge is that many people, not only within Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again movement but across the political spectrum, no longer trust the experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In this new reality, not everyone will be on the same page. Some people may choose to take no precautions at all, even as cases rise. But, you do have agency to protect your personal well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="public-health-is-out-for-now-were-in-a-new-era-of-diy-health" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;“Public” health is out for now. We’re in a new era of DIY health.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For a long time, public health was embraced by the public. It had stacked up wins over the decades: eradicating polio and smallpox in the 20th century and measles at the turn of the 21st. Diseases that had killed millions over millennia were relegated to the past as better sanitation, vaccinations, and greater awareness — the bedrock of the public health playbook — became woven into everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As recently as a decade ago, the people who opposed vaccinations and other public health interventions remained well outside of the mainstream. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. himself was, before the start of the Covid pandemic, a marginal figure who spewed conspiracy theories about vaccines and autism. Even Trump kept his distance from Kennedy during his first term, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-trump-rfk-jr-vaccine-panel-book-2025-10"&gt;reportedly at the urging of Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt;, despite his own past flirtations with anti-vaccine rhetoric. And while Kennedy’s influence and the work of other anti-vaccine activists may have chipped away at the public’s belief in vaccinations, they had limited success. Most Americans still thought getting their annual shots was a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But, we live in a different reality now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Two decades ago, 94 percent of Americans believed it was extremely or very important to get children vaccinated — near unanimity, according to &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx"&gt;Gallup&lt;/a&gt;. In 2025, just 69 percent still agree. In &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/quick-take/challenges-for-rebuilding-trust-in-the-cdc/#:~:text=Last%20week%2C%20CDC%20director%20Susan,trust%20among%20partisans%20going%20forward."&gt;March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, 85 percent of Americans trusted the CDC to provide reliable information about vaccines, per KFF polling. By &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-tylenol-autism-link-and-vaccine-policies/"&gt;October 2025&lt;/a&gt;, that share had fallen to 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When the worst measles outbreak in years &lt;a href="/vaccines/411756/us-measles-outbreak-cases-deaths-charts"&gt;took hold&lt;/a&gt; in West Texas earlier this year, local health officials were &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-government-pulls-back-over-11-billion-funding-state-health-departments-2025-03-26/"&gt;losing their federal funding&lt;/a&gt; and getting limited support at best from the CDC while Kennedy waffled on the value of vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/05/health/measles-rfk-vitamin-a-misinformation"&gt;embraced&lt;/a&gt; unproven treatments such as cod liver oil. As Milwaukee contended with a lead poisoning crisis in its school buildings, its residents had no one in Washington to call, because the relevant team &lt;a href="/public-health/413352/donald-trump-rfk-milwaukee-schools-lead-poisoning"&gt;had been fired&lt;/a&gt;. Whooping cough is back and worse than it’s been in years as vaccination rates fall. Kennedy has been mum on the issue, despite &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5501601-cassidy-kennedy-whooping-cough-louisiana/"&gt;pleas&lt;/a&gt; from Republican senators to weigh in publicly and affirm the value of the whooping cough vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We’re a deeply divided country, specifically on the subject of &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; health. And that means a lot of your neighbors aren’t going to take precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="heres-how-you-can-navigate-this-sickness-season-in-these-unusual-times" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Here’s how you can navigate this sickness season in these unusual times&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you are concerned about your &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt; health, what do you do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Let’s start by talking about risk. Much of the backlash to the various pandemic interventions — things like masking and issuing vaccine mandates — was founded in different people’s differing risk assessments and risk tolerance. You would hear it all the time from the opponents of those measures: Why should a young man with no serious health problems be &lt;em&gt;required &lt;/em&gt;to get a shot? Many people today find the traditional public health argument — because he might unwittingly pass it along to another person who is more vulnerable — unpersuasive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And, to be fair, it is true that certain people &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have a much higher risk of Covid, or flu, or RSV than others do — and their choices and behaviors during what most of us call the cold and flu season can reasonably differ. No two people are exactly alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That is simply the reality we are living in: individual health, not public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So, your seasonal strategy should start with assessing your own risk. If you are 25 years old with no children and minimal exposure to the elderly, you may decide it’s reasonable to take chances on, for example, going out in public when flu activity is high in your area. If you’re a 65-year-old with a chronic health condition or a compromised immune system, you might not be willing to take the same risks; at least, you might want to think about wearing a mask if there are a lot of Covid or RSV cases in your community. If you are, like me, the 38-year-old parent of three, you might fall somewhere in between the two poles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Think about your own situation and the people you come into contact with every day and use that as a guide by which you can evaluate your risk and make decisions. Get on the same page with the people in your life you see regularly: your family, friends and coworkers. You don’t have to completely agree on your risk tolerance to be open and transparent about your mindset as we head into the season. If there are certain dealbreakers — like, &lt;em&gt;I don’t want you to come to my house if you have a runny nose or fever&lt;/em&gt; — talk about how you’ll handle those situations in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;From that baseline, you need reliable information as the winter goes on and viral activity starts to pick up. Start local. Most people &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-tylenol-autism-link-and-vaccine-policies/"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; they have much more trust in their personal doctor than they do in major medical organizations, including the CDC. If you have a primary care doctor, or you can find one, they will be a reliable source whom you can speak to face to face or over a telehealth call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you don’t have a primary physician, or you simply want to educate yourself on what leading medical authorities are saying, you can check out the recommended vaccinations for children under 18 from &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP-Immunization-Schedule.pdf"&gt;the American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;. Different state groups — one on &lt;a href="https://sharedsystems.dhsoha.state.or.us/DHSForms/Served/le-1157350.pdf"&gt;the West Coast&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2025/09/nephc-covid-19-vaccine-consensus-recommendation-final-to-leadership-9_15_2025.pdf"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt; — are issuing their own vaccine recommendations for adults. The West Coast Health Alliance, for example, advises all adults over 65 to get a Covid shot, people under 65 with certain risk factors, and all adults who are in contact with high-risk patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Your insurance coverage could be different this year, too, after the changes to vaccine guidance made by the Trump administration. Kennedy’s health department has scaled back the official government vaccine guidance to “individual decision making” — once again, you’re on your own — and that could affect some insurers’ willingness to cover the cost of a Covid shot. You could call your health plan in advance to find out if it will be covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And otherwise, keep an eye on what’s happening in your community. State governments often publish infectious disease dashboards with up-to-date data, and local health departments usually send out advisories when local case loads are high. I live in Ohio, and &lt;a href="https://data.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/data/view/summary-of-infectious-diseases-in-ohio"&gt;here’s what my local source looks like&lt;/a&gt;. Resources like this will help you understand the specifics of how illnesses are moving through your own community so that you can then weigh your risk and — if you choose — adjust your behavior accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;You can still build a disease-resilient community this winter.

&lt;p&gt;South Korean scientists recently determined that patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS) showed approximately double the Parkinson’s disease incidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that doesn’t sound like good news, it’s because you haven’t heard what they found next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Korea University Ansan Hospital and collaborators then found that among those RLS patients, those who were treated with a recently-developed dopamine agonist treatment experienced a protective buffer against Parkinson’s disease onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were gathered from a nationwide cohort of nearly 20,000 people, involved Ansan Hospital, Pohang Stroke and Spine Hospital, and National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital, and were &lt;a href="https://medicine.korea.ac.kr/en/research/research/view.do?articleNo=55526" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; online in the journal JAMA Network Open on October 6th, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological sleep disorder characterized by an uncontrollable urge to move the legs, often worsening at night. Parkinson’s disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is marked by tremor, rigidity, and slowed movement. Both conditions are associated with dysfunction in the brain’s dopaminergic system, but their causal relationship has remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This retrospective cohort study, led by Professor Jong Hun Kim from the Department of Neurology, Ansan Hospital, analyzed data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service Sample Cohort (2002–2019). The researchers identified 9,919 individuals with RLS and compared them with an equal number of matched controls without the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a median follow-up of 15 years, Parkinson’s developed in 1.6% of RLS patients compared with 1.0% of controls, confirming a heightened risk. When analyzed by treatment status, the results revealed a striking divergence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with untreated RLS showed the highest Parkinson’s incidence (2.1%) and an earlier onset of the disease, whereas patients given a dopamine agonist treatment showed a markedly lower Parkinson’s incidence (0.5%) and a delayed onset compared with controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings indicate the existence of ‘heterogeneity within RLS’ which allows for multiple interpretations,” Professor Kim explained. “One of the interpretations is that restless legs syndrome may serve as an early clinical marker for Parkinson’s disease, particularly among untreated individuals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOUTH KOREAN STORIES: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our results also indicate that dopamine therapy, used for symptom control, may confer protective benefits to the brain’s motor pathways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To strengthen the validity of their conclusions, the team employed target-trial emulation methods, an advanced analytical approach that reduces bias in observational research. This methodological rigor reinforces the biological plausibility of a link between RLS and PD rather than a mere overlap in symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PARKINSON’S &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors propose that beyond dopamine dysfunction, other factors—such as sleep disruption, iron deficiency, and immune or metabolic pathways—may mediate this association. The protective trend observed with dopamine therapy could reflect neuroprotective mechanisms or improved identification of genuine RLS cases that are distinct from early-stage Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This dual pattern underscores the importance of recognizing and managing restless legs syndrome early,” adds Professor Kim. “Monitoring and treating RLS may not only improve sleep quality but could also influence long-term neurological health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHARE This Story With Anyone You Know With RLS, It Could Save Their Brains…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Probably later than you think. According to &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-025-65974-8" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a recent study published in the journal Nature Communications" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-025-65974-8" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;a recent study published in the journal Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, when it comes to brain functionality, adulthood starts at 32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. The findings show that the human brain has five phases throughout a lifespan, and researchers say they are all broken up by age — 9, 32, 66 and 83, on average. Researchers referred to these ages as “turning points” when the brain rewires and goes through age-related changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The childhood brain, a time of high growth, lasts through roughly age 9, when it then changes to the adolescent brain, which continues until 32. Yes, 32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that someone who is in the later part of this adolescent brain phase is going to act like a teenager, Dr. Alexa Mousley, the study leader, told &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/nov/25/brain-human-cognitive-development-life-stages-cambridge-study" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="The Guardian" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/nov/25/brain-human-cognitive-development-life-stages-cambridge-study" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it means their brains simply resemble each other as they continue to grow and form until the adult brain phase is reached. This adolescent brain phase is the only time when brain efficiency is consistently increasing, &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/five-ages-human-brain" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="study authors said" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/five-ages-human-brain" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;study authors said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age 32 also marks the “strongest shift” of all of the brain changes. Around this time, the brain goes into its adult era ― the longest phase ― which lasts until roughly age 66. During the adult era, or adult “epoch” as researchers call these phases, there is a “plateau in intelligence and personality,” the study &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/five-ages-human-brain" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="press release states" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/five-ages-human-brain" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;press release states&lt;/a&gt;. Meaning, brain function stays pretty much the same for these decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 66, the brain changes, and it moves into the “early aging” phase, which does not have dramatic changes, but the brain does show “further reduced connectivity as white matter starts to degenerate,” Mousley said in a press release. This aligns with the physical health issues that often start to appear in the 60s, Mousley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an age when people face increased risk for a variety of health conditions that can affect the brain, such as hypertension,” Mousley said in the statement. Hypertension (also known as high blood pressure) can put you at higher risk of stroke and &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/high-blood-pressure-linked-cognitive-decline" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="cognitive decline." data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/high-blood-pressure-linked-cognitive-decline" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;cognitive decline.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final epoch starts at 83 and is known as “late aging,” which is a time when brain connectivity reduces and there is more reliance on specific regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To gather this data, researchers looked at a number of factors, including brain compartmentalization, along with the changes and deterioration of the nerve fibers in the brains of 3,802 people ages 0 to 90 via data from MRI scans. All participants were described as “neurotypical.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study does have limitations. The late-aging group of people was smaller than the other groups. More, participants in all groups had to meet certain health criteria, which may make them healthier than the general public. This could mean that study participants’ brain functionality may be more optimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Jose Luis Pelaez via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jose Luis Pelaez via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The brain does not reach adulthood until about age 32, according to a new study.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain changes are inevitable as you age, but there are things you can do to keep your brain healthy. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain health is a major concern for people as they grow older, especially with more than &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-future-burden-dementia-united-states" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="6 million Americans" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-future-burden-dementia-united-states" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;6 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; having a dementia diagnosis. &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/forgetfulness-7-types-of-normal-memory-problems" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Forgetting things here and there" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/forgetfulness-7-types-of-normal-memory-problems" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Forgetting things here and there&lt;/a&gt; is no major cause for concern as you get older, but if those memory issues disrupt your life, you should talk to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are things you can do to help keep your brain as optimal as possible throughout your lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy habits, overall, &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.gov/life-with-dementia/can-i-prevent-dementia" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="can help reduce dementia risk factors" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.alzheimers.gov/life-with-dementia/can-i-prevent-dementia" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;can help reduce dementia risk factors&lt;/a&gt;.

Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows norovirus cases have doubled over the past few weeks, with positive tests surging from seven percent in August to 14 percent in mid-November. The spike has arrived earlier than anticipated and during a surge in other respiratory illnesses, including COVID, whooping cough, and seasonal flu. Norovirus causes acute gastroenteritis, leading to severe vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach pain, the CDC warns. About 20 million people contract the disease each year, and while most victims recover in one to three days, the illness can lead to severe infections amongst children and older adults. There is no cure for norovirus, but health officials recommend stopping its spread by washing hands, cleaning and disinfecting surfaces, and properly washing vegetables and shellfish before eating them. Those with the disease are advised to rest, drink electrolyte-containing fluids, and eat bland foods. The highest recorded month for Norovirus cases was December 2024, when 25 percent of tests for the disease came back positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="read-it-at-btn" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/12/03/norovirus-winter-vomiting-disease-bug-symptoms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Read it at &lt;span&gt;Axios&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Daily Beast</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 11:46:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxPQnM4ZHQ3RmxtZmZwN1AzTHJwX3g0UlVzQnFUM3Rhc25PRmpkdEMyMVRUOWk0MVAtdTZuLWJIMlE4aXBkVEhCY3JUNS1rMmJtOVM3NEgwNGR5TGJyUzBwNzdjRUs0dHF4SlRJSUpZQ0MzQmlIc2wzTENnRW1QV1QwZHlqRnhoLTlMOXRjZlJlVQ</guid></item><item><title>芬太尼疫苗即将进行首次重大测试- WIRED</title><link>https://www.wired.com/story/a-fentanyl-vaccine-is-about-to-get-its-first-major-test/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;Just a tiny&lt;/span&gt; amount of fentanyl, the equivalent of a few grains of sand, is enough to stop a person’s breathing. The &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/a-new-type-of-opioid-is-killing-people-in-the-us-europe-and-australia/"&gt;synthetic opioid&lt;/a&gt; is tasteless, odorless, and invisible when mixed with other substances, and drug users are often unaware of its presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;It’s why biotech entrepreneur Collin Gage is aiming to protect people against the drug’s lethal effects. In 2023, he became the cofounder and CEO of ARMR Sciences to develop a vaccine against fentanyl. Now, the company is launching a trial to test its vaccine in people for the first time. The goal: prevent deaths from overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“It became very apparent to me that as I assessed the treatment landscape, everything that exists is reactionary,” Gage says. “I thought, why are we not preventing this?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Fifty times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine, fentanyl was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as an intravenous pain reliever and anesthetic. Its potential for abuse was &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526590014009055"&gt;recognized even then&lt;/a&gt;, and clinicians could get it only in combination with the sedative droperidol in a ratio of 50:1 droperidol to fentanyl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Cheap to make and incredibly addictive, fentanyl is now found in street drugs and counterfeit pills, because it boosts their potency and cuts costs. The drug is the biggest driver of overdose deaths in the United States and the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Naloxone, known by the brand name Narcan, can rapidly reverse overdoses caused by fentanyl and other opioids. Widespread distribution of the medication contributed to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-reports-decline-in-us-drug-overdose-deaths.html"&gt;24 percent decline&lt;/a&gt; in US drug overdose deaths in 2024. It works by attaching to opioid receptors throughout the body and displacing the opioid molecules that are attached there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;But a vaccine like the one ARMR Sciences is developing would be given before a person even encounters the drug. Gage likens it to a bulletproof vest or a suit of armor—hence the company’s name. (It was previously registered as Ovax but switched names in January.) “This is something that could completely change the paradigm of how we deal with overdose, because it doesn’t require someone to be carrying the treatment on them,” Gage says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Opioid vaccines were initially proposed in the 1970s, but after early attempts at heroin vaccines failed, much of the research was abandoned. The modern opioid epidemic has led to a resurgence of interest, with &lt;a href="https://heal.nih.gov/about/research-plan"&gt;backing from the US government&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxNZGVjME9BRk9LclB1ZjMwcUtWcDJiZkNSd212Z2dUUE9obDFsNmUtVWMxU1JuMkdVZk1TM0tMMWJkdHQ1Vm92NXlVY1dROFBZQUh3dmtUUy02c2RlZl90eWNlT3Q1UjhFd2xsR3BPZVFmUkR0OFZIRDdDQ0p2dHpFX0pUdHQ1dXNNNTN1eg</guid></item><item><title>当地兽医讨论可能对当地马匹构成危险的病毒- KTLO</title><link>https://www.ktlo.com/2025/12/03/local-veterinarian-discusses-virus-that-could-pose-danger-to-area-horses/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KTLO</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 11:21:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOZ0FSSG9uOXlxc0hDNlVQR3ZTTG5CUFpVcGItd0xQX1BWQ1RqZTdJbThCNG02SGlpdVhqcUFqb0hvX1RSYUc5MXZIRmw3WG1JZXEyX0FjdVJQMVdnaU5oY2taOV8zeXdFblhGU1M0Nlc1MnhHcFlEVkY0RVJic09ua2dBbUVqRFc0QzlQNy1uZnZEb0c0cS1fSEdaUVVYUlFqZ1FWZFNtaWU</guid></item><item><title>前疾控中心官员辞职后返回当地医疗保健- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/03/former-cdc-official-public-health-failing-demetre-daskalakis-interview/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demetre Daskalakis likens his former colleagues at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to “hostages.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They’re sitting there doing their work — they’re creating presentations, they’re analyzing data, they’re doing the surveillance,” said Daskalakis, a former top official at the CDC who &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/profiles-cdc-officials-who-resigned-in-protest/"&gt;resigned&lt;/a&gt; this summer along with two other leaders. “But then you have someone above who is making sweeping decisions without process and putting them on the CDC website as if they were gospel truth.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That was a reference to the agency, at the direction of health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., recently &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/20/cdc-vaccine-safety-website-promotes-debunked-autism-link/"&gt;reversing its stance&lt;/a&gt; that vaccines don’t cause autism, a move that Daskalakis said would have caused him to quit if he hadn’t already. He was with the agency for more than four years, beginning in the last days of the first Trump administration as the director of the Division of HIV Prevention. In 2022, he helped lead the White House’s mpox response. By the second Trump administration, he was serving as the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite Kennedy’s long record of anti-vaccine rhetoric, Daskalakis was initially &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/29/podcasts/the-daily/cdc-vaccine-daskalakis.html?showTranscript=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;optimistic&lt;/a&gt; about the potential for good public health policy. The feeling didn’t last. As Kennedy led mass layoffs and began making unilateral decisions — &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/09/rfk-jr-fires-every-member-of-cdc-vaccine-expert-panel-acip/"&gt;firing&lt;/a&gt; an entire vaccine advisory panel, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/15/kennedy-names-new-acip-members-cdc-vaccine-advisers/"&gt;handpicking&lt;/a&gt; the new members, changing Covid-19 shot &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/27/covid-shots-pregnant-women-children-recommendation-change-hhs-secretary-kennedy/"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; — Daskalakis grew to believe science was being superseded by ideology. He began compiling a list of reasons that made it hard to stay in the job. The final straw wasn’t the shooting on CDC campus in early August, which sent bullets directly through his own unoccupied office windows. It was later that month, after the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/cdc-director-fired-behind-the-scenes-look/"&gt;ousting&lt;/a&gt; of then-Director Susan Monarez. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Enough is enough,” he wrote in his resignation letter, citing Kennedy’s undermining of the agency and vaccine policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now Daskalakis, an infectious disease physician, is taking his skills back to the city where they were honed working in HIV clinics and as deputy commissioner of the New York City health department. Starting in February, he’ll serve as the chief medical officer of the Callen-Lorde Community Health Center, the LGBTQ+ clinic announced Wednesday. He’ll also serve on the transition team for incoming New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As long as there’s a will to destroy public health, it’s going to be really hard to fix it,” Daskalakis said in an interview about his decision to move on from the CDC. “I feel more confident that my ability to help the community is best served closer to the ground.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daskalakis spoke to STAT about the importance of local health, how he decided to leave the federal government, and what he thinks about Kennedy’s latest moves. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re taking on the role of CMO at Callen-Lorde Community Health Center, and you’re also one of a couple dozen people on the health committee within Zohran Mamdani’s transition team. I’m struck by how locally focused both these positions are. What made you interested in these roles after leaving your position at the CDC?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My career has taken me from local to federal. I started really doing clinical work in New York City, and learned to do public health as an attending physician at Bellevue Hospital. Then I moved to the Department of Health in New York City and then over to CDC. As I learned more from the local, it became important for me to go to the place [CDC] where that local experience would influence the direction that public health went nationally and, frankly, globally. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an environment where I really don’t think that federal public health is able to actually execute on its mission, this is when it’s time to go back to local. For me, the opportunity to go back to New York City and back to the grassroots front line is extremely appealing. It becomes a local charge to have to execute on the public health mission. And I believe in the work that Callen-Lorde does — LGBTQ work has been at the core of my career in so many different things that I do. And New York City — though I was born in D.C. — is where I grew up from the perspective of my own social awareness as well as public health. And so all of it made sense to go back to my roots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you talk about what your work will look like in each of these roles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We haven’t had our first health subcommittee meeting [for Mamdani], so I will know more when we go. … We’re going to give him the advice that he needs to be able to move forward with a very strong health agenda. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chief medical officer at Callen-Lorde, that’s literally going back to my clinical roots, but also my community roots, so it sort of blends the two. I’ve always seen patients, no matter where I’ve been. When I was running parts of the [New York] Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, I was seeing patients at Mount Sinai. When I was working at CDC, I was seeing patients at Grady Hospital, at the Ponce clinic. So I will be seeing patients at Callen-Lorde, which is exciting. And then as the chief medical officer, I think my job is going to be making sure that the science and the operations are working together in a way that really provides the highest level of care and services to the LGBTQ+ population in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the things that’s great about not being at the federal government anymore, is that I’m able to comment on mis- and disinformation. Rather than misinformation, it’s really a lot of distortion. As a physician, as a clinician, and as someone who’s been a public health expert, I feel like my role is to continue to differentiate signal from noise. That’s part of what I’m going to be doing at Callen-Lorde for the community. It’s important for physicians to speak out, and medical providers to speak out, especially when they’re seeing things that are potentially bad for their patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many children’s hospitals have stopped providing gender-affirming care to young people as the Trump administration threatens federal funding — even community health systems similar to Callen-Lorde, like &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/10/15/fenway-health-halts-gender-affirming-care-for-patients-under-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fenway Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; in Boston. What’s the impact for young patients when that care is removed? And are you worried that Callen-Lorde may make a similar decision at some point? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the base, medical decisions should really be between patients, their families, and medical providers, and should be based on science and free of partisan politics. New York is the right place to be to make sure that we can continue to deliver on that mission. And so that’s why I’m excited to go. Is it going to be simple? No, it’s going to be really complicated. But I’ve never shied away from complexity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where there’s risk — that’s a place that I really like to work. And so, do I think that the answer is going to be straightforward for Callen-Lorde? No. But what I do know is that they have a legacy of delivering on the mission to serve their community, and so I’m going to be a part of that legacy. I do have all of the appropriate concerns that I think everyone should have in health care right now, because the current regime over health in America is making bad decisions based on ideology. But I also have faith in the leaders of Callen-Lorde, faith in New York City, and then, frankly, the experience to be able to navigate some potentially turbulent waters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You left the CDC in late August when Susan Monarez was ousted from her role as director. Can you walk me through how you made that decision? What factors were you weighing, and was there anything that gave you pause?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My doctor gene is really strong with this one. My main acid test … was if I felt that I was somehow going to do more harm than good. My oath to first do no harm is something that I took very seriously. And as I saw science being sidelined, and ideology not based in science becoming the communication strategy of CDC, I really couldn’t stay there and have my powers be used for evil instead of good, right? Being there as sort of a leader and allowing things like the autism website to go up — I would have quit then as well. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, my &lt;a href="https://x.com/dr_demetre/status/1960843433473376602" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;resignation letter&lt;/a&gt; was not something I wrote in 10 minutes. I’d been compiling a list of the things that were making it hard for me to stay. But each of the things that I listed before the last one were things that we were able to mitigate. When [Kennedy] announced that there was going to be a change to the Covid vaccine schedule for kids and pregnant women, we mitigated the harm of that by working to create the shared clinical decision-making. And frankly, [the administration] is sloppy. So seemingly, they said a [Covid] vaccine shouldn’t be given to a pregnant woman, but then they also said that pregnancy was a risk factor. So that allowed some wiggle where that wasn’t the end of the world. But when it was clear that they were just going to put up conspiracy theories, have presentations that had nothing to do with data that was at all reviewed, that was the end for me, because I couldn’t just sit there and watch. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’m sure eventually I would have been fired. But I took the perspective … that my voice is really important in making sure that people know what’s happening. And so I elected to resign without a job, without a prospect for what was next, which really let me share what the inside was like.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have there been any moments since leaving the agency that you regretted it, or where you felt like, if you were still there, you could have stopped something that wasn’t based on sound science from happening? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why I left, because I found that there was no way to mitigate, because they were circumventing all of it. Let’s go over what happened with the website for autism and vaccines. The scientists were not involved with putting that up. They went around the scientists and they went to the web team and said post it. And so that would have been under my watch. And so rather than regret or going, “Oh, I could have helped fix it,” unfortunately, more than anything, I go into the “I told you so” zone. Because I do feel like as long as there’s a will to destroy public health, it’s going to be really hard to fix it. There’s this ongoing will to try to destabilize it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I really feel badly for the folks who are still there and they’re heroes for hanging in, but I’m sure all of them are thinking, “where’s my line?” And I think that’s a decision that you have to make for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

It’s science,” she says during the spot. “After kids, it’s the medicine my body needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;• Patients should be eating a protein-rich, balanced diet and doing some kind of strength training when on an GLP-1 medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;• Some patients taking GLP-1 drugs have experienced significant muscle loss and weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;• Experts worry that too many patients may be trying to use GLP-1 drugs as a shortcut instead of improving their diet and exercise to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Here is one of the world’s greatest athletes, giving voice — in commercials running during primetime TV, on &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@todayshow/video/7541017696591252749"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt; show&lt;/a&gt;, and on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNnxUpiuZVs/?hl=en"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; — to a frustration that many people have felt. She gained weight after she had kids. And even though, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MAYscxxhDE"&gt;in her words&lt;/a&gt;, she was “doing everything right” after the pregnancy, she couldn’t cut as much weight as she liked. That’s where the GLP-1 drug came in and delivered results: Williams lost 31 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But there’s just one problem with the pitch: GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;, in some ways, a shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Americans always want the fucking pill,” Dr. Robert Lustig, a metabolic scientist at the University of California-San Francisco, told me. “I view GLP-1s like a Band-Aid. … There’s nothing wrong with a Band-Aid. But what if you didn’t clean your wound and you just put the Band-Aid on? The Band-Aid is necessary, but it’s not sufficient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The consequences of patients slapping on the Band-Aid — taking a GLP-1 — without treating the underlying issue with the kind of healthy eating and exercise that are still necessary even with these drugs is becoming clear. Scientists have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38937282/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that some GLP-1 patients can lose significant muscle mass, as well as a loss of functional strength, due to a lack of energy. Rather than feel fitter and ready to go out in the world or onto the tennis court, these are patients &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1msh9a5/anyone_experiencing_muscle_weakness_since_starting/"&gt;who find walking up the stairs to be almost debilitating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For this story, I sought to understand how this is playing out in American culture. In searching Reddit communities dedicated to GLP-1 drugs, I found lots of normal people whose experience backed up that research: They had long tried to lose weight but could never quite meet their goals — until they went on a GLP-1 drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But even as they lost weight, they didn’t feel better. Some of them felt worse, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1id8100/muscle_loss_weakness/"&gt;weaker&lt;/a&gt;. There are &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1msh9a5/anyone_experiencing_muscle_weakness_since_starting/"&gt;dozens&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1f56pry/losing_muscle_tone_everywhere_including_pelvic/"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; of GLP-1 patients &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1i3317w/losing_muscle_mass_like_crazy/"&gt;coming to their peers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1id8100/muscle_loss_weakness/"&gt;asking for advice about workouts&lt;/a&gt; they could do &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1f2o8pu/muscle_recovery/"&gt;to stem the muscle loss&lt;/a&gt;. A few &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1kop4w5/muscle/"&gt;hope to find the right diet&lt;/a&gt; that will allow them to feel energetic and avoid muscle loss while losing the weight — but without having to commit to strength training that needs to go along with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While the term “strength training” may conjure images of ripped bodybuilders, doctors increasingly emphasize the importance of muscle training for all of their patients, from the 30-year-old marathon runner to the 65-year-old retiree. That’s because research has shown that more &lt;a href="https://cospineandjoint.com/muscle-mass-fall-risk-research/"&gt;lean muscle helps you age better and protects against hazards, such as falls, that pose a greater and greater threat as you get older&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These drugs are already &lt;a href="/future-perfect/467025/ozempic-glp-1-drugs-obesity-weight-loss"&gt;wildly popular&lt;/a&gt;, and their use is likely to keep growing. In November, the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/06/health/obesity-drug-prices-trump.html"&gt;struck deals&lt;/a&gt; with Lilly and Novo Nordisk to lower the cash price of their drugs in exchange for expanded Medicare coverage. Those price changes, which will begin to take effect next year, could further grow the number of Americans taking these medications, including among seniors for whom &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/a-guide-to-combatting-sarcopenia-and-preserving-muscle-mass-as-you-get-older"&gt;any loss of muscle mass is a serious health concern&lt;/a&gt;. One quarter of &lt;a href="https://www.ispor.org/docs/default-source/cti-meeting-21021-documents/2258f380-ec14-4bf3-bc24-d6b1f4a0a272.pdf?sfvrsn=585565ec_0"&gt;GLP-1 prescriptions dispensed in 2024&lt;/a&gt; were for people older than 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Falls are already &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/new-old-age-paula-span-falls-mortality-death-older-people-prescription-drugs/"&gt;one of the most potent killers of older adults&lt;/a&gt;; more than 40,000 Americans over 65 died from falls in 2023, and the death rate has tripled since 1990. If more patients start taking semaglutide for its effects on cognition, for example, and fail to eat and exercise properly, they could experience malnourishment and significant muscle loss; both could put their long-term health at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That doesn’t mean GLP-1 drugs are a bad deal for public health. On the population level, obesity is &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/adult-overweight-obesity/health-risks"&gt;associated with a host of major ills&lt;/a&gt;, and Americans have long been desperate to lose weight. The class of drugs that includes Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and now countless others — Zepbound, compound GLP-1s, etc. — are the most impressive weight-loss tools we’ve ever seen. They work because they slow digestion and tell your brain you’re full, which makes it easier for people to eat less. While these treatments are still fairly new, observational studies have &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/health-rounds-patients-drop-fewer-pounds-with-weight-loss-drugs-real-world-than-2025-06-11/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that patients who stay on these drugs for a year or more can lose 10 percent of their body weight on average. And on the population level, obesity rates are &lt;a href="/future-perfect/467025/ozempic-glp-1-drugs-obesity-weight-loss"&gt;already starting to decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Scientists are also discovering that these drugs have amazing potential to treat a breadth of issues: from addressing &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/16/glp1-weight-loss-addiction-drug-alcohol/"&gt;substance-abuse disorders&lt;/a&gt;, lowering &lt;a href="https://www.biospace.com/drug-development/evidence-mounts-for-benefit-of-glp-1s-against-heart-disease"&gt;your risk for heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, and even potentially preventing &lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/news/2025/popular-diabetes-medications-may-protect-against-alzheimers-disease-uf-researchers-find#:~:text=The%20data%20showed%20a%20statistically,cognitive%20decline%20in%20Alzheimer%E2%80%99s%20patients."&gt;dementia and Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. Recent studies have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251112011810.htm"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that taking a GLP-1 like Wegovy or Ozempic is even associated with lower cancer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But to stem the risk of muscle-mass loss, you must also be willing to commit to improving your diet and adopting a serious workout regimen over the long term. GLP-1 drugs may be magical when it comes to weight loss, but they are not magic pills. Which means that along with the rise of Ozempic and other GLP-1s is a coming reckoning over America’s shortcut culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="is-this-just-a-necessary-evil-to-weight-loss" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;“Is this just a necessary evil to weight loss?”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Plenty of athletes who are not world-famous see the same appeal in GLP-1 drugs that Serena Williams did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One person in particular stood out to me. A self-identified weight lifter, CrossFit enthusiast, and horse rider, who I’ll call Sam, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1ju53r2/muscle_loss/"&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; their experience on Reddit. They explained they had always struggled to lose weight despite strict meal preparation and eating a lot of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And so, Sam started taking Wegovy. ”I’m happy with the results,” they said — before getting to a pretty big caveat for somebody who’s always had an active life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Despite aiming to eat 100 grams of protein every day, they said they were feeling weak. “I swear I can feel my muscle being broken down. Is this a thing??” Sam asked in the online forum. “I actually feel less firm, more wobbly and flabby. I seem to have less definition,“ they said. “Is this just a necessary evil to weight loss?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="why-i-reported-this-story" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 _1lbxzst3 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why I reported this story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;GLP-1 drugs are undeniably exciting, and they are being widely adopted. I recently found out a family member of my own had started taking them, and they’re not the kind of person who’s susceptible to diet fads either. As a reporter, that makes me nervous: Anything that sounds too good to be true probably is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;It would be wonderful if GLP-1 drugs could cure Alzheimer’s, but we probably need to think through the trade-offs. And I started to pick up from other reporting and social media feeds I follow that some people were experiencing this unexpected muscle loss. I thought it would be valuable to unpack the science to explain why this happens to some people and explain what they can do to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The internet is filled with examples just like this. “Anyone else having a hard time working out on Wegovy?” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1f2o8pu/muscle_recovery/"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; one Reddit poster last year. They even felt their arms were weaker while bowling. Another person &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1lgawf4/comment/myvkodv/"&gt;realized&lt;/a&gt; something was wrong when they could no longer do yard work around the house. Other people have &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1msh9a5/anyone_experiencing_muscle_weakness_since_starting/"&gt;noticed&lt;/a&gt; leg weakness after light walking or climbing the stairs: “I actually struggle to go up a staircase and I’m only 32,” said one GLP-1 patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I know a lot of people are working out, and I do need to begin exercising on top of the wegovy, but I’m just wondering if anyone else is experiencing extreme weakness or if it’s just me and my un-toned self,” they asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Sam’s post in particular had a lot of comments, with one respondent even urging the patient to reconsider: You are “a strong, capable goddess. You don’t need to lose weight.” Accept who you are. In response, Sam laid out the dilemma that so many people who have sought to lose weight over the years face: “Unfortunately, some of us just do NOT lose weight with diet and exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s true: Weight loss is not assured from diet and exercise. Some people &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK573068/"&gt;have a genetic disposition&lt;/a&gt; to becoming obese. And not everybody who is obese is unhealthy; the body mass index is an imperfect measurement, and some people who are technically obese can still be healthy if much of their weight is muscle. Still, the realization that obesity is a disease to be treated, rather than a personal failure that can only be remedied through personal growth, has been important in reducing the prejudices that overweight people have long faced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But at the same time, it is a slippery slope from acknowledging diet and exercise may not be sufficient on their own to thinking a drug like Ozempic can make them unnecessary. Some people, like Sam, have always exercised and viewed GLP-1s as an extra push to help them reach their weight goals. But I also encountered other people who did not necessarily have healthy habits before but were able with the drugs to cut weight for the first time. One patient on Reddit &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1ee76tc/about_muscle_loss/"&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that they don’t work out and they don’t adhere to a particular diet. They have been losing weight, but they are “scared” about losing too much weight — so they ask if they can just eat more chicken or drink a protein shake and regain the muscle “without working out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;They have reason for concern: The same clinical trials that have shown how effective GLP-1 drugs are with weight loss have also consistently reported muscle loss or weakness among patients. When one group of researchers evaluated the type of body mass that patients on semaglutide drugs were losing, they &lt;a href="https://ir.verupharma.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/225/veru-announces-positive-topline-data-from-phase-2b-quality"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that about 40 percent was important muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The GLP-1 market is only going to grow as the drugs prove useful for a wide array of treatments. People, including those who are not overweight, may take them preventively to stave off cardiovascular disease or dementia. For them, people who are already at a healthy weight, muscle loss is an even more serious concern. If GLP-1 drugs do prove to be promising for treating age-related cognitive decline, for example, then appropriate diet and exercise will be even more paramount for that patient population. The last thing we want is more seniors suffering catastrophic injuries during a fall because of lost muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But understanding what exactly is causing the muscle loss is important. Scientists are still figuring that out, but early indications are that the cause is not the drugs themselves, then some of the lifestyle changes the drugs can lead to..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One study from researchers at the University of Utah suggests the loss of strength is largely the result of not eating enough calories. In their research on mice, they &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/newsroom/news/2025/08/new-study-raises-questions-about-how-ozempic-affects-muscle-size-and-strength"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; less muscle mass loss than expected. Instead, after taking a GLP-1, mice were losing their functional strength — how much they could lift or move around — even when muscle size stayed the same. In other words, the mice appeared weaker even though their muscle mass hadn’t changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Strength is not just a factor of how much muscle you have, but whether you can move that muscle effectively. There’s an energetic component to it,” lead author Katsu Funai told me. The animals on a GLP-1 drug may have had less energy because they were eating less — and therefore they wouldn’t be able to exert as much force with their muscles. It’s not the GLP-1s per se; it’s what the GLP-1s lead to without intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The findings could inform how we prescribe Ozempic, Funai said: Smaller doses might help to mitigate the loss of functional strength. Otherwise, losing weight too quickly is going to mean losing &lt;em&gt;energy&lt;/em&gt; quickly — and therefore feeling weaker. In the excitement over Ozempic, and the potential to lose a lot of weight and fast, people seem to have forgotten a fundamental truth about weight loss: “More is not necessarily better,” Funai said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Before GLP-1 drugs existed at all, dieticians urged their patients to pace weight loss — no more than 1-2 pounds per week — for exactly this reason: You don’t want to end up malnourished and weakened. With a conventional diet, that can often lead to you eating more, which in turn eliminates the weight loss. But when your appetite is suppressed by GLP-1s, the weight loss can continue, and with it, strength and energy loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“With these GLP-1s, that conversation [about diet and exercise] has been sidelined,” Funai said. “There are nuances to these things that I think are being missed not just from the public, but also from scientists,”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="how-to-make-the-most-of-glp-1s" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;How to make the most of GLP-1s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Ironically, the very problem that GLP-1s were meant to overcome — that many Americans simply struggle to eat right and exercise enough — remains just as central even with the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And many of the people taking GLP-1s are starting at a disadvantage: Only 49 percent of Americans &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2025/05/07/americans-on-healthy-food-and-eating/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; they are extremely or very confident that they know what a healthy diet looks like, and about twice as many &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2017/02/02/americans-health-care-behaviors-and-use-of-conventional-and-alternative-medicine-2/#:~:text=Two%2Dthirds%20(66%25)%20of,say%20it%20is%20somewhat%20important"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; they should get more exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If your sole goal is to lose weight, a GLP-1 alone could get you there — but not in the healthiest way. Unless you change what you eat, you’re still putting the same junk in your body — albeit less of it — with the same or more negative effects on your energy and stamina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“If you don’t change your behavior, if you don’t change your habits, you may be looking good, you may be losing weight, but metabolically, your body is in turmoil,” said Nayan Patel, a pharmacist who works with patients taking the drugs. “We’ve got to use these drugs in the right manner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So what should people on GLP-1s aim to eat? A high-protein diet delivering a lot of amino acids is important, Patel said: Eggs, nuts, lentils, poultry, and fish are all good sources. You can cut down on the carbs and sugars; your body won’t need them to produce energy because you’ll be cutting fat. Eating protein and strength training allows your body to be more effective at trimming the fat, without compromising your core strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Like anything hard but worth doing, there’s a lot to overcome. Many Americans have become intimidated by gym culture, so they might prefer to work out in privacy, at home — but they don’t know how. One person I encountered posted online to crowdsource advice on home equipment and routines. They said they didn’t want to go to a gym, but “I know I’m out of shape,” the poster confessed to&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1id8100/muscle_loss_weakness/"&gt; their fellow Redditors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The thread flooded with advice from simple workout routines to try to role models they could follow on social media. The advice included some very approachable strategies — something as simple as sitting in a chair with your legs outstretched and using your abdominal muscles to lift them from side to side over a water bottle. Some commenters recommended incorporating a resistance band and a workout ball. Health care providers have developed general recommendations for patients taking a GLP-1 drug: Mass General, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/news/article/fitness-for-people-taking-glp-1-agonists"&gt;advises&lt;/a&gt; a mixture of 150 minutes a week of moderate exercise — activities like walking or riding a bike — &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; about 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise like jogging or swimming laps in addition to two days of weight training and a steady dose of stretching and flexibility workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While I found plenty of people concerned with unexpected muscle loss, there were also &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1e5gycg/when_people_say_people_on_ozempic_and_wegovy_have/"&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; of patients proudly showing off their lean and muscular new physiques. It can be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;But in this vision, GLP-1s are a jumpstart, not a shortcut. “Losing weight is everybody’s goal. Using a drug to jumpstart is an excellent way to do the process,” Patel said. “But if you’re not taking the first two steps, you’ll stumble until you fall flat on your face.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQSkFiRXpDOE1uZDllY2JEWlNObXh6MDR5d3FOaDdxOHF5NUQwYzRLSDJwQXU4SnpTa0hzX2dsdmVDaEtRaHBwVkVodzRwNUFHUnRvQndYd0E4LXNaNUdKVDRiUmFHMllVYWdMcmNSTnBpRWVXZmNET24yUjRKUmlWVXhmS0RBZWFLelJkbm9hWFNLekZxSVVNNzYyRC15djAtZkI5UEEzLUQ</guid></item><item><title>当扫描显示新的风险细节时，对化妆品面部填充物的警告- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c773n331055o</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;Warning over cosmetic face fillers as scans reveal new details of risks&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-573fa0e8-0 bWRWzH"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-573fa0e8-11 cOQNNv"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0" class="sc-573fa0e8-5 gXJgDY"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="sc-573fa0e8-7 gqeTMs"&gt;Michelle Roberts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0-role-location" class="sc-573fa0e8-8 bIfajQ"&gt;Digital health editor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 eRlINq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251127-095948-54e3bea482-web-2.35.0-9/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/91c5/live/5824e410-cf63-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/91c5/live/5824e410-cf63-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/91c5/live/5824e410-cf63-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/91c5/live/5824e410-cf63-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/91c5/live/5824e410-cf63-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/91c5/live/5824e410-cf63-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/91c5/live/5824e410-cf63-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/91c5/live/5824e410-cf63-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A close-up of a woman's face, side on, getting an injection of filler into the skin surrounding her lips.

These meetings are normally technical, evidence-based, and grounded in predictable procedures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in recent months, in a shift fueled by health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/11/rfk-jr-names-new-acip-members-replaces-cdc-vaccine-experts-he-just-fired/"&gt;growing influence over the committee&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/20/cdc-vaccine-safety-website-promotes-debunked-autism-link/"&gt;CDC’s public-facing materials&lt;/a&gt;, ACIP has drifted toward something more concerning: inflating speculative risks while downplaying well-established vaccine benefits. This imbalance has already surfaced in procedural irregularities, unsupported proposals, and confusing CDC communications, with the potential to disrupt vaccine access and public confidence at a time of rising infectious disease threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has positioned himself as a champion of scientific rigor and radical transparency. Yet his early actions at the CDC tell a different story. He &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/21/rfk-jr-ordered-vaccines-autism-cdc-website-change/"&gt;personally ordered&lt;/a&gt; revisions to CDC vaccine-safety webpages and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/27/covid-shots-pregnant-women-children-recommendation-change-hhs-secretary-kennedy/"&gt;announced changes to Covid-19 vaccine guidance&lt;/a&gt; — without new evidence and without CDC subject-matter review. These unilateral moves bypass the scientific guardrails and rigor he claims to value.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result: CDC publications now introduce ambiguity where none exists. ACIP, though technically independent, can’t ignore an official website that implies uncertainty about &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/03/vaccine-autism-rfk-jr-how-science-proves-vaccines-do-not-cause-autism/"&gt;long-settled science on vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. Kennedy has effectively created a policy-shaping source document that carries the CDC seal without CDC oversight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/26/cdc-acip-rfk-vaccines-public-health-policy-changes/"&gt;June meeting&lt;/a&gt; offered the first signs of a committee losing its footing. New members revisited and re-voted on issues the following day, evidence frameworks were sidelined, and voting language was drafted on the fly rather than through the normal public comment process. The September meeting went off the rails with impromptu presentations of data that lacked substantial evidence or peer review. When a scientific body stops following its own procedures, rigor and transparency both slip, and public trust erodes.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The only formal vote at the Dec. 4-5 meeting involves the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/02/cdc-acip-meeting-hepatitis-b-shots-vaccine-integrity-project/"&gt;hepatitis B vaccine birth dose&lt;/a&gt;. However, loosely defined sessions on “CDC Vaccine Risk Monitoring Evaluation,” “Vaccine Schedule History,” and the “Childhood/Adolescent Immunization Schedule” could invite misapplied risk framing, especially given the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/20/cdc-vaccine-safety-website-promotes-debunked-autism-link/"&gt;CDC website’s new, ambiguous language&lt;/a&gt; that mirrors terminology previously seen on a &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/anti-science/fake-cdc-vaccine-site-linked-anti-vax-nonprofit-once-headed-rfk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;“fake CDC website” linked to anti-vaccine groups&lt;/a&gt;. Even if the committee takes no drastic action, raising fringe concerns in an official forum can legitimize their ideological questions, an increasingly common tactic among newer members.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Misguided discussions don’t remain theoretical. They shape public perception, influence future votes, and trigger ripple effects in vaccine supply and coverage. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Altering the hepatitis B birth dose could destabilize the entire childhood schedule. Combination vaccines that include hepatitis B depend on stable timing. If timing shifts, combination products may become unusable, forcing a return to single-dose formulations that the U.S. currently lacks the capacity to produce. Manufacturing new standalone vaccines could take months to years, leaving gaps in protection and risking increases in hepatitis B and other vaccine preventable infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aluminum, a critical adjuvant component of many routine childhood vaccines with decades of safety data, remains a favorite target among those alleging undefined dangers. Removing adjuvants would require new formulations, clinical trials, and regulatory review, jeopardizing availability of vaccines for hepatitis A and B, HPV, pneumococcal disease, meningococcal disease, and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such instability could send manufacturers a clear signal that the U.S. is no longer a predictable environment for vaccine production leading to fewer manufacturers and fewer available vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s revised vaccine-autism language, while not explicitly claiming causation, strongly implies that science cannot rule it out. This rhetorical device contradicts extensive evidence and opens the door for petitions to add autism to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) injury table, potentially unleashing tens of thousands of claims unsupported by science. VICP, the system that provides financial compensation to people who have been seriously injured by certain vaccines, could be depleted, and manufacturers might reconsider continuing in the U.S. market. This is more than poor communication; it sets the stage for litigation that undermines both science and vaccine access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reversing this trend in vaccine policy requires immediate and coordinated action.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, the scientific community must reaffirm the proven benefits of routine vaccination, especially the hepatitis B birth dose, which prevents infections from mothers, caregivers, and household contacts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, professional societies and public health organizations should prepare clear statements countering misconceptions likely to surface during or after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, CDC leadership must restore scientific credibility by ensuring website content reflects peer-reviewed evidence, not political pressure or manufactured ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health institutions now face a choice: reinforce trust through evidence-based practice or erode it by elevating speculation over science. The path forward is clear: follow evidence, uphold process, communicate clearly, and keep the mission focused on protecting the health of the American people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the upcoming ACIP meeting, the committee must resist raising hypothetical risks not grounded in rigorous science, while burying real, lifesaving benefits. The country deserves better — and our public health system depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;

And that’s exactly the vibe in the kitchen in this video from @loofythegolden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It starts with a close look at Loofy’s bowl, all prepped and ready to go, and then the camera swings to him — standing there like he’s been waiting for this moment all afternoon. The &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt;‘s paws do this tiny hop-in-place dance routine the second he realizes the bowl is on the move. Even following his mom’s steps for step, as if he’s helping escort the meal to its destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retriever gets ready to eat with a little dancy dance in adorable video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The best part is how well everything is synchronized. Loofy’s mom lifts the bowl off the counter and asks, “Are you ready to eat?” and he immediately answers with that wiggly little dance. It’s not wild or frantic — just a bouncy, hopeful shuffle Golden Retrievers seem to have perfected. She walks toward his feeding stand, and he mirrors every stride. Tail swishing like it’s trying to keep time with the beat in his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Halfway there, she pauses and tells him to sit. He drops into position right away, still behaving himself, eyes locked on the bowl. She jokes that “the whole internet thinks I’m starving you by not giving you cookies,” and honestly, Loofy doesn’t help his case — he looks like a dog who could win an Oscar for “Most Convincingly Hungry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Once the bowl finally hits the stand, she gives him a quick scritch. And he dives in with the enthusiasm of someone who’s been waiting hours, not minutes. It’s no wonder the video has racked up 8.9k likes. The whole thing is just sweet, simple joy, wrapped in one dinner dance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The comments agree: “GOOODBOOOOOOOY,” “He is adorable!!,” and our favorite — “I thank you my hooman for my food with a little dance.” It fits him perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/198123-golden-retriever-dance-food-mom-video-cute" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: Golden Retriever Does Little Dancy Dance as Mom Serves Food;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Video: Golden Retriever Does Little Dancy Dance as Mom Serves Food&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 10:05:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxNaThUcXdNS05TcXNwdXk5RzNtTE1udVJaVW9nZE1XQkl4ZjljVDdteGpUSHo3NG41NjFJaUQxcUFnY2tqdjJYWnIwZ1FERFVycGp0aFlocTJlOUx0YXE0UHlpVDBLWHpwTEpkSk1oMldOcHp1WlR5UUs2RGNuSmF0cUc2ZlBIVFlFQmVUcjJTRGlHaVda</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心顾问可能会推翻新生儿乙型肝炎疫苗的建议- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-advisers-reverse-newborn-hepatitis-b-vaccine-recommendations-rcna246812</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d47bc7" class="body-graf"&gt;A group of advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is preparing to vote on whether the agency should scrap its long-standing recommendation that every baby get a hepatitis B vaccination within 24 hours of birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-40256c" class="body-graf"&gt;The shot — universally recommended for newborns in the U.S since the early 1990s — is credited with &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00333549231175548" target="_blank"&gt;driving down cases of acute hepatitis B infections in kids by 99%&lt;/a&gt;. The virus, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. There is no cure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-282263" class="body-graf"&gt;Despite its success, the hepatitis B vaccine has become the latest target of skeptics who question whether the benefits of the shot outweigh potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-664094" class="body-graf"&gt;A vaccine given on “day one has a risk of neonatal fever, which causes more interventions” like blood work to determine the cause of the fever, said Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who practices at Driscoll Children’s Hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c49b14" class="body-graf"&gt;Milhoan has been a member of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) since June, when Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-guts-acip-cdc-vaccine-panel-rcna211935" target="_blank"&gt;fired all of its members&lt;/a&gt;, replacing them with his own appointees. On Monday, Milhoan was named the new ACIP chair, replacing Martin Kuldorff, a biostatistician who &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-appointed-cdc-vaccine-panel-says-will-scrutinize-childhood-vac-rcna214941" target="_blank"&gt;previously cast doubt on childhood vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, including the one for hepatitis B. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4096bf" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Sean O’Leary, a pediatric infectious disease expert and spokesman for the American Academy of Pediatrics, said he has never seen a serious reaction after “thousands of babies” have been given the hepatitis B vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e52e33" class="body-graf"&gt;“I never once saw a fever actually associated with hepatitis B vaccine,” O’Leary said at a media briefing Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-17bddc" class="body-graf"&gt;And a review of more than 400 studies found no evidence that the birth dose of the vaccines causes any short- or long-term health problems. On the contrary, the review of research, published Tuesday by the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/groups-organize-form-unbiased-independent-vaccine-panel-rcna212468" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt;, an independent group of experts led by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, found that giving newborns the hepatitis B vaccine has prevented more than 6 million infections and nearly 1 million hospitalizations. The paper was not published in a peer-reviewed journal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-478148" class="body-graf"&gt;ACIP is scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday. The committee makes recommendations to the CDC director, who can then choose whether to adopt them. While a vote against newborn vaccination does not prohibit doctors from administering the shot, the panel’s recommendations influence insurance coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e41d92" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear whether the ACIP members would vote to eliminate or delay that first dose of a hepatitis B vaccine by a month or two. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-12-01-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;agenda posted online as of Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; described the meeting in broad strokes, offering no details about who would be presenting data. A &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-panel-hep-b-babies-data-rcna232394" target="_blank"&gt;vote on the vaccine&lt;/a&gt; was supposed to take place at an ACIP meeting in September, but it was tabled because of confusion among committee members. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e92349" class="body-graf"&gt;Hepatitis B can spread through sexual contact and sharing drug paraphernalia, such as needles. It can also pass from person to person if they share common household items such as toothbrushes or razors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-79ce28" class="body-graf"&gt;Milhoan said any decision to give newborns hepatitis B vaccines should be made based on clinicians’ individual assessments of the babies’ risk for infection — that is, whether a pregnant woman tests positive for the infection or has a “questionable infectious disease background.” At September’s ACIP meeting, the panel voted unanimously to recommend testing all pregnant women for hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3674af" class="body-graf"&gt;But not all pregnant women receive prenatal care, and if they do, not all feel comfortable speaking frankly with their doctors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-14553c" class="body-graf"&gt;Milhoan appeared to dismiss the argument that women may not divulge activities that could increase their risk for hepatitis B because of stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-74bf85" class="body-graf"&gt;“I hope they love their baby more than they love their pride,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6e56dd" class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2738558" target="_blank"&gt;2019 report&lt;/a&gt; showed that just 84% to 88% of pregnant women are tested for the virus. Without vaccination, 90% of babies exposed to the hepatitis B virus during birth develop chronic hepatitis, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-hepatitis-b-vaccine-given-to-newborns-reduces-risk-of-chronic-infection/#:~:text=Newborns%20infected%20with%20hepatitis%20B,will%20die%20from%20the%20disease." target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1f0b12" class="body-graf"&gt;The hepatitis B vaccine is not the only immunization Milhoan has cast doubt on. He is a senior fellow at the Independent Medical Alliance — formerly known as the Front Line Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance — a group that has advocated for unproven treatments for Covid. His &lt;a href="https://imahealth.org/experts/kirk-milhoan/" target="_blank"&gt;biography on the IMA’s website&lt;/a&gt; says he “is dedicated to treating patients affected by acute SARS-CoV-2 infections, Long Covid, and vaccine-related cardiovascular toxicity due to the spike protein.” Last year, he participated in an &lt;a href="https://crescentcitytimes.com/special-event-covid-hearings/" target="_blank"&gt;event with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene&lt;/a&gt;, R-Ga., about alleged injuries associated with the shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b55413" class="body-graf"&gt;Milhoan has been especially critical of Covid vaccines for their link to a small but increased risk of a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/heart-issues-common-covid-infection-vaccination-cdc-reports-rcna21558" target="_blank"&gt;heart condition called myocarditis&lt;/a&gt; in young men. The link was not seen in clinical trials; it was detected in 2021, soon after the shots were made available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ae0a52" class="body-graf"&gt;“The rates of myocarditis were much higher than anyone thought,” Milhoan said. He said he was labeled an “anti-vaxxer” for speaking out about the potential risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-191097" class="body-graf"&gt;“People were saying, ‘Are you against the vaccines?’ I’m just trying to show you what we’re seeing,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a085c" class="body-graf"&gt;Over the weekend, Dr. Vinay Prasad, the vaccine chief at the Food and Drug Administration, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-covid-vaccines-children-deaths-rcna246437" target="_blank"&gt;told staff members in a memo that an internal review&lt;/a&gt; found that at least 10 children died “after and because of” Covid vaccines and suggested the deaths were tied to myocarditis. Prasad did not provide any evidence to back up the claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d25dfc" class="body-graf"&gt;Studies have shown that myocarditis is more commonly associated with Covid infection than vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1c47b3" class="body-graf"&gt;This week’s ACIP meeting is also expected to include discussion of the use of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines. The ingredient is added to prompt the immune system to react better to vaccines. A &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997" target="_blank"&gt;study of more than 1 million people&lt;/a&gt;, published over the summer, found that &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/study-finds-no-link-aluminum-vaccines-autism-asthma-rcna218682" target="_blank"&gt;aluminum adjuvants were not linked to an increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of 50 chronic conditions, including autoimmune diseases, allergies and autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-15d89e" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The meeting follows months of upheaval within the CDC, including mass firings and significant changes to its messaging. On Nov. 19, a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/autism.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC webpage&lt;/a&gt; that once stated unequivocally that vaccines do not cause autism &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-autism-vaccines-webpage-studies-changes-language-rcna244936" target="_blank"&gt;was rewritten&lt;/a&gt; to suggest, without evidence, that health officials had “ignored” possible links between the shots and the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNVFJVVnhlMFlzUXk3dGsyTmxPQWdWSFZ4SHdJZm9acGtVX3Z6cmdoS3M4YnYxRE85TERBVXJBVnpUNE1OQUJDVlkwNjk3bWIzZGx4bkF3MGkzcjFwMThzZ2djZTRGSlpDRV96cHd3TGg1b2FHNnBLZzlrOUZVdHNTX1hQRVhQd190NzhfUkVJTUgzVWZmcXFHRmJlQWNkSWZ1blVZbmo3MDItWnNHOG9XeHpHLTJIV0ZRVWfSAVZBVV95cUxQR2FBRFhLLTZsbkhhYUtlQXlBTXJmd0ZqQ29fSE9yeG9VaTRIc2N5TXkxbmFlelVQZEw3OVpfaktWQ3pKaTZLRTlpdm8yMWd5UHYzX0JqUQ</guid></item><item><title>医生警告推迟为新生儿注射乙型肝炎疫苗可能会重现致命的威胁- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/12/03/nx-s1-5629005/acip-hepatitis-b-rfk-jr-childhood-vaccine-schedule-liver-failure-newborns</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisory panel appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is scheduled to discuss and vote on the hepatitis B birth dose recommendation during its two-day meeting starting Dec. 4, potentially limiting children's access.

   &lt;p&gt;Working out of a &lt;a href="https://anmc.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;tribal-owned hospital&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Anchorage, Alaska, liver specialist Brian McMahon has spent decades treating the long shadow of hepatitis B. Before a vaccine became available in the 1980s, he saw the virus claim young lives in western Alaskan communities with stunning speed.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;One of his patients was 17 years old when he first examined her for stomach pain. McMahon discovered she had developed liver cancer caused by hepatitis B, just weeks before she was set to graduate from high school as valedictorian. She died before the ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;McMahon thinks often of an 8-year-old boy who showed no signs of illness until he complained of pain from what turned out to be a rapidly growing tumor on his liver.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;McMahon can still hear his voice.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"He was moaning in pain, saying, 'I know I am going to die soon,'" he recalled. "We were all crying." The boy died at home a week later.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The hepatitis B virus is transmitted through blood and bodily fluids, even in microscopic amounts, and the virus can survive on surfaces for a week. Like many of his patients, McMahon said, both children contracted hepatitis B at birth or in early childhood.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That outcome is now preventable. A birth dose of the vaccine, recommended for newborns since 1991, is up to &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/hospitalpediatrics/article/11/5/446/180718/Improving-Timeliness-of-Hepatitis-B-Vaccine-Birth" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;90% effective&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in preventing infection from the mother if given in the first 24 hours of life. If babies receive all three doses, &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-hepatitis-b-vaccine-given-to-newborns-reduces-risk-of-chronic-infection/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;98% of them&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have immunity from the incurable virus, with the protection lasting at least &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/ask-experts/topic/hepb/vaccine-recommendations-hepb/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;30 years&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the communities of western Alaska, years of targeted testing and widespread vaccination efforts led to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12549388/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the number of cases plummeting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Liver cancer has disappeared in children," McMahon said. "We haven't seen a case since 1995. Nor do we have any children under 30 that have gotten infected that we know of."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He worries those hard-won gains could soon be rolled back.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Pushing Back the Dose?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisory panel appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is scheduled &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-11-14-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;to discuss and vote on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the hepatitis B birth dose recommendation during its two-day meeting starting Dec. 4, potentially limiting children's access.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;On Tucker Carlson's podcast in June, Kennedy falsely claimed that the hepatitis B birth dose is a "likely culprit" of autism.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He also said the hepatitis B virus is not "casually contagious." But &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/02-langer-hep-b-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;decades of research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows the virus can be transmitted through indirect contact, when traces of infected fluids like blood enter the body when people share personal items like razors or toothbrushes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The committee's recommendations carry weight. Most private insurers must cover the vaccines the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices endorses, and many state vaccination policies are directly linked to its guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Neither ACIP nor the CDC is regulatory. They cannot mandate immunizations. It's &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/state-health-policy-data/a-look-at-recent-changes-to-state-vaccine-requirements-for-school-children/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;up to states&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to do that. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But keeping the recommendation for a hepatitis B vaccine at birth preserves the widest range of options for families. They can choose to vaccinate at birth, wait until later in childhood, or not vaccinate at all, and insurance will continue to cover the cost of the shot as long as it remains approved by the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Two senior FDA officials — Commissioner Marty Makary and top vaccine regulator Vinay Prasad — suggested at the end of November that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/29/nx-s1-5624998/fda-vaccines-covid-children-safety" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;changes to&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the vaccine approval process may be coming. Vaccines must be approved by the FDA to be administered in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/3042d15c-676b-48ac-8148-1a2204ef420e.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;internal agency emails&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; obtained by &lt;a href="https://x.com/AliRogin/status/1994567973030535301?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PBS NewsHour&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/29/fda-vaccine-approval-child-covid-deaths/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Prasad questioned the routine practice of "giving multiple vaccines at the same time." It's not clear whether he was referring to combination vaccines that offer immunity against multiple diseases with a single shot. Three of the nine hepatitis B vaccines currently approved by the FDA are combination vaccines. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/perinatal-provider-overview/vaccine-administration.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;birth dose&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the hepatitis B vaccine is given only as a stand-alone vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Contacted for comment, Health and Human Services spokesman Emily G. Hilliard said in a statement that "ACIP will review the evidence at its meeting this week and issue recommendations based on gold standard, evidence-based science and common sense."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;'Sowing Distrust'&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If private insurers opt to still cover the shot, misinformation from the meeting still could lead families to falsely believe the vaccine could harm their babies, said &lt;a href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/accords/about/faculty-staff-directory/O-Leary-Sean-UCD11631" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sean O'Leary&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Whatever comes out of this disaster of a meeting in December is going to be mainly designed around sowing distrust and spreading fear," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump, Kennedy, and some newly appointed ACIP members have &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/hepatitis-b-vaccine-debate-cdc-birth-dose-exposure-risk-acip-vote/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;mischaracterized how the liver disease spreads&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, ignoring or downplaying the risk of transmission through indirect contact. The hepatitis B virus is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/media/HepBSexualHealth.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;far more infectious&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than HIV. Unvaccinated people, including children, can get infected from microscopic amounts of blood on a tabletop or toy, even when the infected person is asymptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;McMahon has cared for children who tested negative at birth and later became infected through indirect contact. In a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3973412/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study in the 1970s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, nearly a third of such children went on to develop chronic hepatitis B without ever showing symptoms, he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's a very infectious virus," McMahon said. "That's why giving everybody the birth dose is the best way to prevent it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC recommends that all pregnant people be screened for hepatitis B, but it estimates that up to 16% are not tested and fall through the cracks. O'Leary and other experts say testing mothers for the virus shortly before or after delivery is unfeasible, because most hospitals lack the staff and resources.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The three-dose vaccine has a &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-hepatitis-b-vaccine-given-to-newborns-reduces-risk-of-chronic-infection/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;long track record&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of safety. Numerous studies show it is not associated with an increased risk of &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/pidj/fulltext/2004/07000/lack_of_association_between_hepatitis_b_birth.12.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;infant death&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/pidj/fulltext/2001/11000/safety_of_neonatal_hepatitis_b_vaccine.9.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fever or sepsis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/571612" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17192842/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;autoimmune conditions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and severe reactions are rare.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have an incredible safety profile," O'Leary said. "No one expects to get in a car wreck, right? And yet we all put our seat belts on. This is similar."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The CDC estimates that 2.4 million people in the U.S. have hepatitis B and that half &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/about/index.html#:~:text=About%201%20in%202%20people%20with%20hepatitis%20B%20do%20not%20know%20they%20are%20infected." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;do not know&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; they are infected. The disease can range from an acute infection to a chronic one, often with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/clinical-signs/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;few to no symptoms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If left untreated, it can lead to serious conditions such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. There is no cure. Treatment can sometimes involve &lt;a href="https://www.hepatitisb.uw.edu/go/hbv/medications-used-to-treat-hbv/core-concept/all" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;antiviral or immunomodulatory medications&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, if the benefits outweigh the risk of severe side effects.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Expert's Advice to Parents: Talk to a Doctor&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some parents may struggle to understand why a healthy newborn needs a vaccine so soon after birth, especially for a virus they feel certain they don't have and often wrongly associate only with risky behaviors, said &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;William Schaffner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of preventative medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and a former voting member of ACIP. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those perceptions, Schaffner said, mix with declining trust in public health and rising skepticism about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His advice to expectant parents who are on the fence is to talk to their doctor about the shots. Even if the pregnant woman has tested negative, he said, it's still important to give the baby the birth dose, because false negatives are possible and because the virus can spread so easily from surface contact. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Babies who receive the full vaccine series starting from birth have their chance of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4280122/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;liver cancer reduced by 84%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you wait a month and if the mom happens to be positive, or the baby picks it up from a caregiver, by that time the infection is established in that baby's liver," Schaffner said. "It's too late to prevent that infection."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He said that if fewer people get vaccinated, hepatitis B will circulate at higher rates in American communities and the risk of contracting the virus will rise for everyone who doesn't get the shots.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;More hepatitis B cases could mean higher costs for patients and the broader health care system. The CDC estimates treating someone with a less severe form of the disease costs $25,000 to $94,000 per year. For patients who require a liver transplant, annual medical expenses can climb above $320,000, depending on their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over the past 30 years, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/02-su-hep-b-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;main adverse events&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; parents have reported from their babies receiving the birth dose have been fussiness and crying, both of which pass quickly. Schaffner said that's a very strong safety profile — for a newborn vaccine with a track record of protecting babies from an incurable disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The data are so clear about this," Schaffner said. "A whole array now of other countries have initiated this program. They've modeled it on us."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story comes from NPR's health reporting partnership with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; , a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

She was inspired by innovative molecular tools that would allow her to investigate the contributions of another, more mysterious group of cells called astrocytes. What she discovered about their role in learning and memory excited her even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03633-0" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51778150.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;The computers that run on human brain cells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning, she felt like an outsider, especially at conferences. She imagined colleagues thinking, “Oh, that’s the weird one who works on astrocytes,” says Goshen, whose laboratory is at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. A lot of people were sceptical, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not any more. A rush of studies from labs in many subfields are revealing just how important these cells are in shaping our behaviour, mood and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03366-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03366-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;. Long thought of as support cells, astrocytes are emerging as key players in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Neurons and neural circuits are the main &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03425-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03425-y" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;computing units of the brain&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s now clear just how much astrocytes shape that computation,” says neurobiologist Nicola Allen at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, who has spent her career researching astrocytes and other non-neuronal cells, collectively called glial cells. “Glial meetings are now consistently oversubscribed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Out of the shadows&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far back as the nineteenth century, scientists could see with their simple microscopes that mammalian brains included two major &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03073-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03073-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;types of cell&lt;/a&gt; — neurons and glia — in roughly equal numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century technologies generated most of the excitement around neurons. Researchers studying the cells’ electrical activity showed how they create the complex networks that underlie all brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When neurons are activated, electrical signals zap down their length at lightning speed, causing their synapses to release chemical neurotransmitters. Some of these, such as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02161-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02161-5" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;glutamate&lt;/a&gt;, excite neighbouring neurons, whereas others, such as GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid), inhibit them. The development of a technique called patch clamping in the 1970s and 1980s, in which electrodes are inserted into individual cells to measure the flow of ions across membranes, let researchers probe this neurotransmission in unprecedented detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01468-3" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51349062.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Brain tissues, assemble! Inside the push to build better brain models&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, glial cells seemed to be electrically silent and were dismissed as dull by most researchers. Some glia, called oligodendrocytes, coat and insulate neurons. Others, the microglia, provide the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01502-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01502-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;brain’s immune system&lt;/a&gt;. The many functions of astrocytes proved more elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although few brain scientists focused on astrocytes until well into the 2000s, some fundamental discoveries were made before that&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Under the light microscope, astrocytes look star-shaped, stretching between neurons and tiny blood vessels in the brain. They signal blood vessels to increase or decrease their flow according to neuronal activity and extract oxygen and other life-giving molecules from the blood to ship to neurons. They clear up waste products from around the synapses and regulate ion levels there. They extract glutamate from around the neurons to stop the excitatory circuits from going into overdrive, break the neurotransmitter down and then return its building blocks to the neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes started to look more interesting when it became possible to measure calcium movements in cells. Those measurements revealed that astrocytes use fluctuations in their calcium levels to signal to each other and to other cells in response to certain molecules in their environment, such as an excess of neurotransmitters (see ‘Signals from the stars’). These calcium signals, which move slowly compared with those that pass between neurons, turn out to have big consequences. They drive many activities, including the release of further signalling molecules, ions, metabolites and other factors that affect how neurons, other glial cells and blood vessels behave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51771876.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51771876.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Signals from the stars.

But over the past decade or so, ever-more-precise research tools have revealed a different, more complex story. Many scientists who had previously focused exclusively on neurons are now using these tools to investigate how astrocytes contribute to animal physiology and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No evidence emerged to support a role for astrocytes in ultrafast neurotransmission. Instead, it is becoming ever clearer that astrocytes orchestrate the molecular mix in the environment around synapses on timescales much slower than neuronal signalling, varying that mix according to brain state — how alert or awake the brain is, for example. This, in turn, can determine whether neurons fire in response to a signal coming across the synapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advances in microscopy have shown just how closely astrocytes are associated with neurons. Beyond their star-shaped core, astrocytes have an intricate architecture with many branches that extend into tiny, delicate structures, called leaflets, that are only tens of nanometres wide. At this resolution, astrocytes, which make up one-quarter of all brain cells, look less like stars and more like bushy spheres, and they fill all the available space between neurons without overlapping with each other&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In the human brain, each astrocyte can contact up to two million synapses. What’s more, there are different types of astrocyte in different brain areas&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03641-0" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51778156.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;First-ever atlas of brain development shows how stem cells turn into neurons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vast reach of astrocytes has profound consequences in the brain, says neuroscientist Baljit Khakh at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Form follows function in biology.” His lab has developed many of the molecular and genetic tools that allow particular calcium signalling pathways in astrocytes to be switched on or off, letting scientists see what each pathway does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurons might transmit the signals that drive brain function, but it is now clear that astrocytes fine-tune those signals by altering the environment around the synapses, says neuroscientist Hongkui Zeng, director of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, Washington. “That is why it is important to learn about all brain cells, not just the neurons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Clocks, learning and memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As just one example, astrocytes resolved an open question in the field of circadian biology. How does the body’s master clock, a cluster of cells in the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) that regulates biological cycles in a roughly 24-hour rhythm, keep its circular loop? “It was a mystery,” says circadian biologist Michael Hastings at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The master-clock system is made up almost exclusively of neurons that release the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, and no one could see how a system that apparently does nothing but suppress neuronal activity could create a daily cycle. Biological clocks need a feedback mechanism so that they can generate rhythmic cycles autonomously, without needing an external signal every day to restart them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, Marco Brancaccio, a postdoctoral researcher working with Hastings, read about a glutamate detector — a fluorescent probe called ‘glue sniffer’, or iGluSnFR. Brancaccio proposed using the detector to sniff out any glutamate that might be present in the mouse brain slices the team was studying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I told Marco it would be a waste of time, because there wouldn’t be any,” recalls Hastings. “Fortunately he ignored me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brancaccio, who is now at Imperial College London, found plenty of glutamate — and to general astonishment, found that its levels were as rhythmic as those of GABA. But whereas the GABA levels were highest during the day, glutamate levels peaked at night&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We scratched our heads. Where could that glutamate be coming from?” says Hastings. It didn’t take them long to discover through a literature search that the source must be astrocytes, a cell type they hadn’t thought much about before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This set the researchers on a series of ever-more sophisticated experiments. They ultimately concluded that astrocytes support the SCN clock by switching on their uptake systems for GABA by day and turning them off at night&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51762654.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51762654.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Micrograph of clumps of astrocytes which have the appearance of the tops of bushy trees in a forest, with complex branch structures, coloured in greens, yellows, oranges and reds." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51762654.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Different astrocyte types, with their thousands of branches and leaflets, pack together to fill the brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: B. Khakh Laboratory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Particularly intriguing are studies that are revealing how astrocytes support the many subtleties of learning and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00292-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00292-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;. In one of her first key experiments with the new tools, Goshen and her team were amazed to discover how astrocytes in the brains of mice encode information about the spatial location of rewards. When a mouse had already learnt where to find a water reward, the calcium activity in its astrocytes gradually increased as it approached the reward, the scientists found. But the researchers measured no increase when the mouse moved towards the same reward in a new environment&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The finding raises interesting questions about how astrocytes are involved in the encoding of spatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, groups in Japan and the United States reported that astrocytes help with the stabilization and recall of memories primed by fear&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Because the astrocytes’ signals are much slower than the electrical signals of neurons — sometimes developing over hours or even days rather than milliseconds — they are well suited to bridging the time gap between learning and remembering, says neuroscientist Jun Nagai at the RIKEN Centre for Brain Science in Wako, Japan, who led one of the studies. “Think of them as the brain’s long-exposure camera: they capture the trace of meaningful events that might otherwise fade too fast.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because neurons and astrocytes work together to process information, researchers have started to wonder whether astrocytes drive or exacerbate diseases that have been generally considered to be neuronal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

And when you have a serial hugger in the form of a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt;, you’re basically living your best life. That’s the reality of Wally’s mom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In this video shared by @wally.meets.world, we see Wally sitting beside his mom on the couch and then slowly tucking himself into her chest like it’s the most natural thing in the world. Then he breaks into that massive, goofy smile he’s famous for, and his mom kisses him, clearly anticipating more snuggles. The on-screen text reads, “I taught my dog how to give hugs and now it’s all he does,” and you can tell instantly: this is a skill he’s taken to heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retriever learning the irresistible art of giving hugs in truly wholesome video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People loved this clip so much that it quickly racked up over 78.6k likes. After that first hug scene, the video jumps into a montage of love. For the next scene, we find them relaxing outside on a patio. Wally’s on the couch, while his mom kneels next to him, and he slowly lifts one paw, puts it on her arm, and leans his whole weight into her like he’s recharging himself with her body heat. Again, there’s this little smile he does, almost bashful, and she gives him scritches that make him sink in even deeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then we’re in the park, sitting on the grass. Here, he flops his head onto her arm, gives a couple of slow blinks, and settles in like it’s the most natural state of being. After that, the hugs start rolling in from every location imaginable — the car, the patio again, the kitchen floor. Each one looks warmer, heavier, more wholesome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And the final clip is almost too sweet. Wally’s curled up in bed, pressing his face against hers, eyes shut in bliss. It’s the kind of end-of-day hug that just says, okay, I’m safe here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The comment section is basically a puddle of feelings: “Goldens are something like out of this world,” “I need a hug,” and “Can you clone Wally for the rest of us?” Honestly, same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/198096-golden-retriever-hug-cant-stop-wholesome-video-viral" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Owner Teaches Golden Retriever How to Give Hugs &amp;amp; Now, He Can’t Stop;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Owner Teaches Golden Retriever How to Give Hugs &amp;amp; Now, He Can’t Stop&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 08:03:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPYk5qSVBDRGxIRjZ2NjFnc1BlSXE4OElyUE4zcHZSSjBGOU4xQ256d2FnNDYxOTlXQjk1a2hsbkhDTnE5amF4U2duY3g4ZXJKZHBlQXhKNFNWcDExU09fZlhRUjVTcWJlLU11U25jRy1jZjMxTFdHU3RQaTR0dkVDY1FBbFk2amVoMVY4cGxMcEdIRWh6VHc</guid></item><item><title>大便应该在你体内停留多久？肠道传输时间的科学-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/how-long-should-poop-stay-inside-you-the-science-of-gut-transit-time/articleshow/125736069.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gut transit time quantifies the duration required for ingested material to traverse the entire gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus, serving as a critical biomarker for digestive motility and microbiome dynamics. Whole Gut Transit Time (WGTT), encompassing the complete journey from ingestion to elimination, exhibits a median of approximately 28 hours in healthy adults, with a broad normal range spanning 10 to 73 hours based on wireless motility capsule assessments. Colonic Transit Time (CTT), the interval stool resides within the colon, averages 21 hours, segmented into proximal (median 0.1-46 hours), distal (0.3-80 hours), and rectosigmoid phases (up to 134 hours). These parameters, validated through radio-opaque marker studies and scintigraphy, underscore substantial inter- and intraindividual variability influenced by dietary, hormonal, and lifestyle factors. The study was published in BMJ journal Gut, under the title-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/72/1/180?__cf_chl_rt_tk=S9YyOVKvuh3hCDpzCPhsiLoRlkds4_iw5XIwwIq6SIE-1764744373-1.0.1.1-To.nu_5dnwO82neUk4oFKUTzfeWODDu9GFgXo9lSLzc" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Advancing human gut microbiota research by considering gut transit time.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The research and how it maps the full digestive system&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digestion is divided into precise stages with established norms. According to the research, Gastric emptying ranges from 0-6 hours-the stomach empties its contents. Small intestinal transit time is at a median 5 hours, ranging from 2-7.5 hours, during which effective nutrient absorption takes place. CTT takes center stage thereafter, in which water is reabsorbed and bacterial activity influences the consistency of the stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gut evaluation of 124 healthy subjects estimated the median WGTT to be 28.7 hours, showing great inter-individual variations depending on diet, age, gender, and activity. The normal value for WGTT falls in the range of 14-59 hours; a value below 14 hours indicates fast transit, while a value above 59 hours points to slow transit. Bristol Stool Scale offers a very simple assessment-types 3 and 4 indicate an ideal balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;6 Foods that help you poop better and relieve constipation in the morning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Transit time and microbiome dynamics&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speed is of the essence in determining microbial fate. Slower WGTT and colonic transit time extend substrate contact, promoting the dominance of Bacteroides, increased fecal pH, and the growth of methanogens, thereby increasing proteolysis. Faster rates promote Prevotella (a type of helpful bacteria that lives in your gut, mouth, and other body areas)-and short-chain fatty acid-producers such as butyrate, which nourish colonocytes and tame inflammation. Metagenomic models from the study predicted transit with 82% accuracy-AUC 0.82-by microbiota profiles, with Akkermansia muciniphila (a good gut bacteria that lives in the mucus layer of your intestines) thriving in longer times. Such variability explains conflicting diet-microbe trial results because transit is a confounder. Women usually have 20-30% longer CTT owing to the effects of progesterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risks when transit goes off the track&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prolonged retention ferments undigested carbohydrates into gases and toxins, promoting dysbiosis. Slow CTT is associated with obesity, neurological connections through poor clearance analogs, and IBS-like symptoms. Rapid transit reduces SCFA, compromising the barriers and leading to malabsorption or loose stool. Cohort studies have associated extremes with increased inflammatory markers and metabolic syndrome risk. Less than three movements per week or Bristol types 1-2/6-7 raise a red flag; monitor patterns for early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the factors that shape this?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet is the key to change: 25-50g/day fiber from oats, beans, fruits, and vegetables accelerates the colonic through to an optimal of 28 hours. Hydration-2-3L, 150 minutes/week walking, probiotics-keeps the flow going. Age slows CTT by 10-20%, medications like opioids extend, stress disrupts rhythm. Experiment with home charcoal pills or corn kernels safely to learn your personal baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms persisting beyond this require evaluation to rule out obstruction or a motility disorder. Vigorous mapping in the Gut journal advances personalized gut care, with variability in WGTT/CTT proving the demand for tailored strategies. Optimal transit fosters thriving microbes, steady energy, and resilience.

            The US stillbirth rate dropped 2% last year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr041.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a hopeful improvement after a turbulent few years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve00043b6n8fqne0ai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But there were still nearly 20,000 fetal deaths in 2024, CDC data shows, more than 5.4 for every 1,000 live births and pregnancies with gestations longer than 20 weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve00053b6nwq61i6qu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That rate is the lowest it’s been in decades, but the CDC does not necessarily consider it to be a record low.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip8gck300013b6qen7u96rx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Stillbirths have been generally trending down in the US: The rate fell from 7.5 for every 1,000 live births and pregnancies with gestations longer than 20 weeks in 1990 down to 5.7 in 2019. But the rate ticked up in the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic and has fluctuated in the years since, and the decline in 2024 essentially brought the stillbirth rate back to where it was in 2022.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve00063b6nygmi65g6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the new CDC report, the decline in the stillbirth rate last year was driven by significant change in three states: Colorado, which had a 14% drop; Utah, which had a 16% drop, and Mississippi, which saw a 21% drop in fetal mortality between 2023 and 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve00073b6n40oe2uyt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite the decrease, Mississippi still has a higher stillbirth rate than any other state, at 7.8, but officials in the state are taking action. Earlier this year, Mississippi declared a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/22/health/infant-mortality-public-health-emergency-mississippi"&gt;public health emergency&lt;/a&gt; over the rising infant mortality rate. The move creates opportunities to mobilize resources to address the issue, such as investments to activate a standardized system for maternal and infant care and eliminate &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/health/maternity-care-crisis-march-of-dimes"&gt;maternity care deserts&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve00083b6nlr9smvbk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And despite the nationwide improvement last year, especially in stillbirths during the third trimester, experts say much more work is needed to continue to bring the stillbirth rate down.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve00093b6nud32n68x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Stillbirths affect just as many families as do infant deaths each year,” said Ashley Stoneburner, director of applied research and analytics with March of Dimes, a nonprofit focused on infant and maternal health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve000a3b6nv0y97th3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a really large problem, and a lot of the risk factors that we see for infant mortality, especially very early infant deaths, are the same that we see for babies that are born still,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve000b3b6n9teidlpc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In September, the US National Institutes of Health launched a five-year, $37 million &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-launches-consortium-reduce-risk-stillbirth-us" target="_blank"&gt;Stillbirth Research Consortium&lt;/a&gt; to support efforts that reduce the risk of stillbirth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve000c3b6nn95vcan0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Research &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5785410/" target="_blank"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that about a quarter of stillbirths are preventable, but most — up to 60% – “remain unexplained even after exclusion of common causes, such as congenital abnormalities, genetic factors, and obstetric complications,” NIH said in a news release about the new consortium.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve000d3b6ns3vgsdif@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            ​Other factors that increase the risk for stillbirth include medical conditions among mothers — such as diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and substance use during pregnancy — as well as high levels of stress some environmental exposures including extreme heat and pollution, Stoneburner says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve000e3b6n4ar9d3r6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s a lot of socioeconomic factors that increase the risk for stillbirth as well, and those are things like lack of access to health care or belonging to a certain ethnic minority groups,” she said.

            The new CDC report shows that stillbirth rates have been consistently highest among mothers who are Black and those who are Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Rates of about 10 fetal deaths for every 1,000 live births and pregnancies with gestations longer than 20 weeks for these groups are twice as high as they are among mothers who are Asian, White or Hispanic.

            &lt;p&gt;A noninvasive method for measuring blood glucose levels, developed at MIT, could save diabetes patients from having to prick their fingers several times a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT team used Raman spectroscopy — a technique that reveals the chemical composition of tissues by shining near-infrared or visible light on them — to develop a shoebox-sized device that can measure blood glucose levels without any needles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tests in a healthy volunteer, the researchers found that the measurements from their device were similar to those obtained by commercial continuous glucose monitoring sensors that require a wire to be implanted under the skin. While the device presented in this study is too large to be used as a wearable sensor, the researchers have since developed a wearable version that they are now testing in a small clinical study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For a long time, the finger stick has been the standard method for measuring blood sugar, but nobody wants to prick their finger every day, multiple times a day. Naturally, many diabetic patients are under-testing their blood glucose levels, which can cause serious complications,” says Jeon Woong Kang, an MIT research scientist and the senior author of the study. “If we can make a noninvasive glucose monitor with high accuracy, then almost everyone with diabetes will benefit from this new technology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT postdoc Arianna Bresci is the lead author of the new study, which appears today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Analytical Chemistry&lt;/em&gt;. Other authors include Peter So, director of the MIT Laser Biomedical Research Center (LBRC) and an MIT professor of biological engineering and mechanical engineering; and Youngkyu Kim and Miyeon Jue of Apollon Inc., a biotechnology company based in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noninvasive glucose measurement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most diabetes patients measure their blood glucose levels by drawing blood and testing it with a glucometer, some use wearable monitors, which have a sensor that is inserted just under the skin. These sensors provide continuous glucose measurements from the interstitial fluid, but they can cause skin irritation and they need to be replaced every 10 to 15 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In hopes of creating wearable glucose monitors that would be more comfortable for patients, researchers in MIT’s LBRC have been pursuing noninvasive sensors based on Raman spectroscopy. This type of spectroscopy reveals the chemical composition of tissue or cells by analyzing how near-infrared light is scattered, or deflected, as it encounters different kinds of molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, researchers at the LBRC showed that they could indirectly calculate glucose levels based on a comparison between Raman signals from the interstitial fluid that bathes skin cells and a reference measurement of blood glucose levels. While &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2010/glucose-monitor-0809" target="_blank"&gt;this approach&lt;/a&gt; produced reliable measurements, it wasn’t practical for translating to a glucose monitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, the researchers reported a &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/raman-spectroscopy-needle-pricks-diabetics-0124" target="_blank"&gt;breakthrough&lt;/a&gt; that allowed them to directly measure glucose Raman signals from the skin. Normally, this glucose signal is too small to pick out from all of the other signals generated by molecules in tissue. The MIT team found a way to filter out much of the unwanted signal by shining near-infrared light onto the skin at a different angle from which they collected the resulting Raman signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers obtained those measurements using equipment that was around the size of a desktop printer, and since then, they have been working on further shrinking the footprint of the device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new study, they were able to create a smaller device by analyzing just three bands — spectral regions that correspond to specific molecular features — in the Raman spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, a Raman spectrum may contain about 1,000 bands. However, the MIT team found that they could determine blood glucose levels by measuring just three bands — one from the glucose plus two background measurements. This approach allowed the researchers to reduce the amount and cost of equipment needed, allowing them to perform the measurement with a cost-effective device about the size of a shoebox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By refraining from acquiring the whole spectrum, which has a lot of redundant information, we go down to three bands selected from about 1,000,” Bresci says. “With this new approach, we can change the components commonly used in Raman-based devices, and save space, time, and cost.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward a wearable sensor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a clinical study performed at the MIT Center for Clinical Translation Research (CCTR), the researchers used the new device to take readings from a healthy volunteer over a four-hour period. As the subject rested their arm on top of the device, a near-infrared beam shone through a small glass window onto the skin to perform the measurement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each measurement takes a little more than 30 seconds, and the researchers took a new reading every five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the study, the subject consumed two 75-gram glucose drinks, allowing the researchers to monitor significant changes in blood glucose concentration. They found that the Raman-based device showed accuracy levels similar to those of two commercially available, invasive glucose monitors worn by the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since finishing that study, the researchers have developed a smaller prototype, about the size of a cellphone, that they’re currently testing at the MIT CCTR as a wearable monitor in healthy and prediabetic volunteers. Next year, they plan to run a larger study working with a local hospital, which will include people with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are also working on making the device even smaller, about the size of a watch. Additionally, they are exploring ways to ensure that the device can obtain accurate readings from people with different skin tones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Korean Technology and Information Promotion Agency for SMEs, and Apollon Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

He rarely spoke. Historians who later examined his records have speculated that he may have been a victim of child sexual abuse or exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Doctors initially suspected Rayford had contracted an exotic illness, but he had never traveled outside the Midwest. Despite extensive testing, they could not explain his condition. Rayford died of pneumonia at 16 in 1969.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;An autopsy revealed another puzzling finding: small, cancerous tumors throughout his body. These lesions, later recognized as Kaposi’s sarcoma, would become a hallmark of AIDS. Rayford’s death was not linked to the emerging crisis until 1988, when researchers reexamined his case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The abyss of the unknown that swallowed Rayford foreshadowed the elusive disease’s slow but devastating spread. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, cities such as New York and San Francisco were reporting a troubling epidemic of young men — predominantly gay — suffering from the same rare cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control did not formally define AIDS until September 1982. By that point, the agency had received reports of 593 cases between June 1, 1981, and Sept. 15, 1982.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A slow dawning in the Midwest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In Missouri, the epidemic arrived slowly but inevitably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Reporting of AIDS cases to the Missouri Division of Health became mandatory only on June 20, 1983; before then, the disease went largely unreported in the state. During that time, Springfield recorded a single case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Statewide, nine Missourians and two out-of-state residents had confirmed AIDS diagnoses, according to the Missouri Division of Health, now the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Six cases were reported in St. Louis, with two deaths, and three in Kansas City. One of the out-of-state cases was the Springfield patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On June 28, 1983, the Springfield News-Leader published a story titled “Health officials on lookout for AIDS,” calling it a “mysterious disease” but noting it posed no immediate threat to the Springfield area. At the time, the Springfield environmental hygiene chief said AIDS had not yet “migrated this far.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, local health leaders exercised caution. That same day, the Greene County Chapter of the American Red Cross held a news conference to outline measures aimed at preventing the disease’s spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Blood donations had fallen nationwide, but Gene Waite, spokesman for the Greene County Chapter of the American Red Cross in 1983, doubted the crisis would affect the Ozarks’ blood banks. “Most of our donations come from Ozarkers and the majority of the problem is on the coasts,” he told the Springfield Daily News in July 1983.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Around this time, new aspects of the disease were being discovered — including its prolonged incubation period — but the root cause remained unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In November 1983, about 150 Missouri funeral directors and embalmers attended a state educational seminar on the mysterious disease. Most of them reported that Missouri hospitals and nursing homes routinely released bodies of AIDS victims without informing morticians of the cause of death or completing a death certificate, despite state law requiring it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear, rumor, and the search for certainty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The threat became undeniable to the public more than a year later, on Dec. 16, 1984, when the News-Leader ran a front-page article under the headline: “Three AIDS cases found in Ozarks.” Reporter Chris Whitley wrote that three AIDS cases had been diagnosed in Greene County since it was made a reportable disease. Health experts braced for more cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;By then, 33 AIDS cases had been reported in Missouri, 16 of them fatal. “There is very little hope for anyone who has AIDS right now,” a Springfield oncologist treating one of the three locally diagnosed patients told the News-Leader in December 1984. “It is 100 percent fatal. If you have it, you will die eventually, usually within two years.” He said he expected more local diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The same article noted “widespread rumors” that the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield was being used to treat AIDS patients from across the Federal Bureau of Prisons system. A medical center spokesman denied the claim to the News-Leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At the time, the facility was said not to have been required to report its cases to the state. A spokesman told the paper the facility had two confirmed AIDS patients, both of whom were released from custody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In response to the Dec. 16, 1984, story, a victim of AIDS wrote to the Springfield paper, pleading for an end to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The nameless writer said they had been diagnosed with AIDS in July 1984 at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis. “I inquired to local and state health agencies to see if answers were being sought in a cure, and every response (told me), ‘That money has not been put in our budget for research into AIDS.’ No federal or state monies at all,” the victim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;They said most AIDS research funds at the time came from private donations and private research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“As my disease advances, my hope is disappearing,” the victim wrote, noting they traveled weekly from Springfield to St. Louis for treatment and counseling. “Hopefully in the very near future the Reagan administration will move to help and show it cares for the American homosexuals and the rest of the American population and to find a cure and the prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A turning point — testing and public fear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A breakthrough came locally in March 1985, when a new test to detect blood antibodies associated with AIDS became available in Springfield through the Red Cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In June 1985, the Springfield–Greene County Health Department announced it would begin offering the same tests, becoming one of 11 Missouri sites. The tests were free and confidential. During that month, 10,533 cases of AIDS were diagnosed nationwide, with as many as 60 cases in Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Of the 10,533, almost half had died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That same month, Joan Hart, a freelancer from Lebanon, Missouri, called the AIDS virus a “modern leprosy” — a condemnation from God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Local alarm rose in September 1985 when two Springfield students were exposed to the HIV virus through transfusion of contaminated blood products. The discovery prompted Springfield Public Schools officials to follow federal recommendations and hold a televised news conference as the district looked at its policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The two Springfield students were the only schoolchildren in Missouri diagnosed with AIDS at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That month, Springfield sewage workers expressed concern and asked city officials for more information about AIDS, though a health department spokesman said sewage treatment employees were not in danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite the district’s efforts, PTA presidents and parents voiced concerns during a September 1985 Springfield health panel featuring school and health officials. Another meeting with a doctor at MSU followed in October 1985, as officials continued trying to quell fears and dispel myths about the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reporter’s note: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the first part of a three-part history series of digital articles reporting the history of the AIDS crisis in the Ozarks.

			&lt;p&gt;The rise of GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic and Mounjaro has been nothing short of meteoric. Originally developed to treat  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="183985" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, these drugs are now widely used for weight loss and have become household names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But alongside headlines of dramatic transformations are reports of an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and unwanted pregnancies after contraception failures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what are the risks? And what should you do if you are taking these medicines?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-babies-heres-why-oral-contraceptives-might-be-failing"&gt;'Ozempic Babies': Here's Why Oral Contraceptives Might Be Failing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do these drugs work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) drugs are medicines used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. They work by reducing blood sugar levels and reducing appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five medicines in this category are approved for use in Australia:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mounjaro (tirzepatide)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ozempic (semaglutide)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wegovy (semaglutide)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saxenda (liraglutide)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trulicity (dulaglutide).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These drugs have been around for the &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/resources/artg/217965"&gt;past decade&lt;/a&gt; but rose in popularity in recent years, with the help of Hollywood celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common side effects of GLP-1 medicines are related to &lt;a href="https://www.ozempic.com/how-to-take/side-effects.html"&gt;digestion&lt;/a&gt;: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, indigestion, stomach pain and constipation. These tend to be mild and either go away with time or become more tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more concerning side effects have prompted Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/safety/safety-monitoring-and-information/safety-alerts/product-warnings-updated-glp-1-ra-class"&gt;issue new warnings this week&lt;/a&gt; about suicidal thoughts and the lower effectiveness of oral contraceptives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 12 months to November 2025, there were 20 cases of suicidal thoughts reported in the &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/safety/adverse-events/database-adverse-event-notifications-daen"&gt;Australian Database of Adverse Events Notifications&lt;/a&gt;, which coincided with the use of a GLP-1 medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is consistent with published scientific data. A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-75965-2"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; found a link between GLP-1 medicines and a 106% increase in the risk of suicidal behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.23385"&gt;World Health Organization data&lt;/a&gt; also found a link between semaglutide use and suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183989" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183989" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/crying_woman_642.jpg" alt="crying woman" class="wp-image-183989 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/crying_woman_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/crying_woman_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183989" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Links between suicidal thoughts and GLP-1 drugs have been found in a number of studies, though others have found the opposite effect. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEAMO031Cg/"&gt;Karola G/Pexels/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all the evidence supports a link between GLP-1 drugs and suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38182782/"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; analysed the data of more than 1.8 million patients who were taking the medicines for either weight loss or diabetes. It found a lower, not higher, risk of new or recurring suicidal thoughts when compared with patients who were not taking a GLP-1 medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can these drugs affect contraception?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oral contraceptives work by using hormones to prevent the release of eggs from the ovaries and to thicken the cervical mucus. This latter effect makes it difficult for sperm to reach and fertilise an egg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These effects are only triggered when pregnancy-related hormones are at a high enough level. If GLP-1 medicines affect how the body absorbs hormones in oral contraceptives, hormone levels may not reach concentrations high enough to prevent pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers first raised the potential for GLP-1 medicines to affect oral contraceptives in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2023.10.037"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability of GLP-1 medicines to affect oral contraceptives may vary between drugs. A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2023.10.037"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; that examined the link between tirzepatide and oral contraception found that this specific drug had a higher impact on hormone absorption when compared with other GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183991" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183991" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/contraceptive_pills_green_packet_642.jpg" alt="pills" class="wp-image-183991 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/contraceptive_pills_green_packet_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/contraceptive_pills_green_packet_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183991" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some GLP-1 drugs may impact the absorption of hormones in oral contraceptive drugs. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEVhT8CjDo/"&gt;Olga Niekrasova/The Olga Niekrasova Collection/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study of semaglutide published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jcph.443"&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt; found the drug did not affect the amount of hormone that was absorbed into the body when patients were given the commonly used oral contraceptive pills ethinylestradiol or levonorgestrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a more recent study in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S506957"&gt;2025&lt;/a&gt; concluded that both tirzepatide and oral semaglutide were able to affect oral contraceptive hormone levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs should not affect the efficacy of IUDs or other long-acting (implanted) contraceptives, as they are not reliant on hormones being absorbed from the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I'm taking one of these drugs, what should I do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TGA recommends that if you're taking GLP-1 medicines, you should tell your doctor if you experience new or worsening  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="183985" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, suicidal thoughts, or any unusual changes in mood or behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women taking the GLP-1 drug tirzepatide and oral contraceptives, the TGA advises either switching to a non-oral contraceptive (like an implant) or adding a barrier method of contraception for four weeks after first taking the GLP-1 medicine, or any time you increase the dose of tirzepatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A GLP-1 drug should not be used during pregnancy, as it &lt;a href="https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2025/223/7/incidence-glp-1-receptor-agonist-use-women-reproductive-age-attending-general"&gt;may affect fetal growth&lt;/a&gt;. The adverse events database has also reported cases of miscarriages in women who were at the time taking semaglutide or tirzepatide.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosf9do006t27p3flpg2qpo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            George Mycock’s fitness routine had gotten out of hand.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5q00083b6nph3k7qxd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The 22-year-old was terrified of putting on body fat but eager to develop more muscle. He tracked his food so thoroughly that he was weighing lettuce leaves. And he was exercising –– way too much, in fact.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00093b6npt6etozi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If I halved it, I’d still probably be doing the same, if not more, than what anyone else I knew who was going to the gym,” Mycock said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000a3b6n1og35dem@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As hard as he worked, he never felt satisfied. On the contrary, he often felt like he just didn’t have the discipline or character to reach his ever-changing body goals. He felt like a loser.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000b3b6nvtblvfxp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then he found himself pulling away from his friends at university and increasingly believing people would be better off without him, he said. He was experiencing suicidal thoughts when a friend dropped by unexpectedly to check on him.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000c3b6ndlhixj90@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just started crying in front of her … I just told her how awful I felt,” Mycock said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000d3b6nnmjpfi5e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That was the breakthrough moment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000e3b6n3ziiq2ym@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At the time, I didn’t really know that it was necessarily about my body or about the eating. I just knew that I felt horrendous. I just thought I was pathetic loser. And she convinced me to get help.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000f3b6nwaxh6t07@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mycock has never received a formal diagnosis for the condition –– he only knows of one person who has. But seven years later, as a researcher in the field and doctoral student at the University of Worcester in the United Kingdom, he understands his experience as muscle dysmorphia, which is sometimes called “bigorexia.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000g3b6nfx25d202@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Muscle dysmorphia occurs when an individual becomes obsessed with becoming muscular,” said Dr. Jason Nagata, associate professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine. Nagata is lead author of a review on the condition published in The Lancet Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Health Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000h3b6nqa9jul0v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The condition is often unrecognized and behaviors that go with it can even be praised, but the condition isn’t just about vanity, Mycock said. It is a mental health condition that can have serious consequences.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000i3b6nomvek5ew@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This type of dysmorphia can include extreme exercise behaviors, concern about being “scrawny” even if a person is objectively muscular, and the use of performance- or appearance-enhancing drugs, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000j3b6nzdd5olmy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Muscle dysmorphia is considered part of a family of eating and body image disorders that are often stereotyped as being restricted to thin, White, young women. But they can happen to anyone – and sometimes they go unnoticed because they can resemble behaviors society praises.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000k3b6nkdj13zup@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In moderation, exercise is healthy, and the goal is to find activities that feel enjoyable and sustainable over the long term,” Nagata said. “But with muscle dysmorphia, workouts can shift from something positive to something that causes more stress than joy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000l3b6nvcqcmm47@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many people, especially young men, find joy and community at the gym when they go to get fit, but some people can take it too far.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000m3b6no00oo1pz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead of looking forward to a workout, people with muscle dysmorphia may feel compelled to go because they worry about missing a session. Building muscle may start to get in the way of work, school or their relationships, Nagata said. People with this condition also may withdraw from social events or their usual activities because of concerns over their appearance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000n3b6n3hnic70e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When exercise starts to take over your life rather than support it, that’s a warning sign,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000o3b6nnzx7jdmw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The dominance of exercise over a person’s life is not without consequence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000p3b6nphqqwif3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Muscle dysmorphia is linked with a higher risk of depression, anxiety, substance use, and sometimes suicide risk, Nagata said. And the performance-enhancing drugs –– like anabolic steroids –– can have health consequences on the brain, such as irritability, aggression and paranoia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000q3b6nht32tgds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overexercise can lead to muscle or joint injuries, as well, he said. Steroid use can also damage the kidneys and liver and increase heart disease risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000r3b6ny6nowulp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is hard to tell when a desire to be muscular tips over into a disorder, because many people get the cultural message that appearance is important for social status and dating opportunities, said Dr. Kyle Ganson, assistant professor in the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work at the University of Toronto.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000s3b6nsitbxb6f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For a lot of young people, they think that their body needs to look a particular way in order to succeed,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000t3b6nxj4qq219@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Boys and young men in particular are at risk for muscle dysmorphia because of the specific societal pressures put on their bodies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000u3b6n823pglfx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most boys and then have generally higher drive for muscularity overall, like they want to go to the gym. They want to be more muscular based on sort of the ideal male body,” Ganson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000v3b6na33gz1s8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Weightlifting and body building increase the risk, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000w3b6nayach3sk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Competitive athletes are especially vulnerable, and the risk is even higher when training is focused on changing appearance rather than improving performance,” he said. “Those pressures around physique can make certain athletes more susceptible to developing unhealthy or obsessive relationships with their bodies.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000x3b6nm5aytseh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mycock’s problem with fitness began when he injured his spine playing rugby at 13 and had to miss a year of school to recover. When he returned, he noticed his peers weren’t treating him the same. People who would talk with him when he was in a smaller, more muscular body suddenly were not speaking with him as much, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000y3b6nqwnfe0ng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But when he started trying to lose weight, he found that he got more praise, to the point where his back surgeon joked about him coming in to teach other patients how to do it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000z3b6ncz19sznt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But little did he know that I was, at that point, basically starving myself and exercising multiple times a day,” Mycock said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00103b6n632nwdeu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not only was Mycock’s relationship with his body tied up with his identity as an athlete, but ideas of masculinity were at play, too, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00113b6nkdtpsikt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The fitness influencers he followed online spread the message that anyone could achieve the ideal masculine body if only they worked hard enough, were disciplined enough and were man enough, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00123b6ngkn7kkoi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the stricter Mycock got with his diet and exercise, the farther the goalpost moved.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00133b6nyr7xszd8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Every time I managed to meet the thing that I was aiming at, my brain said, ‘OK, this is now a thing that I can do, therefore it’s not good enough, and I need to do more,’” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00143b6ndkcllpvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It makes sense, because social media use is associated with muscle dissatisfaction and steroid use, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00153b6na3yml769@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Boys’ bodies are on display more than ever on social media, especially through influencer accounts,” he added in an email. “Boys scroll through an endless feed of hyper-muscular, ultra-lean physiques, often heavily filtered or selected from hundreds of shots, which creates a constant pressure to measure up.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00163b6np1ethllp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When Mycock couldn’t reach the always far-off destination of the ultimate, masculine body, the message he received was that he just wasn’t good enough as a person, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00173b6nzt8v02yv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is a lot that researchers don’t know about muscle dysmorphia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00183b6n9ncj9z21@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Data on the prevalence is limited, but two studies in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33722325/#:~:text=A%20study%20of%203%2C618%20Australian%20adolescents%20found,to%20report:%20*%20Severe%20preoccupation%20with%20muscularity" target="_blank"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11916914/" target="_blank"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; estimate that 2% to 3% of boys meet the criteria for muscle dysmorphia, Ganson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00193b6ntago5bjq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One problem getting more information on the disorder is that people who have muscle dysmorphia likely have the gym and muscle building embedded in so much of their lives, that they are less likely to disrupt their world by seeking help, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001a3b6n7gbzregy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is also difficult to determine the best treatment, because the condition resembles body dysmorphic disorder and eating disorder behaviors. Dietary practices and bulking and cutting, for example, can veer into disordered eating, Ganson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001b3b6nmicjqk1h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/health/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-wellness"&gt;Cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; would likely be the first line of defense, he said. But, family-based treatment like those used for adolescents with eating disorders might provide benefit as well, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001c3b6nnr6d0mzk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Either way, with the potential for physical and mental health consequences, people concerned that they may be experiencing muscle dysmorphia should seek professional help.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001d3b6n0hf0yxyu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A therapist or health care provider may be a good place to start.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001e3b6n5cya7av1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ideally, the support comes from an interdisciplinary team including mental health, medical and nutrition providers, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Recovery from this condition isn’t linear.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Today, Mycock can eat and exercise in a way that feels healthy and balanced, but body image is still something that takes some thought, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There are still times that he feels insecure, but his work with a counselor has helped him to not make his feelings about his body the foundation of his whole life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Previously, my life was built on a pillar, and the base of that pillar was the way that my body looked and the way people saw my body, and then everything else, like who I was, was built on top of that,” he said. “So, whenever something happened to that … my whole life fell apart.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001j3b6nkuuzrnpc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His counselor has helped him change his perspective so that his body is one brick on the pyramid of his life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I now also have that I like that I’m funny and I’m a good friend and I’m a good partner,” Mycock said, “On those days when my body isn’t what I want it to be, or I feel insecure about it, it doesn’t matter, because I’ve got all these other things that I like about myself.”
    &lt;/p&gt;
