          &lt;p&gt;A 51-year-old man showed up at a hospital in Germany looking as though he was wasting away, with swelling and tenderness in his ankles and knees. Then, his heart stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors were able to resuscitate him. Then, they got to work trying to figure out what was wrong. The man told them that for three months he had been suffering from diarrhea, weight loss, joint pain, and fever. His case was reported in this week's issue of &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2413719?logout=true"&gt;the New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood tests didn't detect any infection, but imaging of his heart told a different story. Doctors saw "vegetation" on both his aortic valve and mitral valve. Vegetations are clumps or masses that often build up from an infection, generally containing a bundle of proteins, platelets, and infecting germs stuck together. While they cause damage where they are, if they fully dislodge, they threaten to move to other parts of the body, such as the brain or lungs, and cause dangerous blockages. In the man's case, the vegetation on his aortic valve appeared mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man was quickly sent to emergency surgery to replace his valves. Once removed, the diseased valves were sent for testing to see what was in those dangerous masses. The result likely came as a surprise to the doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man had in his heart &lt;em&gt;Tropheryma whipplei&lt;/em&gt;, a very common environmental bacterium that dwells in soil. Only in exceedingly rare cases does it cause an infection—but when it does it's a systemic, chronic, and sometimes life-threatening one called Whipple's disease. The condition affects about one to three people in a million, most often middle-aged Caucasian men, like the patient in this case. Overall, 85 percent of Whipple's disease cases are in men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Curious condition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how can such a common germ also cause such a rare infection? Researchers think it's due to genetic predisposition and a glitch in immune responses. Many people likely get infected with &lt;em&gt;T. whipplei&lt;/em&gt; as kids, and have either an asymptomatic or limited gastrointestinal infection. They then develop protective immune responses. But in the few people who develop Whipple's disease, this process seems to go awry. Researchers hypothesize that white blood cells called macrophages—which normally engulf and destroy invading pathogens—aren't able to finish the job. They engulf &lt;em&gt;T. whipplei&lt;/em&gt;, but don't neutralize the germ. When this happens, the immune system doesn't generate protective antibodies against the bacterium, and inflammation ratchets up. This, in turn, leads to the development of a systemic infection.&lt;/p&gt;

After meals, our blood sugar spikes, particularly if we remain sedentary. Two fresh studies have now analyzed the respective benefits of walking and doing squats, in terms of their ability to lower those &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/diabetes-patients-overtreated/"&gt;glucose&lt;/a&gt; surges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One test pitted simple body‑weight squats against walking sessions of different lengths, to see which shrinks after‑meal sugar spikes. The contest delivered a surprise winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-squats-and-mini-walks-win-the-day"&gt;Squats and mini-walks win the day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ying-Gao-55" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ying Gao&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Zhejiang University&lt;/a&gt; guided 18 young men through four, single‑day &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ying-Gao-55" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; that included long sitting, a half‑hour stroll, three‑minute mini‑walks every forty‑five minutes, or ten fast squats on the same clock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The squat and frequent mini-walk conditions slashed postprandial sugar spikes by 21 percent, when compared with nonstop &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sitting-for-hours-daily-shrinks-your-brain-even-if-you-exercise/"&gt;sitting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same sugar‑flattening effect almost doubled the benefit of the lone, 30‑minute walk. This indicates that muscles care more about timing than about total steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, energy burned was matched across conditions, so extra calorie loss was not the hero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deskbound adults spend more than 9 hours per day seated, on average, a pattern that is linked to higher diabetes &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sedentary-behavior-sitting-for-hours-health-risk-early-death/"&gt;risk&lt;/a&gt;, even in habitual exercisers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shifting some of that time toward burst‑style movement gives muscles periodic wake‑up calls without asking for gym clothes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-advantage-of-squats"&gt;The advantage of squats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squatting lights up the quads and glutes far more than an easy stroll. The trial found that higher averaged &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/4825-emg-electromyography" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;electromyogram&lt;/a&gt; amplitude in those big muscles tracked directly with lower blood sugar swings, while hamstring effort mattered less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Only increased aEMG in quadriceps and gluteal muscles was associated with a reduction in postprandial glycemic response,” the authors noted. More muscle fibers squeezing at once appear to pull extra sugar out of circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those same fibers are among the largest glycogen reservoirs in the body. Emptying them repeatedly during the workday sets the stage for later insulin‑assisted refilling, a cycle that may dampen glucose peaks in subsequent meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-walking-paradox"&gt;The walking paradox&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three‑minute strolls every 45 minutes came close to the squat effect, even though each break felt relaxed. Small bursts appear to wake up leg muscles repeatedly, keeping sugar disposal lines open throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the single, longer walk under‑performed. The data suggest that the body values frequent nudges over one heroic push, which echoes office studies where hourly movement trims cholesterol and insulin peaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/to-get-fit-and-stay-healthy-walk-this-exact-distance-every-day/"&gt;Walking&lt;/a&gt; breaks also counteract stiffness, boost mood, and require no floor space. That makes them a friendly backup plan on days when squats are impractical (such as in narrow airplane aisles or crowded buses).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lactate-and-glut4-link"&gt;Lactate and GLUT4 link&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squats briefly cut off oxygen to working muscle, boosting lactate production. Laboratory work in human myotubes shows that “lactic acid has an important role in energy metabolism of human myotubes” and even raises glucose uptake three‑fold when it replaces sugar in the growth medium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher lactate feeds a cellular message that orders more &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/10/2432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GLUT4 transporters&lt;/a&gt; to the muscle surface, the very gates that shuttle glucose inward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists agree that, in response to stimulation by insulin or exercise/muscle contraction, GLUT4 “translocates from intracellular storage vesicles to the muscle cell surface” where it plays an essential role in glucose transport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lactate shuttle also lets active muscles share this metabolite with the liver for fresh glucose production – forming a push‑and‑pull cycle that stabilizes blood sugar without sharp highs or lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lasting-ripple-effects"&gt;Lasting ripple effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Enhanced skeletal muscle and whole body insulin sensitivity can persist for between 24 and 48 hours after one exercise session,” noted physiologist &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4816200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gregory Cartee&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single bout of exercise can thus keep muscles extra sensitive to insulin for up to two days, meaning that each squat break may buy prolonged metabolic calm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because squats recruit more fibers per second than walking, they may stretch that window even further, though larger trials will be needed to test this idea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the extra edge is small, the compounding effect over hundreds of workdays could be substantial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employers who are worried about productivity may find that adding a beep on the office clock every 45 minutes is cheaper than funding a corporate gym and easier than policing step counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-leveraging-squats-in-daily-life"&gt;Leveraging squats in daily life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten deep squats take roughly 20 seconds and require zero equipment. Set a 45‑minute timer, stand up, drop and rise ten times, then sit back down, and you will have matched the glucose benefit seen in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If knee pain rules out squats, a three‑minute hallway march delivers nearly the same payoff. What counts is breaking sitting time often and pushing large muscles hard enough to feel them work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pairing these movement snacks with balanced meals can amplify their punch, especially for people watching carbohydrate intake. Consistency beats intensity, so keep the breaks small, frequent, and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-caveats-and-future-research"&gt;Caveats and future research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volunteers in Gao’s study were healthy young men, leaving questions about how older adults, women, or people with diabetes will respond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormonal differences and joint limitations could modify the squat &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/studies-learn-the-exact-amount-of-time-you-should-spend-training-to-build-muscle/"&gt;advantage&lt;/a&gt;, and researchers are already planning follow‑ups that include broader demographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory meals were standardized, yet real‑world diets vary wildly in sugar content. Future work will need to track continuous glucose monitors over weeks to see whether movement snacks tame everyday spikes triggered by pizza lunches and birthday cake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, scientists still debate the precise chain of molecular events between lactate, GLUT4, and long‑term insulin signaling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decoding that pathway could unlock new drug targets that mimic the down‑to‑earth prescription of standing up and moving every 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38629807/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp;amp; Science in Sports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 18:01:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxOWkhsdUhIMjR4NEt0MVJhZVcwdGVnWTJ5b3FFVGpFZDhxOGhmakJKdE9fQlYzNloyX2RvTFJxRTdMLWhpSm0wNVFJMTIySHotbExpRGhUbmhvdGpPV0RYMVNmNXZkVU00WExhMkNqSDI0SF9YbzJQSC1GTEhZeDBsMUNaaFhqa2trV0FkZVpuWjlHdjBBcmZZ</guid></item><item><title>亚利桑那州病人在急诊室死于瘟疫- NBC新闻 | Arizona patient dies in emergency room from plague - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQSGZscVE1X1VfMTBqQU5tVi1RS183R1VRcHgzbnZ2QlFnZklMcXhUR3k5S3B5Y093d21xdlZ4dFd0MU1GaWxzUkN4WWJOem1oQjhRZ0NuV1dzWlV5bTJJMG1Ua3ZxVWtucFYzVlFJSVRTUHVYWUMwZFlzMVZOcVJ4UElDWlhVYTZH?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a0231" class="body-graf"&gt;A person in northern Arizona has died from a case of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;pneumonic plague, local health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0aced4" class="body-graf"&gt;The unidentified patient, from Coconino County, showed up to the Flagstaff Medical Center Emergency Department and died there the same day, Northern Arizona Healthcare said in a statement. It is unclear when the death occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dff957" class="body-graf"&gt;The hospital noted that "appropriate initial management" and "attempts to provide life-saving resuscitation" was performed, but "the patient did not recover."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b8dd42" class="body-graf"&gt;Rapid diagnostic testing led to a presumptive diagnosis of Yersinia pestis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-da4585" class="body-graf"&gt;Coconino County Health and Human Services said testing results confirmed Friday that the patient died from pneumonic plague, described as “a severe lung infection caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e19ce8" class="body-graf"&gt;This marked the first recorded death from pneumonic plague in the county since 2007, when an individual had an interaction with a dead animal infected with the disease, according to county officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9341da" class="body-graf"&gt;The most common forms of plague are bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic. Pneumonic plague "develops when bacteria spread to the lungs of a patient with untreated bubonic or septicemic plague, or when a person inhales infectious droplets coughed out by another person or animal with pneumonic plague," according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d99a0e" class="body-graf"&gt;Bubonic plague — known for killing millions in Europe in the Middle Ages — is now rare but some cases are reported in the rural western U.S. every year, as well as in certain regions of Africa and Asia, according to the CDC. The disease is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis and affects people and other mammals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-19f6ed" class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms usually appear within two to six days of infection and include fever and swollen painful lymph nodes, most commonly found in the armpit, groin and neck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-17bf57" class="body-graf"&gt;An average of seven human plague cases are reported each year in the U.S., but those cases aren’t always fatal, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps-statistics/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data from the CDC from 2000 to 2023.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6db66c" class="body-graf"&gt;Humans are usually infected through a bite of an infected rodent flea or by handling an animal carrying the disease, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. It can be easily cured if given antibiotics early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-864201" class="body-graf"&gt;The hospital is working with the Coconino County Health and Human Services Department and the Arizona Department of Health Services to investigate the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aefaaa" class="body-graf"&gt;"NAH would like to remind anyone who suspects they are ill with a contagious disease to contact their health care provider. If their illness is severe, they should go to the Emergency Department and immediately ask for a mask to help prevent the spread of disease while they access timely and important care," the hospital said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aac4fb" class="body-graf"&gt;Earlier in the week, the &lt;a href="https://www.coconino.az.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=3239" target="_blank"&gt;Coconino County Health and Human Services (CCHHS)&lt;/a&gt; reported a prairie dog die-off in the Townsend Winona area, northeast of Flagstaff — which officials said “can be an indicator of plague.” The department noted the recent death is not related to the prairie dog die-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ea4e4c" class="body-graf"&gt;The impacted area was on private land and the CCHHS was working with the property owner to collect fleas for testing. Burrows will also be treated to reduce flea activity and the area will be monitored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-490d60" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Our hearts go out to the family and friends of the deceased,” said Coconino County Board of Supervisors Chair Patrice Horstman. “We are keeping them in our thoughts during this difficult time. Out of respect for the family, no additional information about the death will be released.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 17:59:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQSGZscVE1X1VfMTBqQU5tVi1RS183R1VRcHgzbnZ2QlFnZklMcXhUR3k5S3B5Y093d21xdlZ4dFd0MU1GaWxzUkN4WWJOem1oQjhRZ0NuV1dzWlV5bTJJMG1Ua3ZxVWtucFYzVlFJSVRTUHVYWUMwZFlzMVZOcVJ4UElDWlhVYTZH</guid></item><item><title>那些在60多岁时看起来仍然年轻的人经常发誓这12个小习惯- YourTango | People Who Still Seem Young In Their 60s And Beyond Often Swear By These 12 Little Habits - YourTango</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNdWZ0WUJ0elZiMlIyUTVnZUljb3V3cXlVNWpWRGUwVGl2UEx6QVhTMDkzNmVfNGh1UXpwMFpLMk5VUURicUZZNWtDdU8zTnhnYUNfTUl6a3BUU21GblBvTUZ6YXhxaEk2QW1aNVZwNFRSY2ZIUVZSWTB3UVAxSHNad2M0blBhcXpfMkdRdExMZFpaMGE5QkZlc2gwYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has long been believed that life expectancy is largely, if not solely, determined by your genetics. It turns out that environmental factors, like your lifestyle and daily habits, play a greater role in how long we will live and how well we will age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I was diagnosed with depression in 2007, I have developed better coping skills as I age by finding truly tiny things to make a big difference in managing my feelings. In the meantime, or in addition to the work you do with a qualified professional, these small habits may help you feel better, or at least help you reclaim your best self and stay young well into your 60s and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;People who still seem young in their 60s and beyond often live by these little habits:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Keep up by tuning into podcasts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-07/people-who-become-super-agers-live-by-this-rule-listen-podcasts.png" alt="woman who will become a super ager listening to podcasts" title="people who become super agers live by these rules like listen to podcasts" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; ViDI Studio / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important elements of staying young is managing my thoughts and keeping up. Recently, I have started to listen to podcasts. Not only do they silence any negative thoughts about aging, but they also educate me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t listen to podcasts about how to improve my life because I feel like they focus me on my mood instead of distracting me from it. Instead, I listen to podcasts about movies, "&lt;a href="https://podcastreview.org/review/you-are-good/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;You Are Good&lt;/a&gt;” and women, “&lt;a href="https://thehistorychicks.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;History Chicks&lt;/a&gt;” and a great one called “&lt;a href="https://yourewrongabout.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;You’re Wrong About&lt;/a&gt;” which reexamines historical events and analyzes the truth behind the stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/master-skills-live-longer-average-american"&gt;Psychology Says If You Can Master These 4 Skills, You'll Live Longer Than The Average American&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Combine Vitamin D with a great book&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-07/people-who-become-super-agers-live-by-this-rule-take-book-outside.png" alt="woman who will become a super ager taking her book outside" title="people who become super agers live by these rules like take book outside" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Inside Creative House / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading is another thing I like to do to keep my mind busy. If I can, I take my book outside and read it in the park or on my hammock. By getting outside, I &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/benefits-of-daily-sun-exposure-vitamin-d"&gt;add the benefit of sunshine&lt;/a&gt;, something proven to improve moods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I can’t get outside, I read under my full-spectrum light, a very effective sun substitute that gives the same effects. So, take some time and get outside with your book. You will be glad you did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/harvard-study-finds-thing-people-live-longer-better-lives"&gt;85-Year Harvard Study Finds That 1 Simple Thing Makes People Live Longer, Better Lives — And No, It's Not Diet Or Exercise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Destress in a warm bath&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-07/people-who-become-super-agers-live-by-this-rule-take-bath.png" alt="woman who will become super ager taking a bath" title="people who become super agers live by these rules like take bath" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Depiction Images / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A regular warm bath with Epsom salts, if possible, can help ease the aches and pains we get while living our lives, these aches and pains that can bring us down. Epsom salts can also increase the magnesium levels in the body, the reduction of which can be reduced by stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is something I do as much as I possibly can. I add lavender or eucalyptus Epsom salts, and I soak. I bring my book along and have &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/best-powerful-inspirational-books-every-woman-should-read"&gt;the added benefit of reading &lt;/a&gt;and shutting down my brain by doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warm baths are regarded for their ability to promote relaxation and reduce stress, potentially affecting longevity by addressing the negative health consequences of chronic stress. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079218301552" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; that bathing can lower levels of stress hormones and promote the release of endorphins, which positively impact mood and feelings of well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/being-happy-skill-life-lessons-training-manual"&gt;Being Happy Is a Skill — And Psychology Says These 30 Life Lessons Are The Training Manual&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Volunteer their time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-07/people-who-become-super-agers-live-by-this-rule-look-ways-volunteer.png" alt="man who will become super ager volunteering" title="people who become super agers live by these rules like volunteer" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Yuri A / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volunteering is another thing I do regularly. For years I have worked in a soup kitchen on Thursdays and for the past decade I have volunteered with the National Alliance on Mental Illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/2019328226/how-volunteer-work-can-make-impact-your-friendships-mental-health-and-self-worth"&gt;Volunteering helps with two things. &lt;/a&gt;The first is that giving back to other people &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/weirdly-effective-ways-fool-brain-into-being-happy"&gt;naturally increases dopamine&lt;/a&gt;, that feel-good chemical that courses through our body when we do something good. That feel-good chemical is an excellent way to lift our mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second reason volunteering helps is that it gets me out of the house. I do tend to isolate when I am depressed, and taking a shower, getting out of the house, and interacting with people is an excellent antidepressant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find someplace you can volunteer, somewhere you have a genuine interest. Many of my clients find working at an animal shelter, interacting with dogs and cats, can help them in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/ways-be-better-human-every-day"&gt;10 Tiny Ways To Be A Better Human — Today, Tomorrow And Always&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5.

I have decided to pursue a master’s degree in history. And it has been one of the best decisions of my life. Why? Because by doing so, I am using a different part of my brain, a part of my brain that hasn’t worked for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/fun-easy-hobbies-pick-up-need-life-change"&gt;Doing something new&lt;/a&gt; is a key way to stay youthful. Not only using a different part of your brain but experiencing things that you have never experienced before can cause dopamine to flood your body and make you feel good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/quiet-signs-someone-grew-up-feeling-emotionally-neglected"&gt;5 Quiet Signs Someone Grew Up Feeling Emotionally Neglected (Even If They Hide It Well)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6.

I am guessing that you would be happy to do this one right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to research, dark chocolate&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031938411000771" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; contains flavonoids&lt;/a&gt;, caffeine, and theobromine, all things that work together to improve mental health as you age. So, keep a bowl of dark chocolates close and indulge (within moderation) when you feel the need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/plant-habits-now-enjoy-good-life-years-to-come"&gt;Psychology Says To Plant These 7 Habits Now To Enjoy The Good Life For Years To Come&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Invest in face-to-face friendships&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-07/people-who-become-super-agers-live-by-these-rules-go-meet-friend.png" alt="woman who will become a super ager meeting a friend" title="people who become super agers live by these rules like go meet a friend" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Yuri A / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As people age, they tend to isolate. The prospect of going out in the world and interacting with people can sometimes feel overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of getting out of the house and trying to interact with many people, interact with one. A friend. Someone who makes you laugh and feel seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending time with people who love you and support you and who let you know they will always be there for you is one of the most potent anti-agers. I know the prospect is daunting, but pick up your phone right now and make a date to meet a friend, doing something that makes you happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/people-maintain-discipline-say-no-without-feeling-guilty-have-these-strengths"&gt;People Who Maintain The Discipline To Say No Without Feeling Guilty Have These 5 Strengths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. Practice mindfulness through yoga or meditation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-07/people-who-become-super-agers-live-by-these-rules-do-yoga.png" alt="woman who will become super ager doing yoga" title="people who become super agers live by these rules like do yoga" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;insta_photos / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoga and meditation have been practiced for centuries as a means to &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/tiny-things-stop-doing-manage-depression"&gt;manage one’s mental health as we age.&lt;/a&gt; Both of these practices serve multiple purposes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first is that they help distract your brain, much like listening to a podcast or reading. The second is that they help improve breathing. When done consciously, breathing can be very helpful with mental health management. Thirdly, yoga and meditation can make your body strong, and strength can make you feel really good about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meditation and yoga may also help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, with links to improvements in cardiovascular health. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0531556524001967" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Research has found&lt;/a&gt; that these practices can enhance mood and well-being, and might improve cognitive function, potentially reducing the risk of age-related cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/habits-make-sixties-seventies-best-years-of-your-life"&gt;If You Want To Make Your 60s And 70s Some Of The Best Years Of Your Life, Say Hello To These 13 Habits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9.

As we get older, &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/experts/susan-derry/why-play-is-important-for-adults"&gt;fun is something that can be elusive.&lt;/a&gt; The idea of getting off the couch and participating in life can be overwhelming, but I would encourage you to do whatever you can to have fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, one of my favorite things to do is to watch movies and needlepoint. Some people like to dance or hike, or take an art class. All things that bring them joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what is fun for you? If getting out and doing things in the world is daunting right now, find something fun you can do at home, something that might very well pull you out of any funk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/things-quietly-unhappy-wives-do-throughout-day"&gt;10 Things Quietly Unhappy Wives Do Throughout The Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10.

How does it make you feel? Does it make you feel calm or happy, or does it cause you stress?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your space causes you stress, I encourage you to &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/decluttering-process-simplifies-entire-life"&gt;try to declutter&lt;/a&gt;, to go through your things, to organize, and maybe even pitch things that you no longer use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to clean your whole space, unless you want to. A client of mine was =struggling and she found that just clearing off her desk space helped lift her spirits. When she sat down to use it or walked by it during the day, it gave her a sense of calmness that made a big difference in her moods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/habits-helped-me-quit-people-pleasing-without-being-rude"&gt;4 Habits That Helped Me Quit People-Pleasing Without Being Rude&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11.

When I walk in them, I strut, which makes me feel strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there something in your wardrobe that makes you feel good? Put it on and see the difference. Do not put on that old, comfy sweatshirt that you settle into when you're feeling blah.

The one I like best was to smile, yawn, and laugh. Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smiling can lower your blood pressure and &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/powerful-techniques-instantly-eliminate-stress"&gt;reduce stress&lt;/a&gt;. The act of smiling has also been proven to improve your mood and increase happy thoughts. I know when my kids were little, smiling at them was a key to helping me get through my day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yawning helps cool down the brain and makes you feel calm.. Laughing, like smiling, can reduce your anxiety level, which will only help you manage your moods and feel happier. So, as you can see, there are little things that you can do every day to help manage your mental health and stay eternally youthful.

For many, hitting 10,000 steps in a day has become a marker of good health — a goal that prompts post-dinner walks, lunchtime laps around the block and a reason to park a little farther away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the target is widely embraced by doctors and their patients, its origins are less scientific than some may expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The whole idea behind the 10,000 steps was actually a marketing campaign for a company in Japan that developed a pedometer,” said David Raichlen, professor of biological sciences and anthropology at USC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of walking 10,000 steps a day gained popularity in Japan in the 1960s, when a company introduced a pedometer called the Manpo-kei — a name that translates to “10,000 step meter.” Released around the time of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, the product gave people a numerical goal and helped sell pedometers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was kind of brilliant,” Raichlen said. “Is it arbitrary?

Schaben / Los Angeles Times)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers say that even if the number wasn’t evidence-based at the time, it caught on for a reason — and may have landed close to a meaningful benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It turns out, bizarrely enough, they probably weren’t that far off, even though they did not have any of the epidemiological data to support it at the time,” Raichlen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the years since the 10,000 step target gained attraction, researchers have tried to pinpoint how many daily steps are actually linked to better health outcomes. Some studies show that benefits such as reduced risk of cardiovascular disease begin around 2,500 to 3,000 steps a day. Others suggest a plateau of health-related benefits begins around 7,500 steps, Raichlen said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, many public health messages continue to promote the five-digit mark, and fitness trackers, including Fitbits and other smart devices, often set 10,000 steps as the default daily goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gregg C. Fonarow, interim chief of cardiology at UCLA, said step counts are a practical, easy-to-understand way to communicate physical activity guidelines with patients. He often recommends 10,000 steps and doesn’t view the number as random.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Conveying step count is one of the ways of quantifying, easily and understandably, a trackable, actionable way to communicate what would be a good level of physical activity for them,” Fonarow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-left&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/75cde1f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/543x371+0+0/resize/320x219!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fcc%2Fcc9384944566890bbecba82669ea%2Fwalking-10000-steps-google-trends.png 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/edb133a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/543x371+0+0/resize/568x388!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fcc%2Fcc9384944566890bbecba82669ea%2Fwalking-10000-steps-google-trends.png 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/91066da/2147483647/strip/true/crop/543x371+0+0/resize/768x525!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fcc%2Fcc9384944566890bbecba82669ea%2Fwalking-10000-steps-google-trends.png 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3dbd0dc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/543x371+0+0/resize/1024x700!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fcc%2Fcc9384944566890bbecba82669ea%2Fwalking-10000-steps-google-trends.png 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bc6bbf0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/543x371+0+0/resize/1200x820!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fcc%2Fcc9384944566890bbecba82669ea%2Fwalking-10000-steps-google-trends.png 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt='Searches for "walking 10000 steps" have increased over the past five years.' srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ed1605c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/543x371+0+0/resize/320x219!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fcc%2Fcc9384944566890bbecba82669ea%2Fwalking-10000-steps-google-trends.png 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/27813b8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/543x371+0+0/resize/568x388!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fcc%2Fcc9384944566890bbecba82669ea%2Fwalking-10000-steps-google-trends.png 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/331efef/2147483647/strip/true/crop/543x371+0+0/resize/768x525!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fcc%2Fcc9384944566890bbecba82669ea%2Fwalking-10000-steps-google-trends.png 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5599e5f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/543x371+0+0/resize/1024x700!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fcc%2Fcc9384944566890bbecba82669ea%2Fwalking-10000-steps-google-trends.png 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/440a30a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/543x371+0+0/resize/1200x820!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fcc%2Fcc9384944566890bbecba82669ea%2Fwalking-10000-steps-google-trends.png 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/440a30a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/543x371+0+0/resize/1200x820!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fcc%2Fcc9384944566890bbecba82669ea%2Fwalking-10000-steps-google-trends.png" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Searches for “walking 10000 steps” have increased over the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Google Trends)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said 10,000 steps equals roughly five miles of walking and about 150 minutes of moderate-to-intense activity — in line with existing guidelines for weekly exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Fonarow acknowledges that research findings vary. He cites one study that found risk reduction plateaued around 7,500 steps for older women, while other studies have found benefit continuing through 10,000 steps or more. “Walking is a fantastic form of exercise,” Fonarow said. “It improves blood pressure, supports brain health, reduces insulin resistance and helps strengthen the blood vessels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raichlen said he typically avoids prescribing specific thresholds. While 10,000 steps may be a useful goal for some, he said, it is not a requirement for good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A little bit is better than nothing, and then a little bit more is better than that,” Raichlen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the type of walking matters. Researchers have found that cadence — how many steps a person takes per minute — can influence the impact of physical activity. A brisk walk offers greater cardiovascular benefit than a slower pace even with the same total step count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ad963c9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7274x4850+0+0/resize/320x213!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2F2b%2F6a9a754246e69e9cbefae8fd30dc%2F1328348-tr-0729-walking-in-la-009-ik-1.JPG 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/25ba623/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7274x4850+0+0/resize/568x379!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2F2b%2F6a9a754246e69e9cbefae8fd30dc%2F1328348-tr-0729-walking-in-la-009-ik-1.JPG 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/313fae1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7274x4850+0+0/resize/768x512!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2F2b%2F6a9a754246e69e9cbefae8fd30dc%2F1328348-tr-0729-walking-in-la-009-ik-1.JPG 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9da03ed/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7274x4850+0+0/resize/1024x683!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2F2b%2F6a9a754246e69e9cbefae8fd30dc%2F1328348-tr-0729-walking-in-la-009-ik-1.JPG 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1162525/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7274x4850+0+0/resize/1200x800!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2F2b%2F6a9a754246e69e9cbefae8fd30dc%2F1328348-tr-0729-walking-in-la-009-ik-1.JPG 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="One man in a white shirt and another in a blue one on their 41-miles of walking across Los Angeles." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/631726b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7274x4850+0+0/resize/320x213!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2F2b%2F6a9a754246e69e9cbefae8fd30dc%2F1328348-tr-0729-walking-in-la-009-ik-1.JPG 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5cb3ec4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7274x4850+0+0/resize/568x379!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2F2b%2F6a9a754246e69e9cbefae8fd30dc%2F1328348-tr-0729-walking-in-la-009-ik-1.JPG 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5f0bff1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7274x4850+0+0/resize/768x512!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2F2b%2F6a9a754246e69e9cbefae8fd30dc%2F1328348-tr-0729-walking-in-la-009-ik-1.JPG 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c714820/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7274x4850+0+0/resize/1024x683!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2F2b%2F6a9a754246e69e9cbefae8fd30dc%2F1328348-tr-0729-walking-in-la-009-ik-1.JPG 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9918d8d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7274x4850+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2F2b%2F6a9a754246e69e9cbefae8fd30dc%2F1328348-tr-0729-walking-in-la-009-ik-1.JPG 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9918d8d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7274x4850+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2F2b%2F6a9a754246e69e9cbefae8fd30dc%2F1328348-tr-0729-walking-in-la-009-ik-1.JPG" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;Wes Brumbaugh, left, and Tucker O’Neill get in some steps on their 41-mile walk across Los Angeles.

For those who are largely sedentary, trying to walk 10,000 steps on day one may not be practical. “We really need to personalize these recommendations,” he said, adding that some people may choose to add resistance — like a weighted backpack — for additional benefits, but it’s not necessary for improved health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/68856ae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7744x4947+0+0/resize/320x205!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F65%2F16be570347798eddab15a175b92d%2F1479733-wk-1102-walking-groups-la-culver-city-cmh-03.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/647ed14/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7744x4947+0+0/resize/568x363!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F65%2F16be570347798eddab15a175b92d%2F1479733-wk-1102-walking-groups-la-culver-city-cmh-03.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/49c048c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7744x4947+0+0/resize/768x491!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F65%2F16be570347798eddab15a175b92d%2F1479733-wk-1102-walking-groups-la-culver-city-cmh-03.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/872893b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7744x4947+0+0/resize/1024x655!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F65%2F16be570347798eddab15a175b92d%2F1479733-wk-1102-walking-groups-la-culver-city-cmh-03.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6730b9e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7744x4947+0+0/resize/1200x767!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F65%2F16be570347798eddab15a175b92d%2F1479733-wk-1102-walking-groups-la-culver-city-cmh-03.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="A group of people walking." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3b2ebd9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7744x4947+0+0/resize/320x205!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F65%2F16be570347798eddab15a175b92d%2F1479733-wk-1102-walking-groups-la-culver-city-cmh-03.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/af70699/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7744x4947+0+0/resize/568x363!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F65%2F16be570347798eddab15a175b92d%2F1479733-wk-1102-walking-groups-la-culver-city-cmh-03.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3c7886e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7744x4947+0+0/resize/768x491!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F65%2F16be570347798eddab15a175b92d%2F1479733-wk-1102-walking-groups-la-culver-city-cmh-03.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/27b5c41/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7744x4947+0+0/resize/1024x655!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F65%2F16be570347798eddab15a175b92d%2F1479733-wk-1102-walking-groups-la-culver-city-cmh-03.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04265a1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7744x4947+0+0/resize/1200x767!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F65%2F16be570347798eddab15a175b92d%2F1479733-wk-1102-walking-groups-la-culver-city-cmh-03.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04265a1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7744x4947+0+0/resize/1200x767!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F65%2F16be570347798eddab15a175b92d%2F1479733-wk-1102-walking-groups-la-culver-city-cmh-03.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;The Culver City EverWalk Walking Club, one of several walking groups in L.A., usually meets on the first Saturday of every month.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Christina House / Los Angeles Times)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Parveen Garg of Keck Medicine of USC also sees patients aiming to meet step goals. While spreading activity throughout the week is ideal, he said it’s fine if some days are more active than others. For patients with limited time or energy, walking more on the weekends or during longer breaks can still offer meaningful benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garg said he reminds patients that walking is beneficial even at lower levels. Multiple studies show that risk of cardiovascular disease and premature death decreases measurably beginning around 2,500 steps per day, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While spreading activity throughout the week is ideal, he said it’s fine if some days are more active than others. For patients with limited time or energy, walking more on the weekends or during longer breaks can still offer meaningful benefits. Like other experts, Garg emphasizes that the benefits of movement don’t begin at 10,000 steps — they can start much earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As humans, we like goals,” Garg said. “We like to feel like we’ve accomplished something. We like to check off boxes. … It does give people a goal to accomplish. In that aspect, it’s really great — as long as it does not discourage people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He encourages his patients to prioritize aerobic activity — movement that gets the heart rate up — even if it’s done in short bursts or mixed into daily routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether a person walks 2,000 steps or 10,000, local experts agree the key is consistency, and increasing activity over time can be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just keep moving,” Raichlen said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 17:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNV0pXUmw4azdkYk1SV3E4OU5sUHBtQVVnRTFWTlFtNUpaQThZQW9VRDhvYzh2Sy0yVEtfT3lhOEdtcG1RNnhWMG00ZlFrbHVWcDNCTWktamFCMWw1Wm4wUjA3MkVQQzk4dzBnRUVvelhLWk5uYkxQd01YMTF4NEZlRWJrVDloSDhPYlB0dmFoQlM</guid></item><item><title>“麻疹真的是一次飞机之旅” ：专家警告夏季旅行期间爆发-卫报 | ‘Measles really is an airplane ride away’: experts warn of outbreak amid summer travel - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPak1OcXV1RXMzTDBHS2RaUzdFdEU1WU9oTEFOck90SFFHdmU4RmtOYzAzeDd4Wkl3akZHd3VPbm9JOGJ1NHcxNlFuUl9nb1p3eFlwUlpWLV9FWFFIWDJkRVZfZ25DOHJhVFpnRjJmNk1mbkViYWgwWm40OElSXzNaeQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The US is in the midst of the worst measles outbreak in 33 years, according to figures released this week.

However, experts warn the US may be entering a “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;post-herd immunity&lt;/a&gt;” era after the Covid-19 pandemic, which &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/29/childhood-immunisation-plummeted-pandemic" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;disrupted&lt;/a&gt; routine childhood immunization visits, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/annual-measles-cases-record" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;supercharged&lt;/a&gt; the reach of anti-vaccine groups and saw the rise of a wellness influencer culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Measles really is an airplane ride away. It’s a car ride away. The reason we haven’t had it for 20 years is because of the high vaccination rates,” Katherine Wells, director of public health for the city of Lubbock, Texas, told &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/09/measles-america-breaks-33-year-record-anti-vaccine-sentiment-key-factor-behind-outbreaks/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Stat News&lt;/a&gt;. “And as soon as we start seeing that drop again, we have more vulnerable people, and that gives measles places to spread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to medicine. It causes a characteristic top-down rash, runny nose, high fever and red, puffy eyes. Although most people recover from the disease, it hospitalizes as many as one in five and causes pneumonia in one in 20 children, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. It can also cause serious complications, including brain swelling leading to permanent disability in one in 1,000 children and death in 1-3 in 1,000 children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Health officials have reported 1,297 confirmed cases of measles in 2025, according to a &lt;a href="https://cori.centerforhealthsecurity.org/resources/measles-outbreak-response" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;dashboard&lt;/a&gt; from the Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Outbreak Response Innovation on Friday. The figures are slightly higher than those reported by federal health authorities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;), which reported 1,288 cases, but last updated their tally on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Both of those figures exceed the 1,274 cases reported in all of 2019. The next highest recent year was 1992, when 2,126 cases were reported. Importantly, that was before the US reached measles elimination status in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Three people have died in the 2025 outbreak, including two unvaccinated but otherwise healthy children in &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, and one unvaccinated adult in &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, according to state health authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;North Dakota is just one example of how difficult it has been for states to prevent measles cases. The state had just hit the 42-day milestone without any new cases – a federally set limit to declare the end to an outbreak – when an unvaccinated person traveled out of state and contracted the disease, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.inforum.com/health/north-dakota-reports-first-case-of-measles-in-more-than-a-month-just-as-it-reached-outbreak-over-milestone" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;InForum&lt;/a&gt;, a local news outlet in North Dakota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, one of the world’s best-known vaccine skeptics, has also disrupted US vaccine policy and spread &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/01/rfk-mmr-vaccines-fetus-claim" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;inflammatory information&lt;/a&gt; about the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In June, Kennedy fired all &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/10/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-panel" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;17 members&lt;/a&gt; of a vaccine advisory panel that is a key link in the distribution pipeline, and stacked the committee with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/13/eight-new-cdc-vaccine-advisers-robert-f-kennedy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;seven ideological allies&lt;/a&gt;. The group declared in its &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/25/cdc-vaccine-panel-rfk-acip" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;first meeting&lt;/a&gt; that it would review the schedule of childhood vaccines and review older vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy’s changes to federal vaccine policy are now the subject of a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/pregnant-doctor-covid-19-vaccine-rfk-jr-trump" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;lawsuit by a pregnant physician&lt;/a&gt; who was denied a Covid-19 vaccine. Kennedy unilaterally declared Covid-19 vaccines would no longer be recommended for healthy pregnant women, despite many studies showing they are at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 17:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPak1OcXV1RXMzTDBHS2RaUzdFdEU1WU9oTEFOck90SFFHdmU4RmtOYzAzeDd4Wkl3akZHd3VPbm9JOGJ1NHcxNlFuUl9nb1p3eFlwUlpWLV9FWFFIWDJkRVZfZ25DOHJhVFpnRjJmNk1mbkViYWgwWm40OElSXzNaeQ</guid></item><item><title>林肯县报告了8例麻疹病例- KELOLAND.com | 8 measles cases reported in Lincoln County - KELOLAND.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPeGlhWEFTeEVjbXVOUkNpNm1KNU93OGoybG10U3dDbEl1TXJZV2V3UHpYeW5uTHlIUFFYcTBrOG1udy1UUnlLR0hFSVRfWHdjS25ZcEp0MGRyOHljUmpSTmd0US1jdFV2RDNnS2Y0Q3ZRY2ZiR1I5c2MwaWlNSG9jNWtCdHRaQVhqaWZnNkt0ZWNkQlhz0gGaAUFVX3lxTE5TYjNTY2t4NGdRUElIZnJIZWxzSUZWRERKVXcwN1QxV0pzbUh5OWE3Q1pfWTF0OGJUdVVIXzlNbF9nVXVPclVJS2YtSEg3MWJPT1U0eDhxa2lEb2FLaHcteXlKMTVUeThKWG9hYU9fd212b2drai1QcjdsYlI4RFJ3SXJjQi1GNnlFNUdtLXlDNV9tM05tY3BuWFE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

She figured it would go away like any other pimple eventually does. It started turning red in December 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She brought it up to her dermatologist at her next visit, Dr Hooman Khorasani, a dermatologic and cosmetic surgeon based in New York. When Dr Khorasani examined the spot under a microscope, he thought it looked suspicious. He could see certain blood vessels not seen in normal acne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After collecting a small bit of tissue and running some tests, Dr Khorasani called Haley with crushing news: the spot was basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most common form of skin cancer. It results from specific mutations in skin cells and, while they can be sporadic, they’re generally a result of exposure to UV radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hearing the word cancer come out of her doctor’s mouth was scary, but he assured her that, because they caught the cancer early, she had an excellent prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;BCC grows slowly and seldom metastasizes. When caught early, localized cases are typically curable, with a near 100 percent five-year survival rate—among the highest of all cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Haley had surgery scheduled for a few weeks after her diagnosis. Dr. Khorasani would perform &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11623929/Jill-Biden-71-undergo-preventative-skin-cancer-surgery-Mohs-procedure-like.html"&gt;a Mohs micrographic surgery&lt;/a&gt; on her forehead, which involves removing thin layers of tissue very precisely, continually checking the layers under a microscope until all the cancerous cells have been eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A year after noticing a persistent spot, Emily Haley assumed it was just a pimple, but when it turned red in December 2024, her dermatologist, Dr. Hooman Khorasani, examined it and found abnormal blood vessels. A biopsy confirmed basal cell carcinoma (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even Haley’s doctor was hesitant to believe the small red bump was cancer. Haley was only 31, and the age group most often diagnosed with this type of cancer is 70 to 79-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Haley had a family history on both sides. Her mother developed the same kind of cancer in her 60s, about seven years ago, and her dad developed precancerous skin growths when he was in his 50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.aol.com/thought-just-zit-actual-diagnosis-202500735.html"&gt;Women’s Health&lt;/a&gt;: ‘My family history combined with my alabaster skin made it feel almost unavoidable that I’d face a similar fate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But in an attempt to protect myself, I stuck to my sunscreen routine, never used tanning beds, and visited a dermatologist annually for skin cancer screenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Developing basal cell carcinoma despite my good habits (and getting diagnosed decades earlier in life than my parents) came as a shock. It was a stark reminder that skin cancer can happen to anyone at any time.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was initially concerned about the scar that would result from the Mohs surgery. Some degree of scarring is to be expected, but as a marketing professional in the beauty industry, minimizing the signs of her cancer was important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The state of my scar and the various bandages covering it naturally drew attention, but not necessarily the kind I wanted,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I didn’t always feel like explaining myself or revealing that I had been dealing with cancer. However, I’m comforted by the fact that this phase in my life won’t last forever.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The graph shows he increase in skin cancer cases over a 25 year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;BCC is far more common than its deadly cousin melanoma, with around 5.4 million diagnoses made every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Generally related to sun exposure, the cancer develops when cells in the upper layer of the skin begin to divide uncontrollably, forming a pinkish patch that might be tender or itchy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors are typically able to remove it via Mohs surgery, which bumps the survival rate up to 99 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's also becoming more common. According to the NIH, case rates have risen between 20 and 80 percent over the last 30 years, especially among the ever-growing senior population.  &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Khorasani continues to perform outpatient procedures to smooth out the scar, including Dermabrasion and CO₂ laser resurfacing, which remove outer skin layers and stimulate collagen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vascular lasers reduce redness by targeting blood vessels, while Bellafill injections fill in raised or indented scars. Botox can prevent scar stretching by relaxing nearby muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Haley said: ‘Nevertheless, the healing process since the surgery hasn’t always been picture-perfect (my scar looks especially red immediately after treatments), but on good days, I’m happy to say that you’d hardly know the scar is there thanks to all the help from my doctor and his team.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since the scare, she has become much more diligent about protecting her skin, reapplying SPF throughout the day, wearing hats and rash guards at the beach, and visiting her dermatologist for comprehensive body exams every six months, as recommended by the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Signs of skin cancer range from innocuous to obvious, but experts warn that treating cases early is key to making sure they do not spread or further develop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The clinic she goes to uses artificial intelligence to analyze high-quality photos of her whole body to determine whether she has developed any cancerous moles. So far, she is cancer-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘After months of walking around with various hats and scar coverings, I no longer worry what other people think of me or how I look,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When someone asks about my scar, I’m happy to share my story. Because if opening up helps even one person catch something early, protect their skin, or feel less alone, then it’s all been worth it. And in the meantime? I’ll be rocking my favorite hat.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 16:38:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNdEktUkpZY250Vjh3WFBJZVhWZERsY01kZlAtUlJtR1JxX1hHbDhKY2VzVjFmaEZEdEJHQ3pleW41MGRVX1gzU2FJWGd0S2loR0tIY1lSamV6d3pPbFp3VWNPMGFZcXZmVDFiUlpucWw1WTRIelR2VlJlaWtmTEVwRG5YZnBOU081VHRNZ25MbVpZLUljTGdmMjBtWGLSAaIBQVVfeXFMTzBwektzNzZvTHc5ZFdMUHVERFA0a3V5YjJjZjBBOEs0cm9hN25hUmZlZVVuaS1wc0NjMkZkOGx2RXA2TjlYY1hhMlpQUUFDVjBkV1dRUkItd0VWNEZmQzFsZzhqZUU1T0NyTlFPNGJfMmtXUy14T0tSZHRqclp2ZkZMbFp4XzQ4VHNuWkNOZDMtS09SYTdvTEw3Qmh0YndRNE9n</guid></item><item><title>亚利桑那州病人在急诊室死于瘟疫- NBC新闻 | Arizona patient dies in emergency room from plague - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQSGZscVE1X1VfMTBqQU5tVi1RS183R1VRcHgzbnZ2QlFnZklMcXhUR3k5S3B5Y093d21xdlZ4dFd0MU1GaWxzUkN4WWJOem1oQjhRZ0NuV1dzWlV5bTJJMG1Ua3ZxVWtucFYzVlFJSVRTUHVYWUMwZFlzMVZOcVJ4UElDWlhVYTZH0gFWQVVfeXFMUFE1c0hEaWVrbUlGSW1YcnJnYjNFWkFJZ3lBeWxDMUtQaTFBV1hEczZfX1FQMlBCcHJKUlhxNjNZMHpmTEdjdTgxQUlQcURKT2EtQ3ExNkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a0231" class="body-graf"&gt;A person in northern Arizona has died from a case of bubonic&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;plague, local health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0aced4" class="body-graf"&gt;The unidentified patient showed up to the Flagstaff Medical Center Emergency Department and died there the same day, Northern Arizona Healthcare said in a statement.

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the popularity of weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy has soared so dramatically that they’ve inspired new vocabulary, spurred global shortages, and prompted moral debates. Prescription growth hit 13% in just three months, with 2 million Americans now using the drug. Marketed as “miracle drugs,” these medications, part of a class called GLP-1 receptor agonists, have transformed how doctors treat diabetes, obesity, and &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/ozempic-users-are-seeing-a-surprising-drop-in-alcohol-and-drug-cravings/"&gt;even addiction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But as millions jump the GLP-1 drug bandwagon, the scale of these drugs’ side effects has become increasingly apparent. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using data from over two million patients, scientists at the Washington University School of Medicine and the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System have built what they call an “atlas” of the drugs’ effects on the human body. The study is one of the most comprehensive investigations yet into GLP-1 drugs, tracking 175 health outcomes across all major organ systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our approach has allowed us to build a comprehensive atlas mapping the associations of GLP-1RA spanning all organ systems,” said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, the study’s senior author and a clinical epidemiologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-potential-benefits"&gt;Potential Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs like semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) were originally designed to mimic hormones that stimulate insulin release, helping patients with type 2 diabetes. But they quickly became famous for their ability to trigger significant weight loss by suppressing appetite and slowing digestion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials showed cardiovascular benefits and improved kidney function. But many of those trials only monitored patients for a few months and tested a narrow range of outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Al-Aly’s team wanted to take a broader view.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, they pulled anonymized data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, focusing on 215,970 people who started taking GLP-1 drugs between 2017 and 2023. They compared their health outcomes to those of over a million people using other diabetes medications or receiving standard care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compared to standard care, GLP-1 drugs were associated with a &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; risk of 42 different conditions, including heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure, respiratory infections, and even Alzheimer’s disease. The drugs also appeared to reduce substance use disorders — including alcohol, cannabis, opioids, and stimulants — and even cut the risk of suicide attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The effect sizes were modest, often ranging between 10% and 20% risk reductions. But across such a wide array of conditions, the cumulative impact could be substantial.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These drugs act on receptors throughout the brain and body,” said Al-Aly. “That might explain why we’re seeing effects far beyond blood sugar or weight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Animal studies support that theory. GLP-1 drugs &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455625/"&gt;reduce inflammation in the brain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8820218/"&gt;interfere with reward pathways&lt;/a&gt; linked to addiction. Human data from the new study suggests they also lower the risk of seizures, bulimia, schizophrenia, and suicidal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s a growing body of research suggesting GLP-1 drugs might serve as adjuvants for treating neuropsychiatric conditions,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And they’re not alone in this speculation. &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/obesity/news/20240715/ozempic-may-protect-against-cognitive-decline-and-addiction"&gt;Other researchers are already exploring&lt;/a&gt; whether these drugs might be used to treat addiction or even prevent cognitive decline in aging populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="but-not-without-risks"&gt;But Not Without Risks&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, no medicine that touches so many systems can do so without consequences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study found an &lt;em&gt;increased&lt;/em&gt; risk for 19 outcomes, some of them serious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Users had higher rates of gastrointestinal problems like nausea, vomiting, GERD (acid reflux), and abdominal pain. More worryingly, they were also more likely to suffer from pancreatitis (a painful and potentially fatal inflammation of the pancreas), kidney stones, and kidney inflammation. The risk of acute drug-induced pancreatitis was more than twice that of non-users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vision changes and other musculoskeletal issues, like arthritis and tendinitis, were also noted. Sleep disturbances, syncope (fainting), and headaches were among the subtler but still significant concerns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These side effects aren’t entirely new. Reports of nausea and “Ozempic face” — a term coined for the rapid facial fat loss some users experience — have circulated for years. But this is the first time such a large and systematic evaluation has mapped the full scope of possible risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ozempic-face.webp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ozempic-face-1024x576.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-286855" srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ozempic-face-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ozempic-face-750x422.webp 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ozempic-face.webp 1099w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rarer side effects may emerge as more patients take these medicines in clinical practice,” &lt;a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weight-loss-drugs-linked-with-growing-number-of-side-effects/a-73229511?maca=en-GK-RSS-en-teaser-Flipboard-Sci_Tech-21405-xml-media"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; Penny Ward, a physician at King’s College London. “This is why we continue to monitor the safety of medicines on the market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the UK, regulators have linked &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/06/26/weight-loss-jabs-linked-pancreas-problems-after-10-deaths/"&gt;at least ten deaths to GLP-1-related pancreatitis&lt;/a&gt;. And while side effects like NAION (a rare optic nerve condition that can cause blindness) remain uncommon, studies now suggest a fourfold increase in risk among diabetic users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-balancing-act"&gt;A Balancing Act&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the concerns, researchers aren’t calling for restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The list of benefits for this drug, if taken as prescribed, is still significantly longer and more impactful than risks,” Karolina Skibicka, a neuroendocrinologist at the University of Calgary, told &lt;em&gt;DW&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But she added an important caveat: “We need studies which include women. Women show unique side-effects to many pharmacotherapies, and still in most studies women are often underrepresented at various stages of testing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s a known limitation of the current study, which was conducted using VA health records, a system whose patient base is disproportionately male. Only about 5% of participants were women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that may not be the only blind spot. Because the drugs are increasingly used for obesity rather than diabetes, the dosages and durations are often higher and longer than in original trials. “More data is needed about those taking the drug for obesity,” Skibicka said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Al-Aly agrees. He emphasizes that the findings should not discourage use but instead guide safer prescriptions and spur targeted research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“GLP-1RA drugs can have broad health benefits,” he said. “However, they are not without risks. Our findings underscore the possibility for wider applications for these medications but also highlight important risks that should be carefully monitored.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="where-do-we-go-from-here"&gt;Where Do We Go from Here?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, the drugs are here to stay. One in eight U.S. adults has already taken a GLP-1 drug at least once, and demand continues to grow globally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the new atlas of side effects and benefits offers a way forward not just for better prescribing practices, but for understanding the full biological reach of a molecule originally intended to control blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As more data emerges, that insight might help scientists repurpose GLP-1 drugs in ways we’re only beginning to imagine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After all, a molecule that reshapes the risk of Alzheimer’s, addiction, and cardiovascular disease, all at once? That’s not something we can afford to easily ignore. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings appeared in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03412-w"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In 2024 alone, global spending on anti-aging products was roughly $74 billion. But what if the key to slower aging and longer life hides in psilocybin, the compound found in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/religious-leaders-tried-psilocybin-and-it-changed-their-lives/"&gt;psychedelic mushrooms&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sounds strange. Yet science now says it might be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emory University&lt;/a&gt; made a surprising discovery. They found that psilocin, a compound your body produces after eating psychedelic mushrooms, could actually slow down aging in cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their study appeared in &lt;em&gt;npj Aging&lt;/em&gt;, and the results stunned even the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-psilocybin-the-basics"&gt;Understanding psilocybin – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the body converts psilocybin into psilocin, it binds to serotonin receptors, altering perception, mood, and cognition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-before-psilocybin-mushrooms-brain-on-psilocybin-mushrooms-any-questions/"&gt;Brain imaging shows&lt;/a&gt; that under psilocybin, rigid brain networks loosen their grip, allowing parts of the brain that don’t usually communicate to connect in unexpected ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rewiring effect can temporarily dissolve the ego and create a sense of unity or interconnectedness, often described as a profound spiritual experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-psilocybin-mushrooms-got-their-magic/"&gt;the magic&lt;/a&gt; isn’t just in the moment – it’s in what comes after. Clinical studies show that a single guided psilocybin session can ease symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD, sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/psilocybin-may-boost-our-ability-to-learn-and-explore/"&gt;with lasting effects&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists believe this happens because psilocybin disrupts entrenched thought loops and gives people a window to view their life and habits from a new angle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined with therapy, it can help someone reframe trauma or break out of destructive mental patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-study-psilocybin-and-aging"&gt;How to study psilocybin and aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers grew human lung and skin cells and added psilocin. Normally, these cells grow &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/healthy-aging-how-some-people-live-past-100-years/"&gt;old&lt;/a&gt; and stop dividing. But this time, something else happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a lower dose, cells lived almost 30% longer. A higher dose pushed that to more than 50%. The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-are-experimenting-with-new-approach-to-fight-and-stop-human-aging-necrosis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cells stayed active&lt;/a&gt;. They kept dividing far longer. They showed fewer signs of stress and less damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treated cells had more sirtuin1, a protein that helps cells survive stress. They also showed less DNA damage. And there was another surprise – these cells kept their telomeres intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Telomere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Telomeres&lt;/a&gt; protect DNA from damage. As people grow older, telomeres shrink, leading to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organ-aging-can-predict-diseases-decades-in-advance/"&gt;age&lt;/a&gt;-related diseases. In this study, psilocin stopped that shrinkage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mice-lived-longer-with-psilocybin"&gt;Mice lived longer with psilocybin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists tossed around the “psilocybin-telomere hypothesis.” They suspected psychedelics could help protect telomeres and slow aging. But no one had ever proved it. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t just a lab trick. The team also tested psilocybin in aging mice, equal in age to 60 to 65-year-old humans. First, the mice got a low dose of psilocybin. Then they received higher doses once a month for ten months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They waited and watched. The outcome was hard to ignore. About 80% of the treated mice survived the entire study. In the untreated group, only half survived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treated mice also looked healthier. They had better fur, fewer white hairs, and even some new hair &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/defying-time-three-ways-to-slow-biological-aging/"&gt;growth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-cells-stay-younger"&gt;How cells stay younger&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psilocybin activates serotonin receptors. These receptors are not just in the brain – they are everywhere in the body. They exist in the heart, lungs, skin, immune cells, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, psilocin boosted &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/sirtuin-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sirtuin1&lt;/a&gt; in cells. This protein helps the body manage oxidative stress. Less stress meant cells stayed younger for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers now believe psilocybin touches many aging pathways. It protects DNA, lowers stress, preserves telomeres, and may slow aging itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-psilocybin-may-improve-aging-even-later"&gt;Psilocybin may improve aging even later&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most cells in the body express &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-dopamine-and-serotonin-shape-behavior/"&gt;serotonin&lt;/a&gt; receptors, and this study opens a new frontier for how psilocybin could influence systemic aging processes, particularly when administered later in life,” said study co-author Dr. Louise Hecker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her words say it all: this isn’t just about mental health anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study opens new questions about what long-term treatments can do. Additionally, even when the intervention is initiated late in life in mice, it still leads to improved survival, which is clinically relevant in healthy aging,” Hecker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message is clear: it’s never too late to change how we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-better-way-to-age"&gt;A better way to age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery comes at a crucial time. A recent report showed that life expectancy in the United States still falls behind other countries. Americans not only live shorter lives but also struggle with quality in later years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study provides strong preclinical evidence that psilocybin may contribute to healthier aging, not just a longer lifespan, but a better quality of life in later years,” says study co-author Dr. Ali John Zarrabi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zarrabi worries about extending life without improving well-being. He doesn’t want people trapped in bodies that no longer work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a palliative care physician-scientist, one of my biggest concerns is prolonging life at the cost of dignity and function. But these mice weren’t just surviving longer. They experienced better aging,” said Zarrabi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His words strike a deep chord. Aging isn’t only about years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-just-the-beginning-for-psilocybin"&gt;Just the beginning for psilocybin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers know their work is just beginning. They must study psilocybin in humans. They need to find the safest doses and study long-term effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are hurdles. Psilocybin is a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/millions-americans-are-microdosing-psilocybin-mdma-cannabis-lsd/"&gt;controlled substance&lt;/a&gt;. Getting approval and funding takes effort. But many researchers remain hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psilocybin already holds FDA “breakthrough therapy” status for depression. This could help speed up future research on aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A psychedelic drug helping people live longer might sound strange. But science rarely cares about what sounds strange. It cares about results. And right now, psilocybin’s results are impossible to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;npj Aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 14:58:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxOd0t4dmJDNlJMemJuR3lPRzN1Q0pndDhUNXZoT3hKMW45RmNfYm5ONlItQkNKS3E5Q0RldTJWSWFZcldtS0s4THgtaDBHbnhFN3N2QzNGamg4R2dhTl8zdWZZcEwwbEluT25HNnpRb1BWMmJvaW15MmpxYU0wSWxodVJjY3Q0WXZyQ3RKdVVFdXh4WlFzWEtnSWhMWDg4TzZzUjRFTnhnakFnVGpzTmNtR3IwSWNpZk0tcmE4</guid></item><item><title>成千上万的人面临慢性疾病的风险，因为错误的测试助长了席卷美国的无声流行病-每日邮报 | Thousands at risk of chronic disease as faulty tests fuel silent epidemic sweeping the US - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQZG5uNXJLbmtIT2Q1bFAxcGtpYmpLNW5INlB4SDB6VlVQNU4yd2czRlNNNERvaEV6NTluODZ4YUsyLUdidEtSd1c3TTNvM1lnVk1XVUNlX0s1aTZoZlRSMm9Rc1h5aU1ZV0F4UWhjMU9vM3lkMV9uX3E0alpCcWprQWFfaWtlTjNVOG0zWHdzZG5PLVFJNUloazE2eUxTTW1uQ01mLXZJdTJSTVnSAbABQVVfeXFMT0NtZE5lRDFyWndJak0tdk9idjM5LUJxZFUzSTQyUkt4M0NYSndtd1VFTFFQUUtySEhUckJlblRGUlFvUGNsSG5QWnVLWkVHOFpaZGUwV0FYRTk0clRLSUlHU05kemlLQXlXYXdyN3Z0a0xXYVJ2VXp6ZnBLWmNaTVpOeGVWdzZWVFJhSzRsZTdiV2JuR2FxekFYLTdpd2gtZG5TNXlnS3lNajRUanNDenA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thousands could be at risk of suffering from a chronic disease this summer simply by skipping the doctor, research has suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 476,000 people are diagnosed &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14727773/Urgent-warning-blood-sucking-parasite-cases-double.html"&gt;with Lyme disease&lt;/a&gt; in the US every year, an infection caught from tick bites that causes muscle pain, brain fog and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But new research from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/oregon/index.html" id="mol-cff676c0-5e61-11f0-8c5c-bd93cc51307e"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; found that only 35 percent of patients who continued to suffer symptoms beyond two months stayed in contact with their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found only 34 percent of patients got a positive result for the disease at their first test, despite all being infected — in another sign tests for the illness are often inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings are the latest blow to current testing methods, which critics have long warned are missing a large chunk of cases, leaving patients undiagnosed and untreated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers are now urging doctors to stay engaged with their Lyme patients and consider a second round of antibiotics for those still suffering symptoms, suggesting the infection may not have been fully cleared the first time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly one to three percent of tick bites lead to Lyme disease, which often begins with a bullseye-shaped rash. But while symptoms usually appear within 3 to 30 days, the illness can quietly linger and wreak havoc if not treated properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lyme disease is rarely fatal, with just 10 deaths reported in the US since 1985, but for those left untreated, the long-term consequences can be devastating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above is a blacklegged tick, or deer tick, which can carry Lyme disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the study, published in the journal Frontiers in Medicine, the researchers extracted data from the Lyme Disease Biobank, which holds blood and saliva samples from people diagnosed with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They examined samples from 253 people from Long Island, New York, and Central Wisconsin, who were infected with Lyme disease between 2014 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All participants received antibiotics to treat their disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, 78 percent said they had no symptoms of Lyme Disease when they returned for their second test two to four weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But among the 22 percent who reported ongoing symptoms, most said they were no longer visiting their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 10 percent of people in North America are thought to&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-10916181/Nearly-10-people-North-America-deadly-tick-borne-illness-Lyme-disease.html"&gt; have been infected&lt;/a&gt; with Lyme disease at least once in their lives, data has shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those individuals have been left with serious complications after battling undiagnosed Lyme disease for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11231295/Woman-29-needs-16-joint-replacements-catching-Lyme-disease.html"&gt;In one case&lt;/a&gt;, Meghan Bradshaw, from Charlotte, North Carolina, revealed it took doctors four years to diagnose her illness, by which time Lyme disease had sparked arthritis in her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Meghan Bradshaw, from Charlotte in North Carolina, suffered what doctors said was the 'worst' case of Lyme disease-triggered arthritis they had seen. It took four years to diagnose her condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now age 32, Bradshaw has already undergone 16 joint replacements due to the infection affecting her shoulders, knees, hips, and ankles &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She now refers to herself as the 'bionic woman' because of all the surgeries, saying she has been practically 'reconstructed' from the waist down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-10875965/Outdoorsy-Father-two-60-left-suffering-memory-problems-Lyme-disease.html"&gt;another case from 2022&lt;/a&gt;, an 'outdoorsy' father-of-two died from Lyme disease after it took doctors nine months to diagnose his condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Russell Bell, then 65 and living in Raleigh, North Carolina, was tested for Lyme disease in 2016 after developing sudden mood swings, but the results came back negative, and doctors instead suspected early-onset Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The computer scientist’s condition worsened over time, leaving him unable to remember alarm codes or solve basic math problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was eventually diagnosed with Lyme disease and began antibiotic treatment, which led to a quick improvement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But just 18 months later, his symptoms returned,and his health began to deteriorate once again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His wife, Nicole, told TODAY in 2022: 'Because Russ was very outdoorsy, and because I knew he had ticks on him over the years, Lyme disease was actually one of the first things that came to mind when I started looking into the symptoms of my husband’s cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[But then] m&lt;span&gt;y husband, Russ, who picked up the kids from school each day, had arrived home and wasn’t able to turn the blaring alarm off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I got home later that day and everything was fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But I noticed Russ asking repetitive questions. Forgetting what time to pick up the kids. And he couldn’t remember the alarm code, the same one we had used for years.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul

programmes – rolled out in response to outbreaks of five major diseases – are believed to have reduced deaths by around 60% over a period of 23 years, according to a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/10/7/e016887" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A similar number of infections are also thought to have been prevented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Researchers believe that vaccinations stopped much bigger outbreaks of illnesses like Ebola, cholera and yellow fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The study also points to the significant economic benefits of vaccination programmes, which run into billions of dollars.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Researchers say this is the first comprehensive study to assess the impact of emergency vaccination programmes in response to the outbreak of five infectious diseases – Ebola, measles, cholera, yellow fever and meningitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They studied 210 different incidents from 2000 to 2023, covering 49 different countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The vaccine roll-outs seem to have had an impressive impact, reducing deaths by nearly 60%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The number of overall cases of theses infections were also reduced by nearly 60%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The swift deployment of vaccines also appears to have halted wider outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There were economic benefits too – worth an estimated $32 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;These benefits come mainly from averting deaths and years of life lost to disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But researchers believe this could be a significant underestimate of overall savings, as it doesn't take into account the costs of dealing with a wider outbreak, or the economic disruption caused by a more serious health emergency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It's believed the 2014 Ebola outbreak, which occurred before the existence of an approved vaccine, is estimated to have cost West African countries alone more than $53 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;The power of

responsible for many of the programmes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Sania Nishtar, the organisation's CEO, says the study shows just how important quick and effective vaccine roll-outs can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"For the first time, we are able to comprehensively quantify the benefit, in human and economic terms, of deploying vaccines against outbreaks of some of the deadliest infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"This study demonstrates clearly the power of vaccines as a cost-effective counter-measure to the increasing risk the world faces from outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It also underscores the importance of fully funding Gavi, so it can continue to protect communities in the next five years to come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Gavi is currently trying to secure a fresh round of funding in the face of global cuts to foreign aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

(WDRB) -- A deceased bat found in Louisville tested positive for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bat was found outside a home in Okolona, in the 40219 zip code, according to a news release Friday from officials with Louisville's health department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials with the Louisville Metro Department of Public Health and Wellness, remind residents that people can get rabies from bats through a bite or from its saliva. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://links-2.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmedia%2Freleases%2F2022%2Fp0106-human-rabies.html%3Futm_medium=email%26utm_source=govdelivery/1/010101917a2e593a-b74421ff-3319-4dd0-9703-a174122f78dc-000000/7ifp-0swE3QVPRxCgYSAUbFZh9zDIyyuks05s6ziYWY=367"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, exposure to rabid bats is the leading cause of rabies in humans in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Transmission of rabies can occur through a bat's bite or the animal's saliva if it gets in a person's eyes, nose, mouth or an open wound," Connie Mendel, Louisville's chief health strategist, said in a news release Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mendel said sometimes people may not even know they've been bitten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly two dozen bats have tested positive for rabies in Jefferson County since 2019. Data from the Public Health and Wellness Lab shows that, since 2019, at least 21 bats have tested positive for rabies in Jefferson County:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2019: 4 bats &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2020: 2 (1 bat, 1 dog) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2021: 7 bats &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2022: 3 bats &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2023: 2 bats &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2024: 4 bats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rabies virus infects the central nervous system, and without appropriate medical care, it can cause disease in the brain which can result in death. &lt;a href="https://links-2.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Frabies%2Fhcp%2Fprevention-recommendations%2Fpost-exposure-prophylaxis.html%3FCDC_AAref_Val=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.cdc.gov%252Frabies%252Fmedical_care%252Findex.html%253Futm_medium%253Demail%2526utm_source%253Dgovdelivery%26utm_medium=email%26utm_source=govdelivery/1/010101917a2e593a-b74421ff-3319-4dd0-9703-a174122f78dc-000000/XxIJvFcfIhHC22jNaHj4V93s3DSkkg_toOaivi7s-p8=367" target="_blank"&gt;Preventative care&lt;/a&gt; after rabies exposure consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin and the rabies vaccine series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures.

Their perception of time became distorted during exercise such that the external clock felt sluggish while their legs were flying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/336590/network"&gt;Andrew M. Edwards&lt;/a&gt;, a sports scientist at &lt;a href="https://www.canterbury.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Canterbury Christ Church University&lt;/a&gt;, led the research alongside collaborators at the &lt;a href="https://www.rug.nl/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Groningen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://vu.nl/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vrije University&lt;/a&gt; of Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-time-is-not-time-during-exercise"&gt;Time is not time during exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise distorts time perception, the everyday sense of how long an event lasts. &lt;a href="https://www.keele.ac.uk/media/keeleuniversity/facnatsci/schpsych/weardenpublications/wearden2003.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Classic scalar expectancy&lt;/a&gt; theory proposes an internal pacemaker that fires pulses; count more pulses and a moment seems longer, count fewer and it shrinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During intense effort, sensory input and body signals grab attention, widening the attentional “gate” so extra pulses slip through and lengthen our subjective perception of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A complementary striatal beat frequency &lt;a href="https://scholarcommons.sc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1298&amp;amp;context=jscas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;model&lt;/a&gt; points to oscillations in the basal ganglia, a deep brain hub that also coordinates movement and reward, as a neural metronome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuro‑imaging shows overlapping circuits for timing and reward anticipation, hinting that the same dopamine‑rich loops flag both pace and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-the-4-kilometer-pedal-test"&gt;Inside the 4‑kilometer pedal test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty‑three recreational riders, none of them cyclists by trade, completed three four‑kilometer trials on a high‑precision ergometer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between sprints they estimated 30 seconds five times, giving a snapshot of the brain’s stopwatch before, during, and after exertion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was no difference between exercise conditions or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/time-has-three-dimensions-and-space-is-just-a-byproduct-according-to-new-theory/"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; points,” the authors reported, emphasizing that competition alone did not reset the internal clock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether they rode solo, chased a passive avatar, or tried to beat an active opponent, the time warp held steady. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After finishing, their estimates snapped back to real‑world accuracy within two minutes, underscoring how tightly the illusion is tied to effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-your-brain-during-exercise"&gt;Your brain during exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart rate climbs, lactate builds, and muscle pain demands focus, pushing athletes toward an associative mindset where every pedal stroke is monitored. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory work with treadmill runners shows that as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28858053/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;rate of perceived exertion&lt;/a&gt; climbs from “somewhat hard” to “very hard,” seconds feel even longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surge in afferent signals may flood cortical networks that normally keep temporal information tidy, so the brain logs more sensory events per unit of real time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrophysiological &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4830363/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; link this overload to elevated activity in supplementary motor areas, cerebellum, and ventral striatum, regions repeatedly flagged in timing meta‑analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because those circuits also help schedule movements, distorted timing could feed back into pacing errors, explaining why novice cyclists often start too hard and fade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-competition-exercise-and-time-perception"&gt;Competition, exercise, and time perception&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many coaches assume that racing a foe distracts athletes from discomfort, shortening perceived &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/time-may-not-just-move-forward-experts-say-it-could-rewind/"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cycling data upend that idea: even when volunteers tried to outsprint a rival and actually finished about 1  seconds quicker, their timing errors matched the solo run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More work has to be done to further unravel the role of external stimuli, exercise intensity, and duration on the perception of time during exercise,” wrote Edwards and colleagues, calling for studies that vary course length and sport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visual pacers such as &lt;a href="https://runningmagazine.ca/the-scene/is-wavelight-technology-good-for-the-sport/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wavelight technology&lt;/a&gt; – a ring of LED lights that guides record attempts in track meets – may offer a stronger cue; analysts note that &lt;a href="https://worldathletics.org/athletes/uganda/joshua-cheptegei-14645612" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Joshua Cheptegei’s 10,000‑meter&lt;/a&gt; world record was set while chasing the moving lights, which kept every kilometer within 0.8 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet even lights cannot erase internal noise completely, so athletes must still learn to calibrate effort against split times displayed on the track or bike computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-have-we-learned"&gt;What have we learned?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing that exercise stretches moments can shape better pacing strategies. Endurance coaches often teach swimmers to rehearse key distances with a metronome or music track so the internal clock anchors to an external beat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyclists can glance at distance markers rather than &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/physicists-make-bold-claims-that-time-is-an-illusion-question-its-existence/"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;, because distance cues remain objective even when seconds feel elastic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For high‑intensity interval training, pre‑programmed timers remove guesswork, preventing premature burnout caused by overestimating rest breaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recreational exercisers may welcome the illusion, after all, a half‑hour ride that feels like forty minutes makes the gym session feel “worth it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-unanswered-questions-and-next-steps"&gt;Unanswered questions and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does the illusion scale with workout length, or plateau after the first surge of pain signals? Would elite athletes, who spend years refining &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1355442/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;interoceptive awareness&lt;/a&gt;, show smaller distortions, or merely learn to ignore them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain‑stimulation studies could temporarily mute motor cortex or cerebellum activity to test causal roles in the effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wearable neuroimaging, now light enough for treadmill use, might map the live interplay between stride cadence, pulse counts, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-explain-why-time-seems-to-fly-by-pass-faster-as-we-age-brain-perception/"&gt;subjective time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until then, the best takeaway is pragmatic: trust the stopwatch, not your feelings, when pacing the final lap or last hill climb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/brb3.3471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brain and Behavior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 13:26:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPQldhSURvakdrajBwOVN4VTBSN1BKWUd4N1FldHpSQk40UUZDYzlPUnhNajJ2NTVpTk9sdnVkYTVJMkFEakpkNHZFS3ROQmFnSE1tblQzODNqQ3dVN09SVFhyMGNfRE4yVlNWSjhZVEhYZWpuUXZzbkdPQXFLS3dxbU82ZldEQkNnRy1adWUwMGlEZmRPMWtzb042VmRPQUxtQ0dXWVI3R28</guid></item><item><title>常见的蔬菜可能会抵消与肥胖相关的大脑变化- PsyPost | A common vegetable may counteract brain changes linked to obesity - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNenVFOVBtc1lRZE5UelB2TzB5dDc2dEo1TjkwanROUUdncUtHRHZzN0pwblNRczF0T0J2X3NqQ3gyVXBaVkxBSHZYN0RmX0x0ZHZlcmFqZWE4UFpFZm5xdDZKb3JpZDluNHgweTNoMF9Lblp2SzM1Y0NYdlFqUkd5YVdjQmthZDhHa2UtcDhrVVZrbWpO?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006899325002008" target="_blank"&gt;Brain Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; suggests that adding okra to the diet can protect against long-term metabolic problems caused by early-life overfeeding. In a rat model, okra supplementation prevented obesity, high blood sugar, and brain inflammation associated with being overnourished during infancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okra, also known as &lt;em&gt;Abelmoschus esculentus&lt;/em&gt;, is a vegetable rich in antioxidants, fiber, and plant compounds believed to have anti-inflammatory and metabolic benefits. While it’s often consumed for its nutritional value, researchers are increasingly interested in its potential to reduce the risk of chronic diseases. The authors of this new study set out to test whether including okra in the diet could protect against metabolic disorders that begin during early development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rationale behind the study stems from concerns about early overnutrition, which has been linked to long-term health problems. When young animals or humans consume more calories than needed during critical periods of development, they can experience lasting changes to their metabolism, body composition, and brain signaling pathways involved in hunger and energy use. One known consequence of early overfeeding is the development of obesity and insulin resistance in adulthood. The researchers aimed to explore whether supplementing the diet with okra could prevent these outcomes by improving inflammation and restoring healthy energy balance in the brain and body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this idea, the researchers used a well-established model of early overfeeding in rats. Shortly after birth, some litters were reduced to just three pups per mother, ensuring that each infant rat had more access to milk and gained weight more rapidly. This small litter (SL) condition is known to simulate early overnutrition. A separate group of litters was maintained at the typical eight pups per mother, serving as the normal litter (NL) control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At three weeks of age, all rats were weaned and assigned to one of two diets: a standard rodent diet or the same diet supplemented with 1.5% okra. This produced four groups in total: normal-litter rats on a standard diet (NL-SD), normal-litter rats on the okra diet (NL-AE), small-litter rats on a standard diet (SL-SD), and small-litter rats on the okra diet (SL-AE). The animals continued on these diets until they reached adulthood at 100 days of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the study, the researchers tracked body weight, food and water consumption, blood sugar levels, fat accumulation, and muscle mass. They also measured insulin sensitivity both in the body and the brain, and examined levels of inflammation-related molecules in the hypothalamus, a brain region that regulates appetite and energy balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, the small-litter rats on the standard diet became obese and showed multiple signs of metabolic dysfunction. These rats ate more food, had higher blood sugar and fat levels, and gained more fat mass compared to their normal-litter peers. They also displayed impaired glucose tolerance and signs of insulin resistance. In addition, these animals had elevated levels of inflammatory molecules—such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1 beta—in the hypothalamus. These molecules are known to interfere with insulin signaling and promote weight gain and metabolic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rats that were overfed early in life but received the okra-supplemented diet showed a very different profile. Despite having the same early nutritional background, they avoided the rise in blood sugar, triglycerides, and cholesterol seen in their standard-fed counterparts. Their total fat mass was reduced, and their muscle mass improved. They also had better results on a glucose tolerance test, suggesting improved control of blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, their brains showed lower levels of inflammatory markers, and they responded to insulin administered directly into the brain—something the overfed rats on a standard diet could not do. This improvement in brain insulin sensitivity was linked to reduced food intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rats in the normal-litter groups, whether they received the okra diet or not, showed no significant differences in weight, fat, glucose, or inflammation, suggesting that okra did not produce major changes in healthy animals, but specifically helped those who were metabolically impaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe that compounds found in okra—such as catechins, quercetin, and other phenolics—may help explain the observed benefits. These plant-based substances are known to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and previous research has suggested they can improve insulin signaling and reduce blood sugar levels. Although the exact mechanisms remain unclear, the results support the idea that functional foods like okra can influence long-term health when introduced early in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study adds to growing evidence that diet in early life has lasting consequences on health and that certain foods may offer protective effects. The findings are especially relevant given the increasing rates of childhood obesity worldwide and the difficulty of reversing its effects in adulthood. While this experiment was conducted in rats and may not directly translate to humans, it raises the possibility that early dietary interventions with plant-based compounds could help prevent or manage metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the authors acknowledge some limitations. They did not examine insulin production or hormone levels in the pancreas, which would have provided more information about how okra affects insulin regulation. They also did not study whether okra directly influences leptin signaling, another important regulator of energy balance. More research is needed to clarify how specific compounds in okra interact with metabolic pathways and whether similar effects can be observed in human populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the study provides evidence for the potential of okra as a dietary supplement to reduce the long-term harm of early overnutrition. By improving both peripheral and brain insulin sensitivity, reducing inflammation, and restoring healthier body composition, okra may serve as a useful component of non-drug strategies to combat obesity and its associated health risks. Future studies in humans will be needed to determine whether similar effects can be achieved and whether okra-based interventions could become part of broader public health approaches to improve lifelong metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2025.149641" target="_blank"&gt;Okra-supplemented diet prevents hypothalamic inflammation in early overfeeding-programmed obese rats&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Camila Luiza Rodrigues dos Santos Ricken, Ginislene Dias, Ingridys Regina Borkenhagen, Adriano Nicoli Roecker, Gisele Facholi Bomfim, Hercules de Oliveira Costermani, Aline Milena Dantas Rodrigues, Nathalia Macedo Sanches, Ester Vieira Alves, Ricardo de Oliveira, and Júlio Cezar de Oliveira.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 13:22:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxNenVFOVBtc1lRZE5UelB2TzB5dDc2dEo1TjkwanROUUdncUtHRHZzN0pwblNRczF0T0J2X3NqQ3gyVXBaVkxBSHZYN0RmX0x0ZHZlcmFqZWE4UFpFZm5xdDZKb3JpZDluNHgweTNoMF9Lblp2SzM1Y0NYdlFqUkd5YVdjQmthZDhHa2UtcDhrVVZrbWpO</guid></item><item><title>8种流行补充剂的危险副作用和风险- Verywell Health | Dangerous Side Effects and Risks of 8 Popular Supplements - Verywell Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxQaGpQclFSb0VoOXlRM2FnSTBFb2tDakY5LUVVVUxuWUE1NllDT0xOSjl5b01YWGFLNXA2VThsSnR3N2NweS1XMXZhUHI5aUZYWmdxSnhKZmNoaVo0T3RUYmlzclRDWHFndDlTX3RNWHJqdGNXRy1NbkwyR2lWdWZQcQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-page_1-0" class="comp health-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content article-content expert-content right-rail__offset lock-journey" data-sc-sticky-offset="60" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[400, 1400, 1400, 1700, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; More than 50% of adults in the United States use dietary supplements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, supplements aren't regulated like medications, so it is essential to be aware of possible dangerous side effects to stay safe and healthy.

The compounds are also linked to decreased risks of dementia, depression, and hypertension.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="10339053" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the expert cautioned: "The key is moderation. Typically, that's one glass a day for women and two for men. More than that can have bad effects on brain health and may make you more likely to get dementia."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What evidence supports this?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers tracked the alcohol habits of 1,709 Copenhagen residents in the 1970s and reassessed them in the 1990s, when they were 65 or older. Over 20 years, 83 developed dementia, and their drinking patterns were compared to those who did not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the study is limited as eating habits and other lifestyle factors were not assessed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Editorial neurologist, John Brust, explained: "Research suggests that wine drinkers may have better dietary habits than beer and liquor drinkers. There is also evidence that dietary vitamin E may reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's. These factors were not accounted for in this study. Nonetheless, this is a provocative report providing evidence that there is indeed something specifically beneficial about wine."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Criticism&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, Dr Sara Imarisio, said: "Understanding the different factors that affect our dementia risk is vital for finding new ways to reduce the number of people who develop the condition in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"While the researchers found that those eating a diet with high levels of flavonoids were less likely to report memory and thinking problems, we should treat these results with caution."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She added: "Dementia is caused by a complex mix of age, genetics and lifestyle factors. From this study alone, we are unable to untangle diet or a specific food component from other lifestyle factors which contribute to dementia risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Cornwall Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 12:59:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPQlZ0R3htcHB6T2I4eWR6OS1DVGhUU0tWVjA0S3JlYlZXYXZzeVgyRTBoenhtV05iZVd5eWNXZWM3dWluQ3RSVVJqTldlTXRKRFF2TTZJY0Nid3JDMUZLb3FJM0lPZUEyaTBnZDNsU0tvVzlGY01BWU5PeUtFWXZFRUJTd1dCT2x5UGRKeFJidU1SOF85WXlIUA</guid></item><item><title>与认知衰退风险相关的常见疼痛药物-神经科学新闻 | Common Pain Medication Linked to Cognitive Decline Risk - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE1sR0ttdVhucmdMOUlka0RMU2dnNVRzR0ZrYVJUUmFLN2EtZVMwdEd5MTNxb0U2VjFxX2VCZmRVd1R2aFlEd195MlZVSnN1M1NrTGZ5cUZhZ3RpNHRmSjdMVGZLZnFLazRtWjFuZjA1N1U5TTg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A large U.S. medical records study has found that adults prescribed gabapentin six or more times for chronic low back pain face significantly higher risks of dementia (29%) and mild cognitive impairment (85%) within 10 years. The risks were especially pronounced in younger adults aged 35–64, where rates of cognitive decline more than doubled or tripled compared to those not on the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest a dose-response relationship, with more frequent prescriptions correlating with higher risks. While observational and not proof of causation, the study underscores the need to monitor patients on long-term gabapentin for signs of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adults prescribed gabapentin ≥6 times were 29% more likely to develop dementia and 85% more likely to develop mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Risks were more than doubled in 35–64 year olds compared to unprescribed peers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The more prescriptions filled, the higher the risk of cognitive decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;BMJ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Receiving six or more prescriptions of the drug gabapentin for low back pain is associated with significantly increased risks of developing dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)–29% and 85%, respectively—finds a large medical records study published online in the journal &lt;em&gt;Regional Anesthesia &amp;amp; Pain Medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, these risks were more than twice as high in those normally considered too young to develop either condition—18-64 year olds—the findings indicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111563"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and pill bottle." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Those who had received six or more gabapentin prescriptions were 29% more likely to be diagnosed with dementia and 85% more likely to be diagnosed with MCI within 10 years of their initial pain diagnosis. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike opioids, gabapentin has relatively low addictive potential, and it has become increasingly popular for the treatment of chronic pain, especially neuropathic pain, as it offers potentially neuroprotective benefits, point out the researchers&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But concerns are beginning to emerge about its side effects, including a possible association with neurodegeneration, although the findings to date have been mixed, including if particular age groups might be more vulnerable they add.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a bid to shed more light on these issues, the researchers drew on real-time data from TriNetX, a federated health research network, which contains electronic health records from 68 healthcare organisations across the USA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They scrutinised the anonymised records of adult patients who had and hadn’t been prescribed gabapentin (26,414 in each group) for chronic low pain between 2004 and 2024, taking account of demographics, co-existing conditions, and the use of other analgesic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who had received six or more gabapentin prescriptions were 29% more likely to be diagnosed with dementia and 85% more likely to be diagnosed with MCI within 10 years of their initial pain diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when the records were stratified by age, 18–64 year olds prescribed the drug were more than twice as likely to develop either condition than those who hadn’t been prescribed gabapentin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there was no heightened risk among 18–34 year olds prescribed the drug, the risks  of dementia more than doubled and those of MCI more than tripled among 35–49 year olds prescribed it. A similar pattern was observed among 50–64 year olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risks also rose in tandem with prescription frequency: patients with 12 or more prescriptions were 40% more likely to develop dementia and 65% more likely to develop MCI than those prescribed gabapentin between 3 and 11 times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an observational study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. The researchers also acknowledge that their study was retrospective, and they weren’t able to account for dose or length of gabapentin use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, they conclude: “Our findings indicate an association between gabapentin prescription and dementia or cognitive impairment within 10 years. Moreover, increased gabapentin prescription frequency correlated with dementia incidence.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They add: “Our results support the need for close monitoring of adult patients prescribed gabapentin to assess for potential cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuropharmacology and cognitive decline research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#39545c5d50584b5c55584d5056574a795b5453175a5654" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hannah Ahmed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://bmj.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BMJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Hannah Ahmed – BMJ&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://rapm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/07/02/rapm-2025-106577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Risk of dementia following gabapentin prescription in chronic low back pain patients&lt;/a&gt;” by Chong H Kim et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regional Anesthesia &amp;amp; Pain Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk of dementia following gabapentin prescription in chronic low back pain patients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-1"&gt;Gabapentin is widely used to treat chronic pain, but its association with cognitive decline and dementia remains unclear. This study examined whether gabapentin prescription is associated with dementia in adults with chronic low back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-2"&gt;We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX national database of de-identified patient records from 2004 to 2024. Adults diagnosed with chronic low back pain were included; those with prior gabapentin use, dementia, epilepsy, stroke, or cancer were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-2"&gt;Propensity score matching controlled for demographics, comorbidities, and pain medications. Patients were stratified by age and gabapentin prescription frequency. Primary outcomes were dementia and mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-3"&gt;26,416 adults we analyzed following propensity-score matching. Patients with six or more gabapentin prescriptions had an increased incidence of dementia (RR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.18–1.40) and mild cognitive impairment (RR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.63–2.10). When stratified by age, non-elderly adults (18–64) prescribed gabapentin had over twice the risk of dementia (RR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.75–2.51) and mild cognitive impairment (RR: 2.50; 95% CI: 2.04–3.05) compared to those not prescribed gabapentin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-3"&gt;Risk increased further with prescription frequency: patients with 12 or more prescriptions had a higher incidence of dementia (RR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.25–1.57) and mild cognitive impairment (RR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.42–1.91) than those prescribed gabapentin 3–11 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-4"&gt;Gabapentin prescription in adults with chronic low back pain is associated with increased risk of dementia and cognitive impairment, particularly in non-elderly adults.

			&lt;p&gt;We celebrate our birthdays on the same day each year, but the truth is that different parts of our bodies are aging &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-body-can-be-younger-than-you-are-heres-how-thats-possible"&gt;at different speeds&lt;/a&gt;. New research suggests brain age could be a strong predictor for lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This comes from a team from Stanford University, who applied a blood analysis technique on records of 44,498 individuals in a UK health research database, aged between 40 and 70 years old. The analysis gave them an estimated biological age for 11 key organs in the body, including the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These organ ages were then compared against the health records of the participants, for up to 17 years. Generally, the more 'aged' organs a participant had, the higher their risk of dying within the follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-age-faster-at-2-specific-times-in-their-life-study-finds?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Humans Age Faster at 2 Specific Times in Their Life, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If one organ had to be chosen as the best single representative, it would be the brain: the data showed that people with a younger brain age tended to have a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/record-breaking-human-lifespans-predicted-by-the-year-2060-heres-why"&gt;longer lifespan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The brain is the gatekeeper of longevity," &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/07/brain-mortality.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Tony Wyss-Coray, from Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you've got an old brain, you have an increased likelihood of mortality. If you've got a young brain, you're probably going to live longer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blood test used here works by measuring protein levels, and matching those proteins to the organs that produce them. Through some complex calculations, this indicates how well &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-just-mapped-our-bodys-organs-in-exquisite-detail"&gt;each organ is functioning&lt;/a&gt; – whether they're working more like a brand new, souped-up sports car, or a dilapidated old vehicle on the verge of collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167513" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167513" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/OrganAnalysis.jpg" alt="Organ age chart" class="wp-image-167513 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/OrganAnalysis.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/OrganAnalysis-586x415.jpg 586w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/OrganAnalysis-600x425.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167513" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Researchers estimated the age of 11 different organs in the body. (Se-Hwee Oh, &lt;em&gt;Nat. Med.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, the older an organ was – essentially, the more wear and tear indicated by its proteins – the more likely the chances of disease in that organ. The greater the number of 'elderly' organs, the greater the likelihood of disease or an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/boosting-exercise-intensity-reduces-mortality-risk-study-suggests"&gt;early death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the brain stats that really stood out though. People with "extremely aged" brains (in the top 7 percent in terms of old age) were almost twice as likely to die over a 15-year period, compared to those whose biological brain ages were more in line with their chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with "extremely youthful" brains had a 40 percent lower risk of dying within the study period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were other interesting associations too:  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="167510" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease was around 3.1 times more likely in extremely aged brains compared to normally aged brains. Extremely youthful brains, meanwhile, were 74 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer's than those closer to chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that a whole host of factors combine to increase or decrease our chances of dying or developing diseases, and previous studies have shown that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/poverty-may-accelerate-brain-aging-study-shows"&gt;poverty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-witness-patients-brains-de-aging-after-changing-their-diet"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-habits-can-keep-your-brain-looking-young-at-70"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; might all have an impact on brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And brain aging is just one variable linked to lifespan – everything from how carefully you cross the road to your eating habits adds up to determine how long &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lifespan-is-shaped-more-by-your-choices-than-your-genes-study-finds"&gt;you're going to live&lt;/a&gt;, so we can't say brain aging is the direct cause here. What's more, there's likely to be two-way feedback here, with disease also contributing to organ aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's important to understand which variables can make the most difference, and to get as full a picture as possible of the contributors to disease and mortality, in order to maximize our chances of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-pinpointed-the-best-diets-to-boost-healthy-aging"&gt;aging healthily&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This approach could lead to human experiments testing new longevity interventions for their effects on the biological ages of individual organs in individual people," &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/07/brain-mortality.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Wyss-Coray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The cost will come down as we focus on fewer key organs, such as the brain, heart and immune system, to get more resolution and stronger links to specific diseases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03798-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Of the studied population, 7.8% met the definition of “healthy aging.” These women lived to age 70 and were free from 11 major chronic diseases, had no memory or physical function impairments, and had good mental health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Carbohydrates were one of the most influential factors. Consuming more total carbohydrates and more “high-quality” carbs (from foods like whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes) during midlife was positively linked with healthy aging. On the flip side, consuming more “refined” carbs (from added sugars, refined grains like white flour, etc.) was linked with lower odds of healthy aging.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We’ve all heard that different carbohydrates can affect health differently, whether for weight, energy or blood sugar levels,” Andres Ardisson Korat, the lead author of the study, said in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250516133230.htm" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a press release" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685ab10ee4b0103c0b538a18" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250516133230.htm" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;a press release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “But rather than just look at the immediate effects of these macronutrients, we wanted to understand what they might mean for good health 30 years later. Our findings suggest that carbohydrate quality may be an important factor in healthy aging.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It sounds ground-breaking, but according to Chan, the research simply adds to a growing list of studies showing that dietary fiber — a type of carbohydrate — is king.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Maria Korneeva via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Maria Korneeva via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Dietary fiber can be found in all fresh fruits and vegetables.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to know about dietary fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When we look overall at any sort of nutrition research, or if we’re comparing specific diets or things like that, the thing that typically always rings true is the fiber content of it,” Chan explained. “From an overall metabolic standpoint, from a cardiovascular standpoint, from just an overall health metric standpoint, fiber is going to be the one thing that’s going to be health-promoting in every single area.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fiber helps keep your &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/healthy-eating/fiber-helps-diabetes.html#cdc_generic_section_2-types-of-fiber" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="bowel movements regular" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685ab10ee4b0103c0b538a18" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/healthy-eating/fiber-helps-diabetes.html#cdc_generic_section_2-types-of-fiber" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;bowel movements regular&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9787832/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="feeds the beneficial bacteria" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685ab10ee4b0103c0b538a18" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9787832/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;feeds the beneficial bacteria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (read: probiotics) that make up your gut microbiome, among other perks, said registered dietician &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gero.usc.edu/faculty/kreutzer/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Cary Kreutzer" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685ab10ee4b0103c0b538a18" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://gero.usc.edu/faculty/kreutzer/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cary Kreutzer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;an instructional professor of clinical gerontology and pediatrics at the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology.

Getting your fill of carbs from fiber-rich whole grains, fruits and vegetables, beans and legumes, and nuts and seeds means you’ll also score essential vitamins and minerals (think: iron, B vitamins) that are health-promoting, she noted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though the study was produced by researchers affiliated with renowned institutions like Tufts University and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, there are some limitations to keep in mind. The study population was only female nurses, who were predominantly white and well-educated, so the findings may not be generalized to a more diverse population. The data also show connections — not clear cause and effect. “I think one of the issues with it is that when we’re looking at big cohorts of data like that, we can’t put people in a vacuum; we can’t put them in a room for 20 years,” Chan said. “So I would say it’s more of an associative effect.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s important to consider how access might play a role in the results, too. “Is it, basically, the economic and financial and time privilege of those individuals that’s also creating some more of these positive health outcomes that we’re seeing, or is it just the whole grains? Obviously, in a longitudinal cohort study, we can’t really specifically study that,” Chan said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Considering the well-studied benefits of fiber, however, it’s worth prioritizing in your diet. Fewer than &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutrition.org/most-americans-are-not-getting-enough-fiber-in-our-diets/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="10% of Americans" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685ab10ee4b0103c0b538a18" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://nutrition.org/most-americans-are-not-getting-enough-fiber-in-our-diets/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;&lt;span&gt;10% of Americans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; get the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="recommended amount of fiber each day" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685ab10ee4b0103c0b538a18" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;&lt;span&gt;recommended amount of fiber each day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (14 grams per 1,000 calories). To Chan, one of the simplest ways to amp up your intake is to flip your mindset. Ask yourself, “What can I add to my plate that’s beneficial?” rather than, “What can I cut out that’s ‘bad’?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When we look at our relationship with food, the more that we focus on what we shouldn’t be doing, the more we end up only thinking about that, and it becomes hyper-restrictive, and then we end up feeling guilty about the decisions that we make,” Chan said. Seek out ways to incorporate another fruit into your breakfast, veggie into your midday snack or whole grain (e.g., barley, farro, brown rice, quinoa) into your dinner. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

Of course, chronic health conditions are multifactorial, and prioritizing fiber-rich foods is just one element of prevention. If you’re able, regularly meet with your health care provider to check your blood pressure, cholesterol and other metrics, she recommends. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Changing your eating habits can feel overwhelming and, to some middle-aged folks, too late to make a difference. But making small tweaks now could have a big impact on your health down the line. “I think many people think, ‘What’s going to happen to me is going to happen to me, and I don’t have control,’” Kreutzer said. “I think people need to know that they can make those changes now, and it potentially can add years to their life.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 11:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNZ3pxOU54dWZRZnlXdV9ZQnVZSU1oUmx1U09WYlNsUk9qek5JOXpCMElZcUkyUzZQX3J3T1ZsLXJPeEtITWthaWVJZENUOFNWeVU0d3Q1Vnhya1FhclcxbHpLckRtTlFUZmpYbHZOMVE1X0pqVEF3UHpBNl95ZnpNbkUwQkhhdTBCNUk1NFFnTGvSAZYBQVVfeXFMTmd6MktfWEJOYUw4MFV6MVF2TF9PTkhEb0J4d25QTEZkd0hPZFVsYXJDSlBNRHlkQ0JJSEszY18wd2lBVURnS1lhVEpLYTZ6ZDR2QnhzWThuczA4anVSQmxNUmxoZmJ3SzZVek1tbzRDZldOR3NBbzRhLU12NDJhWkdCNmhTaGp5ZVFIbXJ6amUtS3psaFh3</guid></item><item><title>数学模型揭示了人类如何使用“随机树”存储叙事记忆- Medical Xpress | Mathematical model reveals how humans store narrative memories using 'random trees' - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNcEpDUEYtdkw3NkFQam5LWlBvMU9OamZlR20wR0I5NklJenNZT2lSWlZQNl81QXBQRlZCVDBFZGRqNXp4VmdqOEQtLXBwQjlHUndQa0h5RGJzRy01V1cwQ0JvWEVSNVgzYUZEck9raGVuWWtIaHBicHV0YVRqWDh1NWlYUzQzcURZYWJYM3lvM3E1ZXhB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans can remember various types of information, including facts, dates, events and even intricate narratives. Understanding how meaningful stories are stored in people's memory has been a key objective of many cognitive psychology studies.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Institute for Advanced Study, Emory University and the Weizmann Institute of Science recently set out to model how humans represent meaningful narratives and store them in their &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/memory/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;, using &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mathematical+objects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mathematical objects&lt;/a&gt; known as "random trees." Their paper, &lt;a href="https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/g1cz-wk1l" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Physical Review Letters&lt;/i&gt;, introduces a new framework for the study of human memory processes, which is rooted in mathematics, computer science and physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study was aimed at solving a key challenge, namely creating a mathematical theory of human memory for meaningful material, such as narratives," Misha Tsodyks, senior author of the paper, told Medical Xpress. "The kind of consensus in the field is that narratives are too complex for such a theory to be possible, but I believe we proved this to be wrong—that despite the complexity, there are statistical trends in the way people recall narratives that can be predicted by a few simple basic principles."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To effectively model the representation of meaningful memories using random trees, Tsodyks and his colleagues used &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/online+platforms/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;online platforms&lt;/a&gt; like Amazon and Prolific to perform recall experiments on a large number of subjects, using narratives borrowed from a paper by W. Labov. Essentially, they asked 100 people to recall 11 narratives of various lengths (ranging from 20 to 200 sentences) and later analyzed recorded recalls to test their theory.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"We chose a collection of spoken narratives recorded by a famous linguist W. Labov in the 1960s," explained Tsodyks. "We quickly realized that analyzing this amount of data requires modern AI tools in the form of recently developed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/large+language+models/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;large language models&lt;/a&gt; (LLMs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We then discovered that people don't simply recall various events from the narratives but often summarize relatively large parts of a narrative (such as episodes) in single sentences. This gave rise to an idea that a narrative is represented in memory as a tree where nodes that are closer to the root represent an abstract summary of larger episodes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tsodyks and his colleagues hypothesized that a tree representing a narrative is first constructed when an individual first hears or reads a story and understands it. As past studies suggest that individuals comprehend the same narratives differently, then the resulting trees would have unique structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We formulated a model as an ensemble of random trees of a particular structure," said Tsodyks. "The beauty of this model is that it can be solved mathematically, and its predictions can be directly tested with the data, which we did. The main novelty of our random tree model of memory and recall is the assumption that any meaningful material is generically represented in the same fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study could have broader implications of this fact for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+cognition/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human cognition&lt;/a&gt; because narratives seem to be a general way we reason about a wide range of phenomena in our individual lives and social and historical processes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent work by this team of researchers highlights the promise of mathematical approaches and AI-based techniques for studying how humans store and represent meaningful information in their memories. In their next studies, Tsodyks and his colleagues plan to assess the extent to which their theory and random tree modeling approach could apply to other types of narratives, such as fiction stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A more ambitious direction for future research will be to find more direct proofs for the tree model," added Tsodyks. "This would require designing other experimental protocols beyond simple recall. Brain imaging with people engaged in narrative comprehension and recall could be another interesting direction."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Millions of Americans have high cholesterol, which increases their risk of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart health experts say there are natural strategies that may help lower cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While these won’t necessarily replace medication, they might help reduce your numbers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Got high cholesterol? You’re in good company. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, roughly 25 million U.S. adults have high cholesterol, or a total blood cholesterol level of 240 mg/dL or above.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That doesn’t mean you have to live with it, though. Heart-health experts say there are steps you can take naturally to bring down your numbers, and we’re going to share them with you. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, we’re not suggesting that these strategies are a replacement for medication. But every little step you can take to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-break-for-lower-cholesterol-8749670" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce your cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; is one step closer to better heart health. Why? “Higher circulating cholesterol is associated with higher rates of atherosclerosis, or deposition of cholesterol in the blood vessels,” says cardiologist &lt;a href="https://www.nationaljewish.org/doctors-departments/minisha-kochar" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Minisha Kochar, M.D.&lt;/a&gt; “This includes the arteries of the heart as well as arteries that supply blood to other organs such as the brain.” In other words, having high cholesterol increases your risk of both heart disease and stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although experts once believed that eating cholesterol in food caused high cholesterol in the blood, we now know that other dietary factors are actually more impactful. One of the most effective pieces of advice: &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/52642/5-easy-ways-to-eat-more-fiber/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eat more fiber&lt;/a&gt;, especially the soluble kind.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Soluble fiber binds to bile acids in the intestine and helps eliminate them from the body,” says cardiology dietitian &lt;a href="http://entirelynourished.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein, M.S., RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. “Since bile acids are made from cholesterol, this forces the liver to use more cholesterol to replace them, lowering blood cholesterol levels.” Several studies have found that the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11734788" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;higher people’s fiber intake&lt;/a&gt;, the lower their cholesterol (both total cholesterol and the artery-clogging kind called LDL cholesterol).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Not surprisingly, research has found that increasing your fiber intake may reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease and stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  To add more soluble fiber to your plate, Routhenstein recommends &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8038825/high-fiber-whole-grain-recipes-to-make-forever/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;foods like oats, barley, beans&lt;/a&gt;, lentils, apples and pears.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-work-out-regularly"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Work Out Regularly &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Want to bring your cholesterol down and improve your mood while you’re at it? Get thee to the gym! Physical activity increases favorable HDL cholesterol, which helps transport harmful LDL cholesterol back to the liver for processing and removal. This ultimately improves overall cholesterol balance, says Routhenstein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Almost any type of workout can be beneficial. Both &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290619/trying-to-lose-weight-heres-why-strength-training-is-as-important-as-cardio/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weight training and aerobic exercise&lt;/a&gt; have been linked to decreases in total and LDL cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, if you also want to increase your HDL, consider adding moderate- to high-intensity exercise, such as distance running or swimming, to your routine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re wondering how much is enough, the American Heart Association recommends 150 minutes of cardio exercise weekly. Feel free to break that down in whatever way is most convenient for you. Whether that’s 10 15-minute brisk walks or five 30-minute spin sessions, either works.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-if-you-smoke-seek-help-quitting"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. If You Smoke, Seek Help Quitting &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re a smoker, quitting can be hard, but it’s worth pursuing. Research has shown that smokers have roughly 3% higher total cholesterol and nearly 7% lower HDL cholesterol levels than nonsmokers. In addition, their triglyceride levels are roughly 10% to 15% higher than those of people who don’t smoke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides cigarettes’ influence on your cholesterol and triglycerides, there’s another not-so-nice element that further magnifies their impact on cardiovascular disease risk. “The toxins in cigarettes damage the lining of the blood vessels, making cardiovascular disease more likely,” says Kochar. The good news is that breaking the habit can help HDL rebound to healthier levels and may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-reduce-your-risk-of-stroke-11698358" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-limit-added-sugars"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Limit Added Sugars &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Added sugars from sodas, cookies, candy, pastries and the like don’t just provide empty calories. They may promote weight gain, a known risk factor for high cholesterol. Research also shows that excessive sugar consumption could mess with your cholesterol more directly. For instance, one older review study linked &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/food-you-should-limit-to-help-lower-triglycerides-11739500" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;greater sugar intake to higher LDL&lt;/a&gt; and lower HDL cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; More recent research has found that people who drink lots of sugar-sweetened beverages like sodas and fruity drinks are more likely to have high LDL and low HDL than those who don’t usually consume sugary beverages.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If sweet drinks are your go-to, try adding a splash of fruit juice to sparkling water or iced tea instead of drinking soda or sweet tea. When you need to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7933746/diabetes-friendly-desserts-to-make-forever/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;satisfy your sweet tooth&lt;/a&gt;, try a small square of dark chocolate. One study found it helped improve LDL cholesterol in people with diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Eat More Plant Sterols and Stanols &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What are plant sterols and stanols, and why should you eat more of them? “Plant sterols and stanols are naturally occurring compounds that block the absorption of cholesterol in the digestive tract,” Routhenstein explains.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because of this mechanism, these friendly compounds have a well-established track record of lowering cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You’ll find small amounts of them in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031247/healthy-whole-grains-to-eat-more-fiber/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;foods like nuts, seeds, whole grains&lt;/a&gt;, legumes, vegetables and vegetable oils. However, to get the 2 to 3 grams that have been shown to reduce cholesterol up to 12%, you’ll need to supplement these foods with stanol- or sterol-fortified foods. Look for specially labeled fortified products, which are often found in foods like margarine, cheese, milk and juice.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research is still teasing apart the exact effects of saturated fat on heart health. But for now, the AHA continues to recommend limiting this nutrient for the sake of your cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Routhenstein concurs. “Cutting back on foods like fatty meats, full-fat dairy, butter and processed snacks can significantly lower LDL and reduce cardiovascular risk,” she says. The AHA’s official guidance is to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7899866/top-sources-of-saturated-fat-in-our-diets/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;limit saturated fats&lt;/a&gt; to less than 6% of total daily calories. For someone who eats roughly 2,000 calories per day, that’s about 13 grams.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heart-health experts say strategies like eating more fiber and plant sterols and stanols, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8023717/no-sugar-meal-plan-lower-cholesterol/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;limiting sugar and saturated fat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7866755/best-exercises-for-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;working out regularly&lt;/a&gt; can all naturally help lower cholesterol. If you smoke, quitting is also one of the best things you can do. In some cases, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8030938/supplements-you-shouldnt-be-taking-if-you-have-high-cholesterol/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;medications like statins&lt;/a&gt; will still be necessary. “Even with the healthiest lifestyle, [normal cholesterol] can be difficult to achieve without medication,” says Kochar. This is especially true for people with a genetic predisposition to high cholesterol, she says. If healthy habits aren’t bringing down your numbers, be sure to follow your health care provider’s guidance regarding medication and the best cholesterol-lowering regimen for your unique needs.&lt;br&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;The most common chronic health conditions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;While the prevalence of chronic conditions can vary with age, many of the same health issues commonly affect adults over 50.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;For example, the Preventing Chronic Disease report found that the most frequently reported conditions for adults in midlife (ages 35 to 64) were obesity (37 percent), &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/high-cholesterol-medication-options/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/common-chronic-conditions.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="cholesterol medications"&gt;high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; (37 percent), and high blood pressure (35 percent). And for adults 65 and older, the top three were blood pressure (61 percent), high cholesterol (55 percent) and &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/arthritis-in-america-cdc-report/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/common-chronic-conditions.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="arthritis"&gt;arthritis&lt;/a&gt; (51 percent).&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a different CDC report, published in June, found that adults 85 and older most commonly experienced high blood pressure (67 percent), arthritis (56 percent) and high cholesterol (46 percent).&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;Ardeshir Hashmi, M.D., endowed chair of geriatric innovation and section chief at the Center for Geriatric Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, says &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/hearing-resource-center/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/common-chronic-conditions.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="hearing resources"&gt;hearing loss&lt;/a&gt; is another common condition he sees among older individuals; according to the National Institute on Aging, it affects about one-third of older adults. But despite its prevalence, patients are often reluctant to discuss hearing troubles with their doctor, he says, because “folks feel like nothing much can be done about it,” adding that “a little bit of it is a stigma that is also associated with it.”&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;Allowing hearing loss to go untreated, however, can lead to other health issues: It increases the risk for depression, dementia, &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/diseases-linked-to-loneliness/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/common-chronic-conditions.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="loneliness"&gt;social isolation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/deadly-falls/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/common-chronic-conditions.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="deadly falls"&gt;falls&lt;/a&gt;. Hearing aids, medication and surgery are some treatments that can help with hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Another condition not to be overlooked among older adults is &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/what-is-depression/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/common-chronic-conditions.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="depression"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, which affects nearly 20 percent of adults ages 35 to 64 and nearly 15 percent of people 65-plus, according to the Preventing Chronic Disease report. Hashmi says depression can be overlooked in older patients because it doesn’t always present the same way as it does in young adults.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;For example, instead of losing sleep, older adults with depression might sleep too much. Hashmi says another sign of depression in an older person could be a lack of pleasure in everyday things they previously looked forward to.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;And while &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/what-is-dementia/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/common-chronic-conditions.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="dementia"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; is rare in patients ages 50 to 64, Thomas Gill, M.D., professor of medicine and epidemiology at the Yale School of Medicine, notes that it’s not unlikely to see it in older patients, notably those 85 and older. “We’re more effective in managing conditions like &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/heart-disease/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/common-chronic-conditions.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="heart disease"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, and so people are living into older ages,” when dementia is more likely to occur, he says. The CDC report states that an estimated 12 percent of adults 85 and older had dementia in 2022-23.&lt;/p&gt;
            
        &lt;/div&gt;

But University College London scientists estimate this will rise to 1.7 million within two decades as people live longer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists believe that copper-rich foods may help regulate the release of neurotransmitters in the brain that are closely related to learning and memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dementia affects an estimated one million people in the UK and has a variety of causes, such as Alzheimer's disease and reduced blood flow to the brain following a stroke, known as vascular dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team said that the links between dietary copper intake and cognitive function are complex, but highlighted energy metabolism and neurotransmission as potential reasons why copper can help protect brain function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is thought that a lack of copper may accelerate the cognitive collapse that is associated with dementia—for instance memory loss, language difficulties and problems with thinking and reasoning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers warned that whilst copper is essential for optimal brain functioning, too much copper can be toxic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-9d06e230-5e3f-11f0-a676-a3ed8ca42684" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14896123/nutrient-cheap-diet-dementia.html"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the longitudinal study, using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2420 American adults were analysed to see how dietary copper intake affected cognitive function, especially in participants with a history of stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the American Heart Association, having a stroke may triple someone's risk for developing dementia within the following year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants' were tracked for for four years and dietary copper intake was determined by averaging two 24 hour dietary recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cognitive function was also assessed by a range of golden metrics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers concluded that those who consumed the most copper had the highest cognitive scores—after accounting for various confounding factors such as age, sex, alcohol intake and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers concluded: 'Our findings indicate a potential association between dietary copper intake and enhanced cognitive function in American older adults, particularly among those with a history of stroke.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers noted that further research is needed to confirm these findings, with a major drawback of the study being that they used self-reported dietary reviews. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's Research UK analysis found 74,261 people died from dementia in 2022 compared with 69,178 a year earlier, making it the country's biggest killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as new research warns that millions of people could be up to a third more likely to develop the memory robbing disease because of their tap water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14274407/27-MILLION-Britons-soft-water-dementia.html"&gt;

Treating &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/10k-steps-a-day-walking-b2735565.html"&gt;10,000 steps per day&lt;/a&gt; as the gold standard for a healthy lifestyle is far more contentious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number stems from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer called the Manpo-Kei, or “10,000 steps metre”. It’s a nice round number, but it’s not one identified by science as the holy grail for health – a 2023 study by the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ugr.es/en/about/news/how-many-steps-take-each-day-reduce-risk-premature-death8000"&gt;University of Granada&lt;/a&gt; suggests that, while more is better, 8,000 is sufficient “to significantly reduce the risk of premature death”​​. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/walking"&gt;Walking&lt;/a&gt; 10,000 steps also takes a fair old while. Even at a decent nick, this task is likely to take you upwards of 90 minutes each day, making it a struggle for busy folks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1kv918u-0 cDsnpW"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-hKDTPf hmBpZX"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7Ehvq-bm6I"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, an alternative walking protocol – colloquially termed “Japanese walking” due to its country of origin – has stepped into the spotlight online. It takes just 30 minutes per day, with fitness coach and content creator &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/coacheugeneteo/?hl=en"&gt;Eugene Teo&lt;/a&gt; claiming it offers “10 times the benefits” of walking 10,000 steps per day in his viral video above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fitness writer, I’ve covered walking extensively, finding it’s one of the best ways to help people of all fitness levels introduce more movement into their regular routine. So, intrigued, I endeavoured to try “Japanese walking” and find out if the impressive health claims around it held water.&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/K7Ehvq-bm6I"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to try the ‘Japanese walking’ method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete the sequence below five times without any breaks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 dDVXDN jHvNZk"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three minutes of walking at a low intensity (40 per cent peak aerobic capacity, or a relaxed pace) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three minutes of walking at a high intensity (70 per cent peak aerobic capacity, or a brisk pace) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Japanese walking” protocol comes from a study published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17605959/"&gt;Mayo Clinic Proceedings&lt;/a&gt; journal in 2007. It was designed to test whether high-intensity interval walking training (IWT) can offer greater benefits than moderate-intensity continuous walking training, in terms of improving thigh muscle strength, peak aerobic capacity (the maximum amount of oxygen you can take in and use during exercise) and blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over five months, 60 men and 186 women with an average age of 63 were divided into three groups; no walking training, IWT and CWT (continuous walking training). The CWT group was instructed to walk at 50 per cent of their peak aerobic capacity (a fairly slow pace) and take 8,000 or more steps per day at least four times per week. The IWT group was told to complete the protocol above, four or more times per week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among participants who met these conditions, those in the IWT group saw a 13 per cent increase in isometric knee flexion, a 17 per cent increase in isometric knee flexion, and an eight per cent increase in peak aerobic capacity for walking. This was “significantly greater than the increases observed in the moderate-intensity continuous walking training group”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also found a greater reduction in resting systolic blood pressure in the IWT group, despite the fact they didn’t spend as much time walking each week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion states: “high-intensity interval walking may protect against age-associated increases in blood pressure and decreases in thigh muscle strength and peak aerobic capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/japanese-walking-trend-weight-loss-b2759539.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The latest walking trend that could help burn more calories and lower blood pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/japanese-walking-trend-weight-loss-b2759539.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 djDghv"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Walking is one of the most accessible forms of movement, offering impressive health benefits" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-39650"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Walking is one of the most accessible forms of movement, offering impressive health benefits&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (David Lovelady)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened when I tried Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a full science lab set up at home; what I do have is two legs, a &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-garmin-watch-b1903982.html"&gt;Garmin watch&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of walking experience, so I decided to put these to good use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my Monday lunch break, I took my dog for a 30-minute walk as normal. Then, at 1pm the following day, I tried the “Japanese walking” method on the same looped route, setting my Garmin Vivoactive to record both sessions and taking note of any subjective changes I felt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My usual 30-minute walk saw me accrue nearly 3,000 steps, covering 2.12km at an average speed of 14min 10sec per kilometre. My heart rate averaged 85bpm, remaining fairly constant throughout, and I burned an estimated 157 calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As anyone who has owned a dog might expect, there was a good deal of stopping and starting to inspect particularly interesting trees and bollards, and I defaulted to a fairly casual pace amid a busy work day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Japanese walking protocol, my numbers looked a bit different, with my fast pace falling just below 120 steps per minute and my slow pace a few shy of 100 steps per minute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I travelled significantly further, covering 2.94km and 3,500 steps at an average speed of 10min 12sec per kilometre. My average heart rate came out very similar (86bpm) but there were noticeable peaks (104bpm) and troughs in line with the high- and low-speed intervals. My estimated calorie burn was also significantly higher: 211. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/how-many-steps-a-day-cancer-risk-b2756669.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many steps to take each day to slash your risk of cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/how-many-steps-a-day-cancer-risk-b2756669.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the Japanese walking method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that walking faster, or sprinkling more intensity into your exercise, holds greater benefits is nothing new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialist in walking for health, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://education.ua.edu/about/directory/faculty-directory/elroy-aguiar/"&gt;Dr Elroy Aguiar&lt;/a&gt;, is an assistant professor at the University of Alabama’s department of kinesiology. He was the lead author on a 2024 paper published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sms.14762"&gt;Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports&lt;/a&gt;, which correlated as little as one minute of high-intensity activity with improved health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the really interesting findings from our paper was that, if you look at people’s highest one minute of activity across each day, averaged across the monitoring period, that was a very strong signal for whether they had one or more metabolic syndrome risk factors [elevated waist circumference, high triglycerides, low HDL (or “good” cholesterol), high blood pressure and high blood sugar] present,” he tells me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another series of studies he worked on, featured in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29858465/"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, pointed to the fact that “if you walk at a cadence of about 100 steps per minute, that’s equivalent to what’s called ‘moderate-intensity’, and all of the research in this area suggests that most of the benefits [of walking] accumulate at a moderate or higher intensity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, completing the Japanese walking method four times per week leaves you half-an-hour away from the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity"&gt;World Health Organisation’s&lt;/a&gt; “global recommendations of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week”. Add a couple of short full-body &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; sessions into the mix and you have a decent &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/short-workouts-plan-fitness-dan-john-b2737277.html"&gt;minimalist workout plan&lt;/a&gt; for beginners. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/step-count-walking-benefits-10000-day-b2739534.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How your step count became the ultimate modern humblebrag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/step-count-walking-benefits-10000-day-b2739534.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 eVrEhv"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Completing the ‘Japanese walking’ method a few times each week sets you well on your way to hitting the World Health Organisation’s weekly physical activity guidelines" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-39651"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Completing the ‘Japanese walking’ method a few times each week sets you well on your way to hitting the World Health Organisation’s weekly physical activity guidelines&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Harry Bullmore/The Independent)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential drawbacks of the Japanese Walking method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the information above paints the Japanese walking method in a favourable light – as it should, with the protocol delivering impressive results in a non-intimidating time-span. However, if we are questioning the claim that it is “better” than walking 10,000 steps a day, there are a few further areas to consider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Dr Aguiar’s 2024 paper supported the idea that the “best” walking method for reducing metabolic risk factors involves a combination of high volume (number of steps) and high intensity (walking speed). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Accumulating a high volume of walking throughout the day [8,000-plus steps], then focussing on at least 30 minutes of faster walking or jogging, would be a way to move the metrics in a positive direction and lower your metrics for each of the [metabolic syndrome] risk factors,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I racked up a little over 3,500 steps when trying the Japanese Walking method – less than half of the 8,000 daily steps research has repeatedly linked to many favourable health outcomes, and short of the 5,000 mark often viewed as the threshold for a sedentary lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this method as part, rather than all, of your daily steps could be a better approach for achieving your health goals. However, if you only have 30 minutes per day free, it still offers dramatically more benefits than not moving at all, and improved return on investment over a regular 30-minute walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area where the Japanese walking method loses out to walking 10,000 steps per day is movement regularity. While the former involves a concentrated 30-minute dose of activity, the latter can be spread throughout the day, encouraging you to abandon your office chair and sofa more often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 10-year study of 8,000 people, published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30551177/"&gt;American Journal of Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;, found that those replaced 30 minutes of daily sitting with light activity had a 17 per cent lower risk of dying in that period. This even applied if they accrued these 30 minutes across short intervals throughout the day – hence why your smartwatch is constantly sending you reminders to stand up and move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular movement can also help maintain mobility and reduce stiffness in our joints and muscles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we’re dealing with an adaptation from stillness, movement is the answer, so any movement is better than just being still,” movement mechanics expert and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetrainingstimulus.com/"&gt;The Training Stimulus&lt;/a&gt; founder Ash Grossmann summarises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final factor to consider is enjoyment. By adding a rigid framework, Japanese walking ensures intensity. However, it also meant I was unable to stop and chat to people in the park or appreciate my surroundings to the same extent. For me, this lowered the stress-busting potential of my walk, sacrificing some of the usual mental health benefits of walking for physical ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/news/health/fart-walk-benefits-type-2-diabetes-cancer-b2744886.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the heck is a fart walk?

But if you can fit one or two quick full-body strength training sessions, regular aerobic activity (like walking) and an occasional dash of more intense exercise into each week, it will stand you in very good stead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is among the most accessible forms of exercise there is, lowering the barrier to entry for exercise for billions of people, which is why I’m always keen to promote it. However, in the modern world, even finding time for a quick walk can be tricky for particularly busy individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese walking method provides a time-savvy way to enjoy many of the benefits of a greater volume of daily walking. Sure, you could enjoy higher-intensity exercise in any number of other forms, from cycling to a HIIT workout, but walking remains the most efficient – you don’t even need a change of clothes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So should you try it? Yes, especially if you’re short on time and looking for a way to squeeze health-boosting movement into your day. And should you stick with it? This depends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy this framework, or find it’s something you can stick to with a good degree of regularity, that’s the ticket to a sustainable movement habit and the many health benefits that come from it. If not, look for an alternative form of moderate- to high-intensity exercise that you find fun, and commit to this instead – consistency is the key to long-term results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps day might not matter if you don’t do this one thing, according to an expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 09:24:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPMUpfWG9aODJmbWhMdzFEUjVLNFVGdk9MM3VOejlGSmVjTEFvaWs3eFZCWEdGVDF0dWVJdk5DYjMza0lOUTVzTmN1UExxQjRqbGpLNFItTFdhRmU3ZkdtRXlSWWh4emxqYzNadEtlVFpZVjY1d2pfcXdreE5nZjF6eWE5ZHIwalFEN2ZEMWxFWFF3dXB1SjdfNnRMYUowMWNwaTB2cG1Pdw</guid></item><item><title>医生和护士大喊健康“谎言” ，你应该停止相信，这令人震惊- BuzzFeed | Doctors And Nurses Are Calling Out The Health "Lies" You Should Stop Believing, And It's Shocking - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE1STm5xaEloRjFxOGIxdUE3c2pzcnd3TXNDS0NDX1N6MFhLM1k0RjgtMnlUbnlYWDBtbm8wU2w4NVFDSHRMc3hxU1VBMTBZcHo5X215NkQ3VWNZMTlQaXpmMWx5UFFNUmp0LU56UW1FdGl3SjJYSVhadTcycDhvQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

A big question, and one I am presently pondering from a prone position, naked but for my underpants, which have been lowered on one side to liberate my left bum cheek. Or glute, as the BMI monitors call it, unromantically. I am posed diagonally across an expertly made bed, inert as if poleaxed. Seen from above, I imagine I resemble a crime-scene corpse in a cheap film noir. Is this a case of death by misadventure? An accidental overdose? Or do we suspect foul play? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, I apologise for the unappetising image. At least you don’t have to gaze upon me in real life, like the nurse preparing to administer my antioxidant injection. It has to be the left bum cheek into which she sinks her hypodermic for the simple reason that she jabbed my right bum cheek yesterday. This is the sequel: &lt;em&gt;Bum Cheek – The Final Reckoning&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our scene is playing out in a spotless suite on the fifth floor of a modern building in the picturesque lakeside town of Montreux, Switzerland. Fixtures and fittings are snow-white, like the mountaintops in the distance. There is an air of cleanliness and quiet efficiency that you might accurately describe as clinical. Accurately, since this is a clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I’m not dead. Not yet. In fact, I’m here to find out if I can delay that inevitability for as long as possible without going full blockbuster villain and sinking my teeth into the scenery, so starved am I of my habitual intake of stimulants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="n-content-image n-content-image--full" data-component="image-set"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A7970b4d8-b2ce-4afa-829f-f5d874a25ccd?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A7970b4d8-b2ce-4afa-829f-f5d874a25ccd?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 490px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Aec193b3c-3dfe-468d-aa2f-5f4bace18f81?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=490&amp;amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Aec193b3c-3dfe-468d-aa2f-5f4bace18f81?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=490&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Aec193b3c-3dfe-468d-aa2f-5f4bace18f81?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=490&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Aec193b3c-3dfe-468d-aa2f-5f4bace18f81?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=490&amp;amp;dpr=4 4x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F7970b4d8-b2ce-4afa-829f-f5d874a25ccd.jpg?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1" alt="Alex Bilmes at The Carpenter’s Arms pub on the Hammersmith/Chiswick border, west London" data-image-type="image" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="n-content-picture__caption o3-editorial-typography-caption"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alex Bilmes at The Carpenter’s Arms pub on the Hammersmith/Chiswick border, west London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; © Peter Flude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have reached day five of the Master Detox programme at &lt;a href="https://www.cliniquelaprairie.com/" data-trackable="link"&gt;Clinique La Prairie&lt;/a&gt;, among the world’s leading and longest- established facilities in what we might, with only a slight wince, describe as the longevity “space”. It’s Thursday afternoon. Since Saturday not a sniff of alcohol, not a grain of sugar, not a morsel of meat or animal product (no dairy, no fats), not a molecule of artificial sweeteners or preservatives and no gluten has entered my bloodstream. Instead I have ingested a cornucopia of foaming potions and moussed nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my first day at CLP I was put on a liquid diet. Not the one I’m used to. Strictly juice. Curcuma Healing; Moringa Booster; Antioxidant Flare. These were supplemented by further boosters. And morning and afternoon drops, which I am still obediently adding to my herbal infusions. Each night before bed I was given two “neutracenical” pills to help me sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have chewed and swallowed “edamame chawan mushi with shiitake, ginger, radish and buckwheat”; “Paimpol coco bean fricassee with fine herbs and tomatoes”; and, my favourite, “iced plant salad crystallinum with salicornia and iodin tofu cloud.” All this washed down with CLP’s signature hydrogen water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my third night I was subjected to a “non-invasive internal cleansing of the intestine”. Meaning I drank a large bottle of laxative. It worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also had a “chi nei tsang” massage, in which my internal organs were rearranged by a woman kneading my stomach like dough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been stretched and pummelled. Rubbed and smoothed. Chilled and heated. Peeled and exfoliated. I have had consultations with a doctor, a nutritionist, an aesthetician, a dentist, a trainer and a breathing teacher. I have submitted to a “body composition analysis” and two fitness assessments. I have practised aerial yoga. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have given blood, urine and stool samples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have passed a heavy metal test. (The substance, not a pop trivia quiz, though I fancy I might have aced that too.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first in a series of reports for &lt;em&gt;HTSI&lt;/em&gt; on my misadventures in longevity and – not gonna lie, as my daughter says – I have cheated already. Yesterday afternoon, I made a break for it and went for a jog along the promenade that hugs tight to the curves of Lake Geneva, like leggings to a yogini. I passed a mini-mart. I stopped and bought a vape. (Vuse, strawberry ice.) I puffed away at it for 20 minutes, on a bench by a local landmark: the statue of Freddie Mercury, the rock star who made Montreux his second home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout" data-layout-name="card" data-layout-width="inset-left"&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__container"&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__slot"&gt;&lt;h3 class="n-content-heading-3 o3-editorial-typography-subheading"&gt;Vital stats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age:&lt;/strong&gt; 52&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight:&lt;/strong&gt; 13 stone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Height:&lt;/strong&gt; 6ft (confirmed by professionals)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Units of alcohol drunk per week:&lt;/strong&gt; Too many to mention. Say 50?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cigarettes smoked:&lt;/strong&gt; None, but I vape daily&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise:&lt;/strong&gt; Two Pilates sessions each week. Two x 5K runs – if you can call that running&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health issues:&lt;/strong&gt; High cholesterol for which I take statins. Sciatica&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*correct as of 13 June 2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt none of the illicit thrill I once would have enjoyed at such petty rule-breaking. Instead, I felt like a fraud. Is there a more pathetic sight than a greying dad in gaudy running gear, perspiring heavily while sucking surreptitiously on a noxious plastic dummy? In the rain. Would passers-by not be appalled to know that this man had been flown all the way here for his health, only to fall at the first as soon as he leaves the confines of the clinic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then again, as Freddie Mercury sang, “Who wants to live forever?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another big question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much fun is one willing to forgo in a bid to prolong one’s life? How many pleasures, toxic or otherwise, must we sacrifice in the pursuit of a contented senescence? What’s the ROI on giving up your morning flat white, cutting out your evening glass(es) of Sauvignon Blanc, just saying no &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/22f21d45-ccbb-45f8-9ad9-fab9a113867a" data-trackable="link"&gt;to steak frites&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are frequently told that life is short. Is it, though? I wonder if, without the above, life might feel very long indeed. In spending so much time trying not to die, we might forget to live. It is said that time is the ultimate luxury. For me, the ultimate luxury might be a cold beer on a hot day. Might I not swap six months of advanced decrepitude for that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And from the cheap seats the familiar cry goes up: my grandmother was breaking the filters off her Lambert &amp;amp; Butlers well into her 80s, necking G&amp;amp;Ts and cackling &lt;em&gt;like a pirate&lt;/em&gt;! So was mine. But of my other grandparents, two died in their 50s and the other was seen off by a heart attack in his early 70s. Am I prepared to take that chance? Are you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 class="n-content-heading-3 o3-editorial-typography-subheading"&gt;The HTSI longevity quiz: take our test to find out how to maximise your health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout" data-layout-name="auto" data-layout-width="full-grid"&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__container"&gt;&lt;custom-code-component path="ft-interactive/ccc-htsi-quiz/Component" version="0.0.24" label="Question 10 Results text 1" question_1="How frequently do you struggle to fall asleep or stay asleep throughout the night?" question_10="On average, how many servings of fruits and vegetables do you eat per day?" question_10_answer_1="Less than one" question_10_answer_2="One to two" question_10_answer_3="Three to four" question_10_answer_4="More than five" question_10_category_text="Nutrition" question_10_results_text_1="Invest in a blender. “Make creamy sauces that you can blend beans into,” says Dr Emily Leeming, a dietitian and scientist at King’s College London. “If you're making mashed potato, keep the skin on and add in some Queen Butter beans.” Or try a frozen berry smoothie. They’re “high in fibre and packed with polyphenols, which are important for brain health.”" question_10_results_text_2="Seek out easy, hydrating vegetables. “A cucumber is 95 per cent water – they're hydrating, have a natural cooling effect and are rich in antioxidants and loads of nutrients,” says nutritionist Kat Chan. “Often you’ll see a pack of bell peppers that have a green, yellow and a red in one – that’s three types of hydration. Plus they’re super-rich in Vitamin C, which is fantastic for your immune system.” " question_10_results_text_3="“We would all benefit from having five to six portions of fruit and veg a day,” says nutritionist Kat Chan, but “if you’re only thinking about that as boiled broccoli and carrots, it's going to be impossible.” Ask yourself, “can I put something in my scrambled eggs? Can I blend six different things into my soup? Can I drink it? There are lots of different ways in. A portion can be a measuring cup.”" question_10_results_text_4="Go the extra mile and experiment with toppings. “Sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, chia and flax seeds,” says nutritionist Kat Chan. “Mix them together in a jar and sprinkle them on anything – omelettes, yoghurt, salads. Fermented foods – pickles, kimchi, sauerkraut – are also great toppings, and are rich in bacteria that supports our gut microbiome. Mix miso into your scrambled eggs or salad dressings.”" question_12="Results" question_12_answer_1="Congratulations! You are doing well to try to live an active, healthy life. But can you make further improvements? “Go the extra mile and experiment with toppings such as sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, chia and flaxseeds,” says nutritionist Kat Chan. “Fermented foods are also great toppings and are rich in bacteria that supports our gut microbiome.” Exercise is good but make sure you don’t overdo it. Overtraining is detrimental for progress: “make sure you’re having rest days,” says personal trainer Lavina Mehta. “Your muscles need time to rest, recover and rebuild.” And be careful to stay hydrated, adds Kristian Phillips, co-founder and CEO of wellbeing platform Cloudfit. " question_12_answer_2="You seem to have a good grasp of your overall health and are making positive decisions. But is there room for improvement? There is compelling evidence to suggest that alcohol in any amount can be detrimental to your long-term health. If you do drink, “only drink with meals (those who drink on an empty stomach are more likely to develop health problems) and drink slowly to allow your body to metabolise it”, says Dr Brian P Lee, hepatologist and liver transplant specialist with Keck Medicine of USC. “And stick to wine and beer: liquor has been associated with more health problems.”" question_12_answer_3='Your health could do with improvement. “Focus on what is under your control,” says Professor Sarah Berry, a nutritional scientist at King’s College London and chief scientist at nutrition app Zoe, who points to a clinical trial that found that replacing “typical snacks” with almonds gave participants an “improvement in blood vessel function equivalent to a 30 per cent reduction in cardiovascular disease risk". Likewise with exercise: “Aim to move every 30 minutes,” says personal trainer Lavina Mehta. “Two hours of sitting will negate 20 minutes of exercise. Try hopping: 50 hops a day are great for supporting bone density, especially in women, who are more susceptible to osteoporosis and hip fractures.” ' question_12_answer_4="Uh-oh, you need to focus on some personal care. But rather than being overwhelmed, focus on making small changes first. “People get attached to the idea that they have to make radical changes,” says lifestyle transformation coach Fran Burns. “But actually it’s asking ourselves, what is the smallest micro-dose of action that I can take towards what I want? Can you put some leafy greens with every meal? Can you go to bed half an hour earlier tonight?” Likewise, when it comes to exercise, don’t try to run a marathon. Aim for “three flights of stairs three times a day”, says personal trainer Lavina Mehta. “It’s been proven to boost your overall fitness and cardiovascular health.” " question_12_category_text="results" question_1_answer_1="I never have problems" question_1_answer_2="A few times per month" question_1_answer_3="Once or twice per week" question_1_answer_4="Three times or more per week" question_1_category_text="Sleep" question_1_results_text_1="Dr Guy Meadows, a sleep physiologist and co-founder of Sleep School, says you should still aim to get your biological sleep needs. “For the majority of us that’s seven to eight hours, but the range is six to nine hours,” he says. Stick to a routine: “the simple act of going to bed and getting up at the same time every day has a knock-on effect on every other biological process.”" question_1_results_text_2="Are you waking up with racing thoughts? “We become catastrophic at night because the part of the brain that covers reasoning and problem solving is asleep,” says Dr Jason Ellis, a professor in psychology at Northumbria University. “Count backwards from 1,000 in sevens – it sounds horrendous, but I guarantee you can't think about your mortgage at the same time.”" question_1_results_text_3="“Put the day to bed before you go to bed,” says Dr Jason Ellis, a professor in psychology at Northumbria University. “I give myself half an hour to think about concerns, and give them a traffic-light system: red for nothing I can do, yellow for something I can do but not tonight, green for something I can do now. Green, I'll do it. Red and yellow I put on my to-do list.&amp;quot;" question_1_results_text_4="“Set a sleep alarm”, where you consciously start preparing yourself for bed, says Dr Guy Meadows, a sleep physiologist and co-founder of Sleep School. “At the end of the day, your willpower is on the floor”, making “one more episode” of television harder to say no to. “Make it easy. Turn off your WiFi. Turn off your phone.” " question_2="How often do you feel overwhelmed by your daily responsibilities (family, job, finances)?" question_2_answer_1="Rarely" question_2_answer_2="Sometimes" question_2_answer_3="Often" question_2_answer_4="Always" question_2_category_text="Stress" question_2_results_text_1="If you drink coffee, regulate your intake. “Wait an hour after you wake to drink it,” says lifestyle transformation coach Fran Burns. “When we wake up, our cortisol levels fly up; allow that morning spike to happen before you put caffeine into your body. Even better, have a massive glass of water first.” " question_2_results_text_2="Food can reduce anxiety. Life coach Annie Fontaine suggests stabilising blood sugar levels with “protein, fibre and healthy fats – prioritise magnesium-rich leafy greens, pumpkin seeds [and] avocados; omega-3s (fatty fish, flaxseeds, walnuts) and B vitamins (eggs, legumes, leafy greens).” " question_2_results_text_3="Transformational coach Fran Burns advises “taking five minutes every single day to really be with yourself, whether that involves walking around your block or sitting in your car – whatever it takes to create an environment where you're not going to be interrupted. It allows your nervous system to calm down, for you to better understand what your next step is.”" question_2_results_text_4="“Stress is both situational and hardwired,” says anxiety life coach Annie Fontaine. You can change this. Try “daily breathwork” (breathing in for four seconds, holding the breath for seven seconds, and exhaling for eight seconds), alternating between hot and cold water during a shower “to train stress resilience” and CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) to “reframe triggers”. " question_3="How often do you worry about your overall wellbeing?" question_3_answer_1="Never" question_3_answer_2="Every month" question_3_answer_3="Every week" question_3_answer_4="Every day" question_3_answer_5="Constantly" question_3_category_text="Mindset" question_3_results_text_1="Keep doing what you’re doing, but listen to your body and make note of any changes. If you experience a “rapid and persistent change in sleep, that's a good indication that something is going to be happening with [your] physical, psychological or economic health”, says Dr Jason Ellis, a professor in psychology at Northumbria University." question_3_results_text_2="“People get attached to the idea that they have to make radical changes,” says transformational coach Fran Burns. “But actually it’s asking ourselves, what is the smallest micro-dose of action that I can take towards what I want? Can you put some leafy greens with every meal? Can you go to bed half an hour earlier tonight? Think of it more like an evolution than a revolution.”" question_3_results_text_3="If you fall off track, get back on it. “We have this imaginary scenario where we’ve done something we feel is ‘bad’ for us and we’re like, screw it,” says nutritionist Kat Chan. “The body is perfectly designed – it’s just that we go through phases where things might be more difficult and we don’t make the best choices.” " question_3_results_text_4="You might be overthinking things. “One bad night does not give you insomnia,” says Dr Jason Ellis, a professor in psychology at Northumbria University. Similarly, “one bad meal is not going to ruin an overall healthy dietary pattern”, says Professor Sarah Berry, a nutritional scientist at King’s College London and chief scientist at nutrition app Zoe.

" question_4_results_text_2="“A lot can be done in an hour,” says Kristian Phillips, co-founder and CEO of fitness app Cloudfit. “Prioritise compound movements (squats, push-ups, deadlifts, rows) – exercises that work multiple muscle movements.” Don’t have an hour? Sprinkling exercise – squats, hops and star jumps – throughout the day is “just as effective, if not more effective, as a long workout”, says personal trainer Lavina Mehta.  " question_4_results_text_3="“Aim for a variety of training methods,” says Kristian Phillips, co-founder and CEO of wellbeing platform Cloudfit. “Resistance training helps to build muscle and longevity. Cardiovascular work – walking, running, cycling, rowing – supports your heart health. And restorative exercise – yoga, Pilates – supports your nervous system and your joints.” " question_4_results_text_4="“If you are putting the work in, replenish those muscles with protein-rich meals,” says Kristian Phillips, co-founder and CEO of wellbeing platform Cloudfit. “Stay hydrated: I’ve got a 1.5l bottle of water I’ll go through once or twice a day.” But overtraining is detrimental for progress. “Make sure you’re having rest days – you will get better results,” says personal trainer Lavina Mehta. “Your muscles need time to rest, recover and rebuild.” " question_5="On a typical day, how many hours do you spend sitting or sedentary (at a desk, watching TV, driving)?" question_5_answer_1="Less than four" question_5_answer_2="Four to six" question_5_answer_3="Six to eight" question_5_category_text="Exercise" question_5_results_text_1="“Two hours of sitting will negate 20 minutes of exercise,” says personal trainer Lavina Mehta. You should still aim to move every 30 minutes. “If you’re already active, you might just do a stretch to ease out some tension – some simple chest openers or a neck stretch.” " question_5_results_text_2="Try “exercise snacking”, says personal trainer Lavina Mehta. That could be “as simple as doing 10 squats every 45 minutes or throwing in some press-ups against the wall when you’re making your coffee. Or try hopping: 50 hops a day are great for helping people to improve bone density, especially women, who are more susceptible to osteoporosis and hip fractures.”" question_5_results_text_3="“People in the habit of sitting idle tend to have a higher risk of weight gain, Type 2 diabetes and heart disease,” says personal trainer Peter Cobby, adding: “Get off the bus two stops earlier to get some steps in.” If you’re stuck at your desk, “throw in some heel raises – the soleus muscle is really good for absorbing excess blood sugar”, suggests fellow PT Lavina Mehta. “Balance on one leg while you’re brushing your teeth.”" question_6="How many times a week do you eat a healthy and nutritious meal?" question_6_answer_1="Every meal" question_6_answer_2="Almost every meal" question_6_answer_3="Once a day" question_6_answer_4="Two or three days" question_6_answer_5="Four or five days" question_6_answer_6="Hardly ever" question_6_category_text="Nutrition" question_6_results_text_1="There still might be room for improvement. “Think about how you eat,” says Professor Sarah Berry, a nutritional scientist at King’s College London and chief scientist at nutrition app Zoe. “If you’re a fast eater, you tend to have higher adiposity [an increased amount of body fat]. Research shows if you slow down – just by 20 per cent – you reduce your energy intake by up to 15 per cent.” If you consume 2,000 calories per day, that’s a 300-calorie reduction." question_6_results_text_2="Focus on what you can control, says Professor Sarah Berry, a nutritional scientist at King’s College London and chief scientist at nutrition app Zoe, who points to a clinical study that found that replacing “typical snacks” (chocolate and crisps) with almonds gave participants an “improvement in blood vessel function equivalent to a 30 per cent reduction in cardiovascular disease risk”." question_6_results_text_3="“Seek flavour rather than specific veg,” says nutritionist Kat Chan. “Nature is clever – if it tastes quite strong as it comes out of the soil, it is probably rich in something good for us. Bitter foods – grapefruits, cacao, rocket – are really rich in phytonutrients and help simulate certain hormones that help us feel fuller, digest better and break down proteins.” " question_6_results_text_4="“The minimum thing you can do is finish your food two hours before you go to bed,” says transformational coach Fran Burns. “Our digestive system uses energy, so if it’s doing that while you’re asleep, it’s not doing the stuff we need, such as getting rid of cells that aren’t functioning anymore.”" question_6_results_text_5="“If I was to suggest one nutrient to increase, it would be fibre: beans, pulses, legumes,” says Professor Sarah Berry, a nutritional scientist at King's College London and chief scientist at nutrition app Zoe. “Ninety six per cent of people in the UK don’t get enough. Start with baked beans and work your way up. You may reduce your blood pressure, improve your mental health, increase your energy levels and reduce in the long term your risk of chronic diseases.”" question_6_results_text_6="“Embrace a whole foods philosophy, meaning lean proteins, whole grains, fruits and vegetables,” says Dr Marci Laudenslager, an assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “The best nutrition approach is one that is sustainable”. Combine this with “strength training and some daily movement – the more muscle mass you have, the more calories you burn at rest,” says Kristian Phillips, co-founder and CEO of fitness app Cloudfit." question_7="What is the primary source of protein in your diet?" question_7_answer_1="A mix of animal and plant sources" question_7_answer_2="Mostly plant-based: tofu, nuts, legumes" question_7_answer_3="Mostly animal sources: meat, dairy, eggs" question_7_category_text="Nutrition" question_7_results_text_1="“A mix of all proteins is probably best,” says nutritionist Kat Chan. “Certain meats have B12 – beneficial for brain health – but tofu, tempeh and fresh fish all bring their own unique set of nutrients to the table. Ball your hand up into a fist: that is a good visual cue of how much protein you want to be eating at meals.” And that doesn’t have to be one type per meal – “some chopped tofu with a couple of eggs scrambled together would make a good amount”." question_7_results_text_2="You can get what you need “as long as you’re mixing the three main plant-based sources of protein, whole grains, legumes and nuts and seeds”, says Professor Sarah Berry, a nutritional scientist at King’s College London and chief scientist at nutrition app Zoe. “There is some evidence to show that plant-based sources might not be absorbed quite as well as meat. I would typically suggest getting about one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight. If you’re vegan or vegetarian, you might want to consider getting 1.1g or 1.2g per kilogram.”" question_7_results_text_3="“Make the right choices,” says Professor Sarah Berry, a nutritional scientist at King’s College London and chief scientist at nutrition app Zoe. “A low-fat Greek yoghurt is a great source of protein without the saturated fat.

Even very low [amounts of] alcohol are associated with lower life expectancy.”" question_8_results_text_2="Avoid alcohol when you need rest and mental clarity most. “It’s a toxin, so your body has to get rid of it quite quickly,” says Dr Jason Ellis, a professor in psychology at Northumbria University. That means heating up the body to sweat it out, leading to fragmented sleep. “We wake up feeling sleep-deprived, dehydrated and miserable because REM [rapid eye movement] sleep is about emotional regulation.” " question_8_results_text_3="“Seventy per cent of the population drink alcohol – we have to think about what’s palatable,” says Dr Brian P Lee, hepatologist and liver transplant specialist with Keck Medicine of USC. “Only drink with meals (those who drink on an empty stomach are more likely to develop health problems) and drink slowly to allow your body to metabolise it appropriately.” Lastly, he says: “stick to wine and beer: liquor has been associated with more health problems.”" question_8_results_text_4="This isn’t just a strain on your liver – alcohol is connected to seven types of cancer. “Your risk of oral cancer, for example, goes up by five-fold if you drink 70 units a week,” says Professor Kevin Moore, principal clinical research fellow at University College London. “For moderate drinkers – 20-30 units a week – the impact on your life expectancy is about four years. If you’re in your 20s, that’s nothing.

It just makes the load on the body a little bit lighter.”" question_9_results_text_3="“No cuisine is healthier than another – diversity is the thing,” says nutritionist Kat Chan. “If you can count the number of fun, zingy, crunchy, sour, spicy toppings, it's probably quite good for you.

As with all wellness-industry innovations, the term is vulnerable to abuse by woo-woo pseudo-scientists, amateur biohackers and snake oil salespeople promising instant immortality for a modest monthly subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief – and to be fair, the term is misleading in this context – longevity is not necessarily about making you live longer. Or it’s not &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; about making you live longer. It’s about helping you live healthier, so that if you do live longer, you will also live better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Clinique La Prairie they base their pursuit of longevity on four pillars: Medical Care, Nutrition, Movement and Wellbeing. Over the coming months, I’m going to have a go at changing my approach to all of those – without completely forswearing all pleasure. On a hot day, I’ll have a cold beer. And then at the end we’ll see if it’s made any difference to my odds of long-term survival. Or, rather, to my odds of slowing the ageing process, so that I can remain vital in my declining years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout" data-layout-width="full-grid"&gt;&lt;figure class="n-content-picture n-content-picture--wide n-content-layout__container" data-component="image-set"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 490px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A18bf493f-e4b4-4c4d-ab57-2b0b181b148d?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=490&amp;amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A18bf493f-e4b4-4c4d-ab57-2b0b181b148d?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=490&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A18bf493f-e4b4-4c4d-ab57-2b0b181b148d?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=490&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A18bf493f-e4b4-4c4d-ab57-2b0b181b148d?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=490&amp;amp;dpr=4 4x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 980px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Aed790f36-53a1-42e8-afcb-902a406eba02?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=1200&amp;amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Aed790f36-53a1-42e8-afcb-902a406eba02?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=1200&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F9b6df957-f954-4f18-85e3-eea680ac98b3.jpg?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1" alt="" data-image-type="image" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="n-content-picture__caption o3-editorial-typography-caption"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;© Peter Flude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that I should be the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;’s longevity lab rat was not mine. Like an anti-ageing elixir poured into a chipped mug, the notion was decanted directly from the brain of the editor of &lt;em&gt;HTSI&lt;/em&gt; over a recent lunch. An act of charity, and an act of mischief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charity because after 14 years as a glossy magazine honcho myself, I recently hung up my editing boots – bespoke, cashmere-lined – and I think she was concerned I needed a project to keep me out of the pub. Mischief because I have not by any stretch lived a life of delayed gratification. Self-denial is as alien to me as Yoda. I am the best person to do this because I am the worst person to do this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t think you need to know every detail I shared with the medics at Clinique La Prairie as they assessed my current health and fitness. But step four of the 12 taken by the acknowledged addict requires those in recovery to “make a searching and fearless” personal inventory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here goes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="o3-editorial-typography-list-unordered"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, very much so. At least a couple of glasses of wine every day, and sometimes more than a couple. I am not an alcoholic. But based on my week on the wagon in Switzerland, I accept that I am “alcohol-dependent”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drugs&lt;/strong&gt; Shall we say that in my younger days, like the great American musician John Prine, I sometimes wore an illegal smile? (“It don’t cost very much, but it lasts a long while.”) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoking&lt;/strong&gt; I am addicted to nicotine and have been since I was 15. I stubbed out the cigs for good a couple of years ago and replaced them with vapes. Better, but still colossally stupid. And not a great look for a man of my seniority (I’m 52).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine&lt;/strong&gt; I am addicted to coffee. I had a headache for the duration of my time in Montreux – the consequence, I was assured, of abruptly cutting off my espresso supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diet&lt;/strong&gt; A disaster. I eat red meat in some form every other day, on average. I could murder a burger &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;. I love fried food. My last meal before I left for Switzerland was at J Sheekey, in Covent Garden: fish and chips. I am addicted to sugar. My love of snacking is so well advertised that, when I left my magazine job in March, among my presents was a biscuit tin. I eat too much processed food: too many crisps, too much chocolate, not enough fruit and vegetables. I don’t drink enough water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitness&lt;/strong&gt; Unless you count freaky dancing – I do, but medical science is slow to catch up with the chemical generation – I did no exercise of any kind until I turned 40. At which point, motivated by vanity alone, I began to work out with a trainer, and to run a couple of times each week. I also – temporarily, it turned out – gave up smoking and cut down on carbs. That all hit a wall in 2022, when I slipped a disc in my back. Surgery fixed it but left me with bouts of sciatica that I treat twice weekly with Pilates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medication&lt;/strong&gt; I take statins for cholesterol, as well as additional medication (Ezetimibe, Inclisiran) because my fatty lipids are the result of genetic rather than &lt;em&gt;lifestyle factors&lt;/em&gt;. (Lifestyle factors: ain’t that your favourite euphemism?) I take a daily aspirin to thin the blood. All pretty standard stuff, I think, for a man of my age, background and inclinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my first day in Switzerland I underwent a biologic and metabolic assessment. This measures glycans (the level of chronic inflammation and immune health), ceramides (a marker for cardiovascular health), genetic predispositions, and DNA microbiota (the bacteria in the gut). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results, which I awaited with trepidation bordering on blind panic, were encouraging. I’ve hardly lived the life of Keith Richards – I’m a spoilt journalist, not a buccaneering rock star – but given my capacity for indulgence, I’m in pretty good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the medication, my LDL stats are still sub-optimal. The prescription: more exercise, to “increase high-density lipoprotein”. My sodium level could use some attention: less salt, more water. My uric acid score is a little high: charcuterie is off the menu. The doctor, a twinkly man with salt and pepper stubble, suggested I consider a vitamin D supplement. And he pretty much forbade me to even look at a croissant for as long as I live. (Duration TBC.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On to the physical exams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My “physique rating”, measuring “visceral fat” and muscle mass, pronounced me “healthy”. All metrics were at “acceptable” or “average” levels. In fact, I have the “body composition” of a man of 45, seven years my junior. Get in! Maybe a pint and a packet of pork scratchings to toast my continued good health? Maybe not, says the doc. An average man of 45 still has much to do to stay fit. And, anyway, who wants to be average? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I’m in decent condition but not in great shape. I have a modest paunch and what my erstwhile colleague Will Self once described – in print, if you please – as “incipient jowls”. That was a few years back; I accept they may now be more fully realised. The CLP aesthetician picked up on this: apparently, I’m a good candidate for a Focused Ultrasound treatment on my jawline, such as it is, and I could use some Coolsculpting on my abdomen. Charming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="n-content-image n-content-image--full" data-component="image-set"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A40571ff5-a2e0-4d59-974e-4c277558ef87?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A40571ff5-a2e0-4d59-974e-4c277558ef87?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A40571ff5-a2e0-4d59-974e-4c277558ef87?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A40571ff5-a2e0-4d59-974e-4c277558ef87?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=4 4x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 490px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A1b18ab27-976b-4dab-9fe0-dc356e8cd597?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=490&amp;amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A1b18ab27-976b-4dab-9fe0-dc356e8cd597?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=490&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A1b18ab27-976b-4dab-9fe0-dc356e8cd597?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=490&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A1b18ab27-976b-4dab-9fe0-dc356e8cd597?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=490&amp;amp;dpr=4 4x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F40571ff5-a2e0-4d59-974e-4c277558ef87.jpg?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1" alt="" data-image-type="image" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="n-content-picture__caption o3-editorial-typography-caption"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;© Peter Flude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think I’ll swerve the beauty treatments and stick to the four pillars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I have mentioned to friends that I’m working on this story, at least half of them – an unscientific sample, granted – have referred to the megarich super-crank Bryan Johnson, subject of the grimly compelling Netflix documentary &lt;em&gt;Don’t Die: The Man Who Wants to Live Forever&lt;/em&gt;. Am I, like Johnson, they wonder, going to attempt to “neutralise ageing” by waking at 4.30am to work out, swallowing more than 100 pills daily and exchanging my tired old blood for the “young plasma” of my son?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, I’m not. I don’t have the time, the money, or the desire. And Oscar Bilmes (aged 12) doesn’t like needles; I asked, he demurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson is trying to cheat death. It sometimes seems that, like Liam Gallagher (in this only), he wants to live forever. That’s his business. It’s literally his business: he is a wellness entrepreneur and investor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no guarantee I’ll live longer as a result of following CLP’s advice. It’s impossible to know how long I’d live if I carry on as I have been, and even if I were to switch to Johnsonian levels of self-control (and self-absorption), we can’t know exactly what effect that would have. I might be run over by an autonomous taxi – and so might Bryan Johnson – before this story even makes it into print. Which would be inconvenient although, as I pointed out to the &lt;em&gt;HTSI &lt;/em&gt;editors, it would make for an eye-catching headline: “Longevity Columnist Dead at 52: Witnesses Confirm He Didn’t See it Coming.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over lunch in Montreux, Simone Gibertoni, the CEO of Clinique La Prairie, assured me that his clinic could not and would not guarantee long life for its clients – that’s beyond even the dapper Gibertoni. What they do is identify risk factors and areas for improvement. Each patient is given a specific programme, tailor-made for them, based on factors both genetic and epigenetic. (Genetic is the hand that fate deals you; epigenetic is how you play that hand.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re not paying £18,000-plus just to be told to put down your sausage sandwich and get back on the treadmill. Gibertoni stressed the fact that a week in Montreux was not a cure-all. Some visitors have serious long-term health issues – it’s a hospital, after all – while others are here for spoiling spa treatments in a picturesque setting. Some come – he was looking at me here, but in a kindly way – for an annual purge and imagine they can return to their sybaritic lifestyles safe in the knowledge that they’ve done their bit for better health. That’s not how it works. (Damn.)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you live long enough,” said another Simone (de Beauvoir), “you’ll see that every victory turns into a defeat.” I don’t know it that’s correct. I haven’t lived long enough yet to find out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eat grass, walk around,” says the twinkly medic at our final consultation. Sounds easy. But if you’ve spent close to 40 years, as I have, indolently filling your gob with Monster Munch, Marlboro Lights and cheap European lager, contemplating a future of kale, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/379a464a-2f00-417f-acc1-e0a2bed77b69" data-trackable="link"&gt;kombucha&lt;/a&gt; and vigorous exercise is sobering – literally sobering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like an antioxidant shot, personal transformation is a pain in the bum. But, as with growing old, it’s probably better than the alternative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How healthy is your lifestyle? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://ft.com/editor/5a74e48f-7450-44a5-8f79-6fedfd06664a" data-trackable="link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take our quiz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and join Alex Bilmes on his quest at the Longevity Project at ft.com/the longevityproject&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Financial Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 08:30:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5PRGZoM0JqN1Bld1JvdVo1NUY3MFhUd3hWUmpPNkRLN3ViV2FnaXlZdERYRzliWXBPZjAyZU9QelRLQ0Q2bDhuZ3NyMldNWU0xdHhhQmF1bERKeFhHb3d6Mk8tN2pRLU84bC1aVnJGU2o</guid></item><item><title>当医生解释发生了什么时， Ozempic的使用正在引起令人担忧的卧室副作用- LADbible | Ozempic use is causing worrying bedroom side effect as doctor explains what is going on - LADbible</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxPTFBYRHRONktlSFNIVHNsT3pqOGMyaUdncEUtTlRDVTR1alV5dUtNWms0bjhtbk1pM1hGd0NnQk16Y0tVMmEwWVlFUDZmbUhEeGctYzYwc29XTlU2VmVFV2Z0cE5GZTQzekFuekp0cWhzTnlOdGZ5dV9sbkhpUVBjQ2RtMHRBNDlFV2FEaHlOblBvZWFrZEwxY1E3TUgyVmZNQlE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;An Ozempic user has revealed one unexpected side effect that's 'causing issues in their relationship'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;While many people are having a lot of success taking GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic, Mounjaro and Wegovy, the drugs have a wide range of potential &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/ozempic-mounjaro-wegovy-five-major-side-effects-654406-20250604"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Ozempic in particular - which is designed to treat type 2 diabetes and has not been approved in the UK for weight loss - led &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/jeremy-clarkson"&gt;Jeremy Clarkson&lt;/a&gt; to have some pretty horrible sickness, while others have noticed changes in their &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/ozempic-wegovy-mounjaro-osteoporosis-weight-loss-doctor-health-451597-20250603"&gt;muscle strength&lt;/a&gt;, face structure and even in their downstairs area after being on the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Although you might expect that an improvement in cardiovascular health and body weight might well lead to more success in the bedroom, some users on &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/reddit"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; are now suggesting that their sex drive is 'completely gone' after taking the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/drugs"&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;GLP-1 medications are on the rise (Getty Stock)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The original poster &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1ia1zjj/absolutely_no_sex_drive_on_ozempic/?force_seo=1"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;: "I've been on Ozempic for a few months now and I love it.

I'm on 1.5mg compounded with Vitamin B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The only side effect I have noticed that's causing issues in my life is that I have absolutely no sex drive at all, and I'm almost repulsed by the notion of it. I have more or less the same feelings that I have when presented with a big meal. Like the thought of having sex is almost nauseating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"If I was single this really wouldn't impact my life very much, but I live with my boyfriend of about 2.5 years, and the sharp decrease in our sex life is causing issues in our relationship.

Losing track of names, misplacing keys, or asking the same question over and over again. But dementia is far more than just a memory problem. In fact, for many people, the first red flags don’t show up as memory loss at all. They show up in behavior, mood, and personality—and those signs are often dismissed as “stress,” “burnout,” or simply aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s where it gets dangerous. Because when dementia hides in plain sight, it delays diagnosis and treatment. And that means families miss the crucial early window when support, medication, and lifestyle changes might make a meaningful difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about the lesser-known, often misunderstood side of dementia—the one that doesn't involve forgetting, but transforming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Have you or someone you know experienced mood swings that seemed out of character?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The personality shift no one talks about&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine this: a once-gentle man starts lashing out at his spouse over small things. A soft-spoken grandmother becomes unusually blunt, even cruel, during conversations. Or a dependable coworker begins showing up late, snapping at colleagues, and refusing to take feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When these changes happen, the first instinct is rarely “this could be dementia.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, we blame stress, retirement blues, midlife crisis, depression, or even relationship trouble. But what’s actually happening may be damage to the brain’s frontal lobes—regions that control emotional regulation, social behavior, and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frontal lobe damage is common in certain types of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/frontotemporal-disorders/what-are-frontotemporal-disorders-causes-symptoms-and-treatment" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, especially frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It often affects people under 65 and starts with changes in personality and social conduct long before memory starts slipping. Sadly, this kind of behavior often leads to strained relationships, judgment from others, and even job loss—before anyone realizes there’s a neurological explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Paranoia, suspicion, and mistrust&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be heartbreaking to watch a loved one gradually stop trusting the people closest to them. But that’s exactly what can happen when dementia affects the brain’s ability to process information accurately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone in early-stage dementia might accuse family members of stealing, think a spouse is cheating, or believe strangers are plotting against them. It’s not malice—it’s confusion, amplified by the brain’s inability to piece together logical cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These paranoid thoughts often emerge in conditions like Lewy body &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/lewy-body-dementia/lewy-body-dementia-causes-symptoms-and-diagnosis" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;dementia &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;or Alzheimer’s, especially in the later stages. But even in the early phase, subtle suspicion and mistrust may surface—causing painful misunderstandings between the patient and their caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Apathy that looks like laziness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the quietest, most overlooked signs of dementia is apathy. We're not talking about fatigue after a long week. We're talking about a total disinterest in things that once brought joy. A lifelong reader who stops picking up books. A gardening enthusiast who no longer touches their plants. A grandparent who avoids talking to their grandchildren, not because they don't care, but because the motivation simply isn’t there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lack of initiative isn’t laziness or depression—it’s neurological. As dementia progresses, especially in the frontal lobes, the drive to initiate activities can disappear. And since apathy doesn’t raise immediate red flags like memory loss does, it’s easy for families to miss the early warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mood swings without warning&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another early behavioral shift that can point toward dementia is extreme mood changes. One moment, someone may be calm and composed; the next, they’re overwhelmed with anger, sadness, or irritability over something minor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This emotional instability isn’t always related to an event—it often comes from how the brain is processing (or failing to process) information. As cognitive function declines, so does the ability to regulate emotion. Something as simple as a schedule change or a noise in the background can trigger outbursts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In families, this can be exhausting. It may feel like walking on eggshells. But recognizing that these mood swings are not a character flaw—but a medical issue—can help caregivers respond with more compassion and less frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Loss of empathy&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more surprising and unsettling behavioral changes in dementia—especially frontotemporal dementia—is the loss of empathy. Loved ones may notice the person no longer seems to care about others’ feelings, or doesn’t respond appropriately to emotional situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can look like someone laughing at a funeral, not comforting a crying spouse, or showing no concern when someone gets hurt. For families, this can be deeply painful—particularly if the person was once known for being thoughtful and caring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But again, this isn’t the real person being cold-hearted. It’s a symptom of neurological damage. The brain regions responsible for empathy and social awareness are often among the first to go in FTD, making emotional disconnect one of the earliest signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Repetitive or compulsive behaviors&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While memory issues may take time to emerge, certain repetitive behaviors can start showing up early in the dementia timeline. This might look like someone checking the same door lock 10 times in a row, hoarding random objects, or developing a fixation with routines and rituals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes these behaviors are harmless. Other times, they interfere with daily life or create distress when interrupted. In many cases, they’re a way for the brain to cope with confusion and fading control. It’s a grasp at stability in a world that no longer feels predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These kinds of obsessive or compulsive habits are especially common in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, and they often accompany the other personality changes already mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why these signs are so easy to miss&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the hard truth: behavioral signs of dementia don’t look “medical” at first. They look emotional. They feel personal. They stir up guilt, anger, and frustration—not clinical concern. And because many of them overlap with mental health conditions like depression or anxiety, misdiagnosis is common, especially in younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, people with dementia often lack insight into their own condition. They don’t realize their behavior has changed. That means it often falls on spouses, children, or friends to notice the shift—and to raise the alarm, even when it’s uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why early detection still matters&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though dementia can’t be cured, early diagnosis opens doors. It gives families time to plan, organize care, and explore treatments that may slow progression. It also allows patients to make choices while they still can—about finances, healthcare, and personal wishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when the diagnosis comes early, families are more likely to show empathy rather than resentment. They’re able to separate the disease from the person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What you can do if you notice these signs&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve noticed uncharacteristic behavior in someone you love—especially if it’s paired with forgetfulness, confusion, or withdrawal—it’s worth bringing it up gently. Talk to a doctor. Ask for a cognitive screening. You don’t need a crisis to start looking for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because sometimes, dementia doesn’t look like forgetting names or getting lost. Sometimes, it looks like anger. Or coldness. Or isolation. And seeing that for what it is—an illness, not a personality—could change everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt; This article is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

              &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Every year, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-your-seasonal-allergies-seem-way-worse-right-now-1851395471"&gt;&lt;span&gt;pollen seasons grow longer and more intense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—to the great misery of those suffering from pollen allergies—myself included. There’s only so much one can do with antihistamines or hot towels, and no amount of protective measures—masks, firmly shut windows, you name it—appears to offer any protection from the endless sneezing, runny noses, and itchy eyes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But what if, by spraying something akin to a nasal spray, you could thwart the onslaught of those pesky allergens before they latch onto your sensitive nasal passages? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This was the “simple but powerful idea” that inspired &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kaznaru.edu.kz/en/sciences/agrotechnical-hubs/3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kaissar Tabynov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, who led the efforts to create a “molecular shield” that intercepts allergens the moment they approach our airways. For the experiment, they targeted mugwort pollen, which is the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6267181/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;most common cause of pollen allergy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in Central Asia and Europe. Tabynov and colleagues reported the first proof-of-principle for this technology, in this instance with mice, in a paper published today in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1595659/full"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Frontiers in Immunology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Allergies are often viewed as inconvenient but minor conditions, yet for millions, they severely reduce quality of life and can even be life-threatening,” Tabynov, director of the International Center for Vaccinology at Kazakh National Agrarian Research University in Kazakhstan, told Gizmodo in an email. “We believe this could be the beginning of a new class of anti-allergy interventions—smart, fast, and easy to use—that could protect people during allergy season in a way no existing therapy does.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here’s how the “shield” works. Researchers first develop a monoclonal antibody, or a lab-made protein designed to attach to a specific molecule. In this case it’s aimed at a major allergy-causing protein found in mugwort pollen. These antibodies are applied to the nose, effectively snatching the allergens away from our natural antibodies, which trigger allergic responses when bound with allergens. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The immune system is an intricate network of cells and hormones, so adjusting the treatment such that it wouldn’t disrupt the natural system of mice proved to be a major challenge, explained Tabynov. Not only that, mugwort pollen is actually a combination of multiple allergy-causing particles (partly the reason they’re so insufferable), meaning Tabynov’s team had to focus on the most clinically relevant parts of the allergen complex. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After several adjustments, the team succeeded in making an antibody treatment that curbed nasal inflammation and asthma symptoms in mice, and it did so without harming the animals’ natural antibodies. Although the duration of the treatment was shorter than Tabynov hoped, he told Gizmodo that he and his team have already devised a strategy to potentially make the treatment last longer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“What’s exciting about our approach is that it shows how precise, targeted biologics can be used not just for chronic therapy but for prevention, delivered right where allergens strike,” Tabynov added. “Our approach is non-invasive, needle-free, and fast-acting [and] reduces the allergen load on the immune system and may help prevent the progression of allergic rhinitis into more severe conditions such as bronchial asthma.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As fellow pollen allergy sufferers are aware, allergic reactions tend to set off a chain reaction of misery throughout the body. The idea of blocking allergens before they ever reach the nose would be a huge relief for many patients, especially those with medical complications that prevent them from taking standard antihistamine pills. It’d also be a time-saving, cheaper alternative to immunotherapy sessions, which can take years to have any effect. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, is this something we’ll be picking up at a local pharmacy any time soon? Depends. Tabynov’s most optimistic estimate is that the first human-based studies could happen within two to three years. Additional adjustments will be needed to extend the treatment’s protective effects on human nasal surfaces. But for lifelong pollen patients, it sounds like a promising start.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Then a pioneering experimental drug – 4‑hydroxybenzoate (4‑HB) – designed to bypass his genetic deficiency, not only halted his decline but restored his mobility in just weeks. Within weeks of compassionate‑use treatment approved by the FDA at NYU Langone, he walked again – hiking, go-karting, and playing with renewed vigor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This extraordinary case, the first human success for HPDL deficiency, signals a monumental shift in rare disease therapy, transforming despair into hope. It not only redefines treatment for HPDL deficiency but also shines a beacon of hope for rare mitochondrial diseases everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to know more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From an athlete to being &lt;keyword id="2282650" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="wheelchair-bound" source="Orion"&gt;wheelchair-bound&lt;/keyword&gt;: The onset of HPDL deficiency&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid-2023, this otherwise healthy boy – a competitive runner and soccer enthusiast – started showing worrying signs: stumbling, ankle stiffness, and loss of coordination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He began experiencing involuntary muscle contractions in his ankles while playing soccer. Within months, these symptoms escalated; by November, he needed a wheelchair and struggled even to stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic testing at NYU Langone revealed biallelic mutations in the HPDL gene, essential for producing coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), a vital antioxidant for mitochondrial health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;HPDL deficiency disrupts the CoQ10 biosynthesis pathway, impairing cellular energy production. Without CoQ10, neurons and muscles lose function, leading to spasticity, paralysis, seizures, and often early death, with severe forms manifesting in infancy. In this child’s delayed-onset case, symptoms appeared later but progressed swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The CoQ10 conundrum: Why supplements aren’t enough&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;CoQ10 is widely available as a dietary supplement and is generally safe. However, CoQ10 supplements are completely ineffective in HPDL cases affecting the brain because CoQ10 molecules are too large and hydrophobic to cross the blood–brain barrier. Without reaching the brain, supplemental CoQ10 offered minimal benefit, essentially leaving the underlying condition unchecked. While CoQ10 supplements may help peripheral tissues, they leave neurological symptoms – spasticity, paralysis, and rapid degeneration – untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A biochemical breakthrough: Smart ‘tailor-made’ solution&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, researchers at NYU, led by Dr. Michael Pacold, discovered that HPDL catalyzes an early step in CoQ10 synthesis: converting 4‑hydroxy‑methyladenine (4‑HMA) to 4‑hydroxybenzoate (4‑HB), a precursor that is small and hydrophilic enough can cross the blood–brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In HPDL-deficient mice, oral 4‑HB restored CoQ10 production, significantly improved neurological function, and rescued 90% of subjects when administered early. Translating this from mice to humans presented risks, but given the rapid deterioration and the absence of other options, the child's parents and medical team pursued a compassionate-use approval from the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Compassionate use in humans: Life-changing progress&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By November 2023, with the boy’s condition worsening and time running out, NYU’s team – led by Dr. Claire Miller – obtained FDA approval for single-patient investigational use of 4‑HB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment began in December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2024, the boy began daily oral doses of 4‑HB dissolved in water. Initial mood and side effects varied – he experienced nausea occasionally – but the potential benefits were undeniable. Remarkably, within just a month, he regained the ability to walk and walked more than half a mile in Central Park. His progress was profound. Over the next year, he completed a four‑mile hike and even enjoyed go-karting – all without serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors report a significant restoration of motor function and stamina. The boy can complete his daily activities without assistance—though rigorous sports remain off-limits. There have been no severe side effects reported so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Impact and perspective: A medical breakthrough&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case represents the first successful application of 4‑HB therapy in a human with HPDL deficiency. Classified by experts as a "bench-to-bedside" success, it demonstrates how basic biological insights – like metabolic pathways – can be translated into transformative therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pacold highlighted the value of NIH-funded foundational research: without it, 4‑HB’s pathway to human use wouldn’t exist. However, experts emphasize that while the results are unprecedented, caution remains essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One patient’s outcome isn’t enough to define safety or efficacy broadly. Nevertheless, the experimental treatment offers proof-of-principle and has prompted plans for larger clinical trials across ages and HPDL variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Broader implications for rare disease care&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case highlights the potential of precision, mechanism-based therapies for ultra-rare genetic disorders – many of which lack approved treatments due to their complexity and small patient populations. It also illustrates how compassionate-use pathways can bridge the gap between preclinical research and patient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For HPDL deficiency, this success sets the stage for larger clinical trials. Researchers are now exploring the treatment’s wider applicability and grappling with whether 4‑HB acts solely by restoring CoQ10 or if other mechanisms are at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A beacon of hope for rare disease communities&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rare genetic disorders often lack effective therapies due to low patient numbers and complex biology. This milestone highlights how customized, mechanism-based interventions can break new ground. It reiterates the importance of NIH-funded basic science – Pacold’s pathway elucidation stemmed from foundational grants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Miller reflected on how “movement is identity and personality,” and described the turnaround as “heartwarming.” As the boy himself reportedly asked, "When are you going to make this a pill?" – a reminder of evolving patient-driven optimism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Looking ahead&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s ahead now? Next steps focus on clinical expansion: enrolling more pediatric patients, refining dosing, and assessing long-term outcomes. Scientists also aim to clarify whether 4‑HB works solely by boosting CoQ10 or also via unexpected mechanisms. Additionally, assessing whether similar treatments can address broader CoQ10 deficiencies is a promising, yet cautious, discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;This is how Aryan Khan spent the money in jail that he received from his father Shah Rukh Khan: Reports&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 03:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>帕金森病：常见咳嗽糖浆可减缓认知能力下降和痴呆症-印度时报 | Parkinson’s disease: Common cough syrup revealed to slow down cognitive decline and dementia - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive and complex neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement. It is narked not only by motor symptoms – such as tremors, stiffness, and bradykinesia – but also by cognitive decline. PD is also characterized by the degeneration and death of nerve cells in the brain that produce dopamine, a chemical messenger crucial for smooth and coordinated muscle movements. This loss of dopamine leads to a variety of motor and non-motor symptoms. Moreover, up to half of people with PD develop Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) within a decade, with symptoms ranging from memory loss and confusion to hallucinations and mood disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, a groundbreaking phase 2 clinical trial has revealed that a common cough medicine can stabilize psychiatric symptoms and potentially slow cognitive decline in PDD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to know more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The recent discovery&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a clinical trial, Ambroxol, a common cough medicine (used in Europe), has shown promise in slowing cognitive decline in people with Parkinson’s disease dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 12-month study conducted by researchers at Lawson Research Institute found that Ambroxol helped stabilise psychiatric symptoms, improved cognitive function, and protected against brain damage in genetically at-risk participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2835760" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; compared the outcome of the expectorant Ambroxol with a placebo among participants with Parkinson’s disease dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While primary and secondary outcomes were similar, participants on the placebo experienced worsening neuropsychiatric symptoms compared to symptoms remaining the same in the intervention group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also showed a possible improvement in cognitive symptoms for people with variants of a particular gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding Parkinson’s Dementia&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease dementia is a progressive condition superimposed on the classic movement symptoms of PD. It typically manifests in the later stages of the disease and includes cognitive impairment – memory lapses, executive dysfunction, visual hallucinations, and mood disturbances like depression or apathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 153,000 people in the UK live with PD. There is currently no cure for PDD, but patients can take medications called cholinesterase inhibitors to help manage symptoms. Existing treatments, such as cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., rivastigmine, donepezil) and memantine, may provide some symptomatic relief but fail to halt or alter the underlying neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ambroxol: From cough syrup to neuroprotection&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambroxol has been widely used in Europe for decades as a mucoactive agent – it helps clear phlegm and has an excellent safety profile. Its potential in neurodegenerative disease stems from its ability to enhance glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity, a key enzyme encoded by the GBA1 gene. Reduced GCase activity leads to the build-up of alpha-synuclein, a hallmark of PD and PDD. By enhancing GCase, Ambroxol may promote the clearance of pathological proteins and reduce brain cell damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key findings from the phase 2 trial&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Lawson Research Institute conducted a 12-month, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 55 PDD patients, administering high-dose Ambroxol (525–1,050 mg/day). The major outcomes included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Symptom stabilization:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Placebo participants experienced significant worsening in neuropsychiatric measures, while those on Ambroxol remained stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Brain injury marker (GFAP):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Serum GFAP – a biomarker of neuronal damage – increased in the placebo group but remained stable with Ambroxol, implying neuroprotective action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Cognitive improvement in high-risk individuals:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patients harboring GBA1 risk variants exhibited noticeable cognitive gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Safety and tolerance:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ambroxol was generally well-tolerated, with no serious adverse effects noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One detailed report noted that high-dose Ambroxol recipients showed improved Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores by approximately 2 points, while placebo subjects declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Limitations and the way ahead&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While findings are promising, they come from a small, single-center Phase 2 trial with limited diversity and may not be fully statistically conclusive. Certain dose‑response relationships remain unclear, and the subset of GBA1 carriers was small – about eight participants. Researchers are planning larger Phase 3 clinical trials in 2025 to specifically evaluate cognitive outcomes and determine optimal dosing strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The parting thought&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambroxol’s success could inspire wider interest in repurposing safe, existing medications for neurodegenerative disorders. It also supports the hypothesis that enhancing GCase activity may combat alpha-synuclein pathologies – a concept applicable to Parkinson’s, dementia with Lewy bodies, and potentially Gaucher disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, this study draws attention to the value of targeted precision medicine – showing particular promise in patients with genetic risk factors (e.g., GBA1 variants).

While it’s true that risk increases with age, it’s a myth that young people are immune. In fact, certain cancers are rising among younger adults, including colon cancer and breast cancer. More people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s are being diagnosed—and it’s not always due to genetics. Environmental factors, lifestyle changes, and even unknown triggers may be playing a role. That’s why awareness matters at every age. If you're young and you notice something off—unexplained fatigue, weight loss, bleeding, or a lump—don’t brush it off. Doctors are now encouraging earlier screenings in many cases for a reason.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 02:01:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-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</guid></item><item><title>随着佛蒙特州蜱虫数量的增加，卫生官员敦促采取预防措施- VTDigger | As tick populations rise in Vermont, health officials urge precautions - VTDigger</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxPVHhtNVNtdHd3M1lrUDVQaDdRRlkybFp5OG1FMHFlOXBJdHl0Yk1GeEl0ekZLNVEtZ1lVVU9FN2RhMmwwN2Mtd0ZHZWNQUTg0US1FeUY0YnhJZ29kUHNsbXVsZHF4aXRYbE9MT2RNMnRsWHdPa0VROWhxdWhKWWVYWURmRjE5dUxtd2Q0Sk1ySWIxRTU1WDBJa0xUMVFzX3BMYWFBRA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Invasive plants, new housing development and climate change are boosting tick populations in Vermont, officials say, prompting new concerns about diseases the tiny arachnids carry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although ticks have been present for a long time in Vermont, the population has grown substantially, said Patti Casey, environmental surveillance program director for the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; Markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blacklegged tick, or deer tick, is the type most frequently spotted in the state and responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/disease-control/tick-bite-illnesses/tick-activity-vermont"&gt;99% of the tick bite illnesses&lt;/a&gt; reported to the Vermont Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/data-research/facts-stats/geographic-distribution-of-tickborne-disease-cases.html"&gt;high-incidence state&lt;/a&gt; for several blacklegged tick-driven tick-borne diseases,” said Natalie Kwit, public health veterinarian for the state Department of Health. “For Lyme disease, we have had over 1,000 cases in 2023.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the&lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/document/2018-2022%20Tick%20Pathogen%20Surv%20Report.pdf"&gt; 2018-22&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/document/2018-2022%20Tick%20Pathogen%20Surv%20Report.pdf"&gt;Tick Pathogen Surveillance Report&lt;/a&gt; by the Department of Health, more than half of the blacklegged ticks analyzed carry &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/disease-control/tick-bite-illnesses/lyme-disease"&gt;Lyme disease&lt;/a&gt;, an infection that can be transmitted to humans and cause symptoms like fever, fatigue, headache, skin rash, and if left untreated can affect heart, joints, and the nervous system. In Vermont, Chittenden, Windsor and Rutland counties had the highest prevalence of blacklegged ticks infected with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ticks can be found any time of the year when the temperature is above freezing, with their peak activity being in May and June and then again in October and November. Ticks survive by biting their host for blood, which leads to the transmission of diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/disease-control/tick-bite-illnesses/prevent-tick-bites-tickborne-diseases"&gt;tick bite illnesses&lt;/a&gt; recorded in Vermont are anaplasmosis, babesiosis, hard tick relapsing fever, and Powassan virus disease, which is very rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2015, Vermont has had the nation’s highest annual number of cases of &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/disease-control/tick-bite-illnesses/anaplasmosis"&gt;anaplasmosis&lt;/a&gt;. Symptoms are similar to those of Lyme disease except for the skin rash. The most common effects are fever, muscle aches, chills, malaise and headaches, but the disease can also cause people to develop anemia, low white blood cell counts, low platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes. The illness can have serious consequences if not treated, especially for old patients or people with health problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American dog tick, brown dog tick, squirrel tick and woodchuck tick are other &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/disease-control/tick-bite-illnesses/tick-activity-vermont"&gt;common ticks&lt;/a&gt; found in Vermont. The lone star tick, which carries &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alpha-gal-syndrome/about/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/alpha-gal/index.html"&gt;alpha-gal syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, an illness that leads to the development of a red meat allergy, is not fully established in Vermont.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“We’re not seeing any of the lone star tick-driven tick-borne diseases in Vermont in humans, so we’re pretty confident that they’re not here, but it doesn’t mean that they can’t geographically expand to be in Vermont in the future,” Kwit said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent tick bites, Casey suggests wearing long pants tucked into socks and long-sleeve shirts when spending time outdoors in areas where ticks prosper to spot ticks more easily if they end up on clothes. Spraying &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/find-repellent-right-you"&gt;EPA-registered repellents&lt;/a&gt; or treating clothes with permethrin is also recommended to keep ticks away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once home, it’s advisable to put the clothes in the dryer on high heat for 10 minutes to kill potential ticks and take a shower, checking the body and scalp to spot bumps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case there is a tick, it should be removed quickly using tweezers, grabbing the tick as close as possible to the skin surface and pulling upward steadily, and then cleaning the area with rubbing alcohol, soap and water. The Vermont Department of Health provides detailed&lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/disease-control/tick-bite-illnesses/prevent-tick-bites-tickborne-diseases"&gt; guidelines&lt;/a&gt; on how to remove ticks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Agency of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; Markets allows people to &lt;a href="https://agriculture.vermont.gov/public-health-agricultural-resource-management-division/plant-health-and-pest-management/ticks-1"&gt;send ticks to be identified&lt;/a&gt;. The agency doesn’t test the ticks for diseases, but it will inform people of the species, sex and age of the tick, giving them information they can tell their doctor to assess the best course of treatment in case they later develop symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since many people don’t realize they have been bitten by a tick, experts recommend being on the lookout for potential symptoms, especially after outdoor activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agency also conducts a &lt;a href="https://agriculture.vermont.gov/vt-agency-agriculture-food-and-markets-tick-surveillance"&gt;tick surveillance program&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with the Vermont Health Department and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, collecting ticks across Vermont to test them and gather data on tick species, their habitats and the diseases they may carry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Casey said the program has been temporarily suspended this year due to uncertainty surrounding funding. The priority has instead shifted to mosquito surveillance to track illnesses such as &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/disease-control/mosquito-borne-diseases/eastern-equine-encephalitis"&gt;Eastern equine encephalitis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Most of us live in Vermont, in part, because it’s so beautiful, and we like to be outdoors in it. And it’s just that things have changed a little bit, and now we need to be very vigilant about interactions with ticks to try to avoid tick bites,” Casey said. “The good news is that if we’re careful, we can really drastically lower our risk for contracting a tick-borne illness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: &lt;em&gt;Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this story incorrectly described ticks.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Yet, despite the pain it's caused, there are still some significant misconceptions about &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-to-never-do-after-eating-lunch-according-to-cardiologist" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, such as that cardiovascular issues are limited to &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/one-thing-you-should-never-do-if-you-want-to-lower-heart-attack-risk-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart attacks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;. On TV, heart attacks are often portrayed as sudden, spontaneous and involving chest pain as the first symptom of a problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet, heart disease includes a range of conditions, including &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/i-lowered-my-high-blood-pressure-here-is-how-i-did-it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;. The first signs that there's an issue can also be silent. However, cardiologists are making a loud call for people to pay attention to the subtle clues of heart trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Heart disease is one of the most common and potentially serious medical conditions," explains &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Cheng-Han Chen, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Cheng-Han Chen, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center. "Evaluating potential heart problems can prevent them from getting worse, and maybe even save your life."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Understanding this often-overlooked and silent sign of heart trouble is one way to protect yourself. Cardiologists discuss the symptom, why it's easy to miss and what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🩺 &lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/healthy-now" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week&lt;/a&gt; 💊&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The No. 1 Silent Sign of Heart Trouble, Cardiologists Warn&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiologists reveal that fatigue can be easily overlooked as a sign of a potential heart issue, and it's especially prevalent among specific individuals. "Women and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/vegetable-diabetes-prevention-study-march-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:people with diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;people with diabetes&lt;/a&gt; may not have typical symptoms, and they may only note fatigue, nausea or 'just not feeling right,'" says &lt;a href="https://vitalsolution.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Bradley Serwer, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Bradley Serwer, MD&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; an interventional cardiologist and chief medical officer at VitalSolution, an &lt;a href="http://www.ingenovishealth.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ingenovis Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ingenovis Health&lt;/a&gt; company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-failure/warning-signs-of-heart-failure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Heart Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; and a 2023 study in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8795245/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of Cardiac Failure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Journal of Cardiac Failure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; both report that fatigue and extreme tiredness are common signs of heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the heart muscle is weakened, it may not be able to pump as much blood as the body needs, leading to fatigue," explains &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/dr-randy-gould/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Randy Gould, DO;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Randy Gould, DO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist with Manhattan Cardiology in NYC and contributor to &lt;a href="https://www.labfinder.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:labfinder.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;labfinder.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Serwer adds that conditions like congestive heart failure can lead to a buildup in the lungs that complicates this oxygen exchange, triggering chronic fatigue and shortness of breath. The shortness of breath can also affect sleep, setting off a vicious cycle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Many times, lying down makes people short of breath, and they often have to sleep sitting up," he says. "This results in inefficient sleep, which then presents as fatigue."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-happens-to-your-blood-pressure-when-you-eat-blueberries-every-day" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Here’s What Happens to Your Blood Pressure When You Eat Blueberries Every Day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Here’s What Happens to Your Blood Pressure When You Eat Blueberries Every Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why It's Easy To Miss Fatigue as a Sign of Heart Problems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, people may write off chronic fatigue as "simply" poor sleep, hence why this sign of heart trouble seems silent. Dr. Gould notes that people may also attribute their fatigue to stress or aging, and Dr. Serwer reports that people often think they can white-knuckle through extreme tiredness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We often think that fatigue will simply go away on its own," Dr. Serwer reveals. "We are taught that chest pain, severe shortness of breath or even passing out may be due to a heart attack. When people experience less dramatic symptoms, they often get minimized and overlooked."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, does this mean fatigue is &lt;em&gt;always &lt;/em&gt;a sign of a heart issue? No, but Dr. Chen says it's worth exploring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Fatigue is a common symptom that can be due to many possible reasons, including both lifestyle factors and medical conditions," he explains. "It is sometimes difficult to determine the cause without a comprehensive medical evaluation."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-to-never-do-after-eating-lunch-according-to-cardiologist" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The One Thing You Should Never, Ever Do in the Hour After Eating Lunch, According to a Cardiologist;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The One Thing You Should Never, Ever Do in the Hour After Eating Lunch, According to a Cardiologist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When Fatigue Is a Sign of Heart Trouble&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you just tired or dealing with a heart issue? For starters, if in doubt, get checked out. That said, heart-related fatigue can have a distinct feel. "Patients usually state that they feel tired all the time, and increased sleep/rest does not improve their symptoms," Dr. Gould says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Think about how much effort you need to do a daily task. "The symptoms [of fatigue] are out of proportion to the amount of effort expended," Dr. Serwer says. "As the symptoms progress, the patient often says that they can’t even complete normal activities of daily living such as dressing, cooking or cleaning. They often complain of brain fatigue, which can be a result of low oxygen levels."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/habit-people-with-hypertension-should-break-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cardiologists Are Begging People With Hypertension To Stop Doing This One Thing ASAP;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cardiologists Are Begging People With Hypertension To Stop Doing This One Thing ASAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Easy-to-Miss Signs of Heart Trouble and What To Do&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extreme fatigue isn't the only sign of heart trouble. Dr. Chen also warns that signs you or a loved one is experiencing a cardiovascular issue include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Serwer is begging people to take his advice to heart: "Pay attention to the symptoms and do not ignore them," he advises. "Depending on the symptoms, an emergent or urgent medical evaluation is important. If the emergency room providers don’t identify a heart attack or an immediate life-threatening condition, they may refer the patient to a cardiologist for a more detailed workup."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/relaxing-habit-harming-heart-health-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: I'm a Cardiologist, and This 'Relaxing' Habit Is Actually Harming Your Heart Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: I'm a Cardiologist, and This 'Relaxing' Habit Is Actually Harming Your Heart Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-heart-condition-sign-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Heart Trouble;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Heart Trouble&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on Parade on Jul 10, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally reported by &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-heart-condition-sign-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt; on Jul 10, 2025, where it first appeared.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 23:57:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBjNjNWWlVUN3FxbkpBUm5mMkRQTWpPbV9JUk81TjBOUFFZQ3ZiUkNMTmp5RXFFMEswQmFZdWdqaXNjMUJPU3dOVC1ydHBYRm1pOEVDSXNXYUZiQWU0QzAtV3lHd2hjOHpUYzF2ckM1WTNfQlZu</guid></item></channel></rss>
