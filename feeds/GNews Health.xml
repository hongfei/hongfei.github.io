&lt;p&gt;I’ve been sick with COVID this past week, missing the first classes of the fall semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was exposed by a cancer patient who finished a second round of chemotherapy earlier this month. They weren’t vaccinated within the last year because they were undergoing chemo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were exposed after Saturday evening mass at their Catholic church in Florida, where others around them were likely not vaccinated, and definitely unmasked, unlike the cancer patient. A dementia patient who refused to mask was the vector between the congregation and the cancer patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cancer patient is still recovering and now at about 90% of their capacity. They’re moving very slowly, thinking just as slowly. They can’t be left alone because they don’t have the reaction time they used to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m about 95% recovered, still have some sinus congestion and lingering crud in my chest. My ribs and my throat feel still feel bruised from hacking up my lungs so hard earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’m not certain I’ll recover from is the trauma of having to check my father the cancer patient for a pulse last week when he collapsed on the kitchen floor, reviving him, getting him up and moving and into my car so I could rush him from their remote home to an urgent care facility more than 30 minutes away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t think to put a mask on him or a mask on myself at the time because I was worried something had gone very wrong after my dad’s two-year fight with cancer. I was worried about the monsoon-like storm I had to drive through to get to urgent care. I thought erroneously he had recovered from COVID and wasn’t contagious because he hadn’t had a fever and he hadn’t been coughing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I unintentionally hot boxed my dad’s COVID-laden exhalations in my car for 30 minutes trying to save my father. I’d do it again if it came down to it but I should never have had to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This country has been deeply damaged enough by the anti-vaccine movement since the COVID pandemic began; it shouldn’t have to face worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~ ~ ~&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now you’ve read &lt;a href="https://www.emptywheel.net/2025/08/28/cdc-shooting-2-0-its-coming-from-inside-the-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"&gt;Peterr’s Thursday post&lt;/a&gt; about the government’s internecine warfare at the Centers for Disease Control and the excision of director Susan Monarez, followed by the protest resignations of senior CDC staff in support of Monarez. The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/cdc-leaders-quit-susan-monarez-firing" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;senior staff who resigned&lt;/a&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Demetre Daskalakis, former director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases&lt;br&gt;
• Debra Houry, former chief medical officer and deputy director for program and science&lt;br&gt;
• Daniel Jernigan, former director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases&lt;br&gt;
• Jennifer Layden, former director of office of public health data, science, technology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these individuals has a deep background and education in medicine, healthcare, or public health. None of then should have been expected compromise themselves to support our nation’s public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of them should have been treated so shabbily by RFK Jr.’s shit-tastic management of HHS. It’s not at all hyperbole to call it shit-tastic; I strongly recommend listening to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/29/podcasts/the-daily/cdc-vaccine-daskalakis.html?" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;The New York Times’ podcast interview with Demetre Daskalakis&lt;/a&gt; because it will rid you of any doubt the label is deserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an excerpt I found particularly telling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: Yeah. So this was not related to ACIP, the announcement by the Secretary to change the childhood schedule. I learned about the change of the childhood schedule on X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: You learned about it on social media —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: Yes, ma’am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: — like the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: That is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: So I was sitting in a meeting with senior leaders at CDC. And as I was sitting there talking about the outbreaks that I was managing, my phone blew up with, “I didn’t know you guys were changing the children’s schedule.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: People texting you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: Not from HHS, people in the world. Because they saw —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: People in the world, your friends and family or whoever seeing this and being like, this doesn’t sound like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: Correct. So we then asked the question, what’s going on? Can we see some kind of documentation? Because they were like, implement the change. But we’ve never seen anything in writing, so we asked if we could see the supporting data that led to the decision. And we were told no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: Just flat out no?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: Flat out no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: But can I ask you, did you ever actually have a conversation with Kennedy about any of this or any of his senior staffers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: Or is it just that —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: No communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: Did you ever try?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: And what would happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: So we offered to do briefings when he first started. I think some people were able to brief some lower level staff, but not staff that were Secretary Kennedy’s staff. So no one from my center has ever briefed the Secretary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: On anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: Correct, on anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: So basically, don’t have a line into RFK, and he’s not seeking out your advice or the advice of people who are theoretically supposed to advise him on things like this. How did you feel about that at the time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: I felt that this was highly atypical, that we weren’t able to share our expertise up the chain to be able to provide information that could be meaningful and thought process. And so what I kept thinking was, we’re not doing this, but there sure is a point of view up there. I wonder who’s doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My job is to make sure that we’re giving good science so people can make good decisions. And if I can’t make sure that science is untouched by non-scientific influence, I cannot say that I’m doing my job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that CDC science is going to be compromised by HHS. And if that science becomes biased, if it gets unduly influenced, then I can’t have my name on that science as something that I think should be used to make important decisions for people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I strongly recommend &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/29/podcasts/the-daily/cdc-vaccine-daskalakis.html?" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;listening to this podcast&lt;/a&gt;. The other disturbing facet is the way in which Abrams just plows on; it could be an artifact of editing, but it could be another of the many ways in which media has not paused and shouted at the public how disturbing and inappropriate are RFK Jr.’s and Trump’s management of public health, in a misguided effort to remain neutral about a subject which isn’t and can’t be neutral at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can a US media outlet be neutral in the face of what looks increasingly like an occupation of government agencies by hostile forces? In the case of the CDC under RFK Jr.’s HHS, it’s damaging the administration of vaccinations to the entire country while undermining the nation’s ability to respond to pandemic and bioterrorism, not to mention its ability to safely provide basic healthcare. No one will be unaffected; no one can be neutral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~ ~ ~&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not kidding when I say our healthcare is now utterly compromised. Our first responders and healthcare providers can’t be assured of necessary vaccinations. From an &lt;a href="https://mstdn.social/@mcnado/115104500547733326" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;ER doctor on Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is absolute bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/05/how-robert-f-kennedy-jr-became-anti-vaxxer-icon-nightmare" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;One of the biggest purveyors of anti-vaccine propaganda&lt;/a&gt;, one without any healthcare education and training, has decided the persons most likely to be exposed to diseases on a daily basis are no longer eligible for COVID vaccinations if they do not have a limited number of pre-existing chronic health problems. From &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:njhuquor23vkkeamltaxdsnz/post/3lxghtgwstc2d" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;Jen Bendery on Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.emptywheel.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot_Bluesky_JenBendery-CDCCovidVax_27AUG2025.png" data-wpel-link="internal"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-139965" src="https://www.emptywheel.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot_Bluesky_JenBendery-CDCCovidVax_27AUG2025-114x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.emptywheel.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot_Bluesky_JenBendery-CDCCovidVax_27AUG2025-114x300.png 114w, https://www.emptywheel.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot_Bluesky_JenBendery-CDCCovidVax_27AUG2025-392x1030.png 392w, https://www.emptywheel.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot_Bluesky_JenBendery-CDCCovidVax_27AUG2025-268x705.png 268w, https://www.emptywheel.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot_Bluesky_JenBendery-CDCCovidVax_27AUG2025.png 536w" sizes="(max-width: 114px) 100vw, 114px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For the record, my autoimmune disorder which has cost me lung capacity, is not on this list. I am not eligible for another COVID shot until I turn 65.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a recipe for disaster. Not only are &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/08/24/rural-america-braces-for-hospital-closures-after-medicaid-cuts/85723643007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;rural hospitals at risk because of cuts to Medicare under Trump’s Big Fugly Bill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; hospitals are at risk if their staff can’t be vaccinated readily in the face of a new COVID wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my father were to become sick again and collapse like he did, could he be assured there would be healthcare personnel ready to receive and treat him? Or might the healthcare system be overwhelmed and triage him to the very end of the line?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same goes for any of the rest of us, really. How can anyone in the US be assured the healthcare system will be able to respond if RFK Jr. is allowed to continue to hack away at it without supporting data, without support by seasoned, qualified professionals, without adequate oversight by Congress?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~ ~ ~&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the many things that raced through my mind as I tried to revive my dad was the thought we had not talked about DNR status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty sure my dad and mom have both indicated on healthcare POAs they are DNR under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens, though, when one of them collapses at home? Should I have left him on the floor while ensuring his comfort?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously I didn’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a little over a week later I can’t help wonder if RFK Jr. has now forced DNR on swaths of Americans, and we’re already DNR where we are in our own homes whether we realize it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our healthcare system collapses because of his anti-vaccine and anti-healthcare regime, is he not assuring our healthcare system cannot resuscitate many of us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would this be different under a hostile foreign occupation?&lt;/p&gt;

is characterized by the degeneration and shrinking of the front and sides of the brain, which then results in behavioral and personality changes—and like in Willis’s case, affects memory, one’s ability to think, and speak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eating is another aspect of the patient’s life affected by the illness.

This breeds a “learnt resignation”, Wright says. But she says that if we prioritise mobility, muscle-building, flexibility and hormonal health, it doesn’t have to be that way — and she’s determined it won’t be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;We don’t always help ourselves. Wright sees&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; many “underfed, under-proteined” women. They say, “‘I drink my coffee in the morning, I’ll have a salad at lunch, I may not eat till 2 or 3,’” she tells me, speaking from her clinic in Orlando, Florida. “Our body needs a lot of protein to build muscle. Women have been taught our whole lives, in my generation, to be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; big” — Wright pinches thumb and forefinger together — “and the fact is, you have to feed yourself to age well and not to become frail.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Wright, 58, is impressive. She’s founding director of the Performance and Research Initiative for Masters Athletes, a longevity specialist and recently gave evidence to America’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as part of an expert panel on menopause and HRT. She looks robust and fabulous, with jet-black hair, manicured nails. In her new book, &lt;i&gt;Unbreakable: A Woman’s Guide to Ageing With Power&lt;/i&gt;, she talks of regaining her “badassery”. It’s hard to believe it ever left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/what-i-wish-id-known-about-my-body-when-i-was-younger-fz2pv0tbs" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What I wish I’d known about my body when I was younger&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;And yet while her early forties were steel-wrought — triathlons, 19 per cent body fat — the perimenopause hit hard. “At 47 I thought I was going to die,” she says. Her brain was foggy. Her body hurt. She was weaker. “I had back fat hanging out of my bra.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Well, no longer. Wright has rebuilt herself and so can we all. &lt;i&gt;Unbreakable&lt;/i&gt; is a galvanising, meticulously detailed, science-based call to arms — powerful arms — for all women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Keep moving to shield against the “time bombs” of ageing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Exercise helps defuse the “time bombs of ageing”. Conversely, being a long-term couch potato increases the risk of 33 chronic diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, atherosclerosis, lung disease and metabolic syndrome, Wright says. This is known as “sedentary death syndrome”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.7"&gt;&lt;div id="932b9c88-9414-48a9-8f6a-635d33507d9e"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Perform fewer reps with heavier weights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“There is not an organ system in our body that is not affected by mobility,” she says. Flexing biceps or squatting doesn’t just build muscle, it produces chemicals that help build brain tissue and promote insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;As for the ageing “time bombs”, they include DNA damage such as telomere shortening — according to Wright just six months of aerobic activity lengthens telomeres, which protect our genetic data. Another is “inflammaging”, chronic low-grade inflammation contributing factors for which can include stress and menopause. For Wright, structured cardio and resistance training, plus an anti-inflammatory diet, are the answer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/over-50-osteoporosis-health-help-anna-maxted-72trtxz59" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I’m 55, eat well, don’t smoke and exercise. Yet I also have osteoporosis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The third bomb? Dysfunction of the mitochondria. These “power plants” of our cells convert food into energy and if they’re in poor shape, metabolic problems follow. But running, swimming and cycling help create new mitochondria. Another time bomb is cell senescence, where damaged “zombie cells” contribute to inflammation. Just 12 weeks of moderate aerobic exercise can decrease their numbers and improve macroautophagy, our cells’ self-cleaning mechanism, Wright says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Understand the musculoskeletal syndrome of menopause&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In a recent paper Wright defined “the musculoskeletal syndrome of menopause”, joining the dots for the 70 per cent of women who suffer from a host of apparently unrelated symptoms, including joint stiffness, muscle loss and fat gain. Muscle, Wright says, is “the engine that drives your health span”. Not only does it help regulate blood sugar and metabolism, it churns out hormones that protect brain and heart, and helps keep bones strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Menopause ratchets up muscle loss (and increases inflammation). “Oestrogen plays a critical role in muscle health and muscle protein synthesis,” Wright says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Our bones, tendons, ligaments and cartilage are similarly affected by oestrogen’s decline. So less oestrogen in say, cartilage, and women suddenly suffer far more arthritis than men, Wright says. As for bones, they don’t just hold us up, they secrete the hormone osteocalcin, which helps the brain by increasing neurotransmitter production, and aids insulin sensitivity and glucose regulation. Oestrogen is critical for bone and women experience a “precipitous drop in up to 20 per cent of bone density in the five to seven years surrounding menopause”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/fit-for-age-exercises-8whjncsxm" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Am I fit for my age? Exercises for your 30s to your 70s&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Wright is a big fan of HRT for osteoporosis prevention but it’s not a cure-all, she says. To become strong, she says, “You still must invest in the physical, the nutritional, the social.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Flexibility is crucial — but Pilates should be the ‘garnish’ &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Wright prescribes exercise using the acronym FACE (Flexibility and mobility; aerobic capacity; ability to carry a load; and equilibrium and foot speed). Maintaining flexibility should be a “several times a week” practice: stretching helps combat the effects of ageing on tendon and ligaments. Otherwise, she says, “our joints lose mobility, our tendons and ligaments get tighter. It’s why we see people shuffling down the street instead of striding”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;While regular yoga, Pilates and barre improve muscle endurance and prevent stiffness, Wright adds that “they do not create any significant lean muscle mass gain or absolute power”. She describes Pilates as — gulp — “garnish”. “I’m not saying ‘give it up, people’,” she says. “I’m saying, ‘It’s never going to be enough.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.23"&gt;&lt;div id="6a9c9161-45e2-42ef-9703-879fecafca30"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Even 10 to 20 jump  repetitions a  day  can increase  strength&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Jump around&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Jump training (or plyometrics) increases our power, speed and athleticism. Wright says that springing up forces us to use our fast-twitch muscles, which decline with age, and then it “forces us to land”. This signals to the body to build more bone. Some midlife women avoid jumping, often because of pelvic-floor trouble, “But pelvic floors can be retrained”, Wright says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;You don’t have to leap onto a 24in box (as Wright does). Skipping or hopscotch is great, and just 10 to 20 jump repetitions a day can increase bone mass and strength. As a convert to the joys of midlife jumping, I tell Wright that it’s amazing to feel springy as opposed to leaden. “I love that you said that,” she exclaims. “There’s a certain ableness that comes from ‘I can run up those stairs! Getting over this barrier is nothing because I’m jumping!’ It’s mind and body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/hrt-what-every-woman-needs-to-know-now-jjv8prxdq" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;HRT: what every woman needs to know now&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;In midlife don’t HIIT it too hard&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Too much high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in midlife is counterproductive, Wright says. A 2021 study found that while two to three HIIT sessions per week improved volunteers’ health, when they increased it to five their mitochondria produced less energy, plus they developed impaired glucose tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In midlife you’re prone to injury from overuse. Plus, Wright says, “because it’s hard, you’ll elevate your cortisol every day”. It can lead to issues such as elevated blood sugar and higher blood pressure. When midlife women tell Wright they exercise daily but are gaining weight, this is often why, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Wright describes exercise in terms of zones one to five, “with zone one being very little effort and zone five being as hard as you can go”. She recommends that 80 per cent of your cardio training is in zone two — you’ll know you’re there if you could manage a phone call, talking in full sentences, but the other person would be able to tell you were exerting yourself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The remaining 20 per cent of your training should be in zone five. This ratio is great for “metabolic flexibility”. But most people “work in the middle” — around zones three and four, she says. As well as raising cortisol, “It’s not as efficient at maintaining metabolic flexibility. And it doesn’t really recompose their body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For her zone two exercise Wright walks on a treadmill at an incline of 5 per cent, at four miles per hour for 45 minutes. Then, “I punch the button up to 11. And I’m just going as fast as my short legs will carry me and not fly off the back.” Try also, bike, rower, sprints, battle ropes — whatever “jacks your heart rate up.” (This is called SIT — sprint interval training). Do this for 30 seconds, then recover over two minutes, and repeat up to four times. With your doctor’s blessing, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.36"&gt;&lt;div id="b91c4c46-9292-4c6a-86fc-d1a53ebc19b0"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Bench presses: try four sets of four reps using higher weights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;How to lift for power&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I don’t lift weights to look good in my little black dress,” Wright says. “The goal of the way I prescribe lifting is strength — to be able to pick up my 40-pound grandson or to put things away without having to ask the neighbour to come help me, for God’s sake.” Also, “Power to get up off the floor and power to catch myself so I don’t land on the floor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/boost-your-bones-with-exercise-hd78njjw8" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The 7 best exercises to keep your bones strong&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This is surely what we all want but will 20 biceps curls with 5kg weights do it? “There are many ways to lift. None of them are wrong. But what is our goal?” Wright says. “Well, if our goal is to build endurance — carry a backpack up Machu Picchu or something — then do exactly what you said: lift the lightest possible weight, the most possible times.” She pauses. “That is not my goal as a midlife woman and beyond.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;To age with max badassery, she says we should do lower reps of higher weights — for example, with bench presses she’d prescribe four sets of four reps. You work almost to failure, meaning, “We could lift a fifth bench press — but we cannot lift six.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It’s a learnt skill and can take nine months to grasp. “Once we learn to lift heavy, and we feel comfortable, that’s when we can add speed to our lifts,” she adds — so doing a squat, “We go down slow, 1, 2, 3, then we explode up”. This builds power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Technique is crucial, so it’s worth going all in. “This isn’t the time to ask for a new purse for Christmas again,” Wright says. “Let’s invest in a trainer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Unbreakable: A Woman’s Guide to Ageing with Power &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;by Vonda Wright is out now (Vermilion, £20)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxPVExKcjl6NTF2ZnE0TncxcmZBaVZxZTZkdmRROVIzNGkxazA3bS1LaHFYc195Q09GdjQ1UWJDU2VJdjlpVVpGcmktcGtMWGloRm10NURvV29ic2lUUXBKeVNHOGxLZlVkSGZMN0NnMmZIbGpMLXhKV29Pd1ZKWTdsTTRWRTB6dkNucFVwelFwRXg4RklLMDlpQjFwUDhaWlp4OUJrdTBiYkg1QjR4LV9ycF9tZHdZVFNya3ZlT2dn</guid></item><item><title>心理学家发现，自恋者被一种特定的新闻故事所吸引- PsyPost</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/narcissists-are-drawn-to-a-particular-kind-of-news-story-psychologists-find/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2025.104653" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Research in Personality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; suggests that individuals high in antagonistic narcissism are more likely to gravitate toward antisocial news content while showing less interest in stories about prosocial behavior. This tendency appears to be related to lower levels of empathy and a greater need for intense stimulation, traits commonly linked with antagonistic forms of narcissism. The findings point to a psychological pattern in how narcissistic individuals consume social information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narcissistic individuals tend to display a grandiose view of themselves, a preoccupation with status, and low regard for others. Much prior research has explored how narcissists behave in interpersonal situations—as the central actors or “protagonists”—often revealing a pattern of manipulative or hostile behavior. But social life also includes observing others, such as through news and media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study focused on what narcissists prefer to observe, particularly in terms of prosocial (helping) versus antisocial (harming) behavior in others. Prior work had already shown that narcissists often respond more favorably to antisocial behavior in others and evaluate prosocial individuals more negatively. What remained unknown was whether this pattern began even earlier in the information-processing pipeline: in the initial act of choosing what to pay attention to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers proposed that narcissists, especially those high in antagonistic traits such as arrogance and aggression, may prefer antisocial news content that reflects their own worldview. Drawing on person-environment fit theory, they suggested that individuals are drawn to environments and information that align with their own traits and values. In this case, narcissistic individuals may experience a better fit with antisocial content and a poorer fit with prosocial material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Broadly, my research is motivated by an interest in how narcissistic individuals engage with the communal side of social life — aspects such as cooperation, morality, and kindness,” said study author Jiafang Chen of the University of Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This angle has received much less attention compared to the traditional focus on power, achievement, and social status. I believe that examining the communal dimension offers fresh insights into how narcissists shape their social environments, especially since they often end up in leadership positions and serve as role models. A natural starting point is to examine how narcissistic individuals are drawn to different kinds of social information in daily life, which both reflects who they are and reinforces their behavioral patterns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research involved two main studies and a set of pilot studies to design the news headline task. First, the team created and tested news headlines classified as antisocial, prosocial, or neutral. They made sure these headlines differed in perceived social impact but were equally interesting and exciting to read. This allowed them to isolate the effects of narcissistic traits on content preference without confounding factors like novelty or shock value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, antisocial headlines included: “Supervisor sexually harasses multiple interns” and “Mother and daughter throw stones at sleeping animals in a zoo.” Prosocial headlines featured examples like “Steep increase in blood donors” and “Passerby helps fallen blind person get up.” Neutral headlines included more observational or factual events, such as “First passengers try high-speed vacuum pods” or “250 million users active on Snapchat each day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first main study, 253 participants completed a narcissism questionnaire and then chose ten out of thirty news headlines they would like to read. The headlines were evenly distributed among the antisocial, prosocial, and neutral categories. The researchers found that people with higher levels of antagonistic narcissism were more likely to pick antisocial headlines and less likely to select prosocial ones, compared to those lower in antagonistic narcissism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second study replicated these findings in a separate sample of 294 participants. This time, the researchers also measured three possible underlying traits that could explain the narcissists’ choices: their social motives, their capacity for empathy, and their level of sensation seeking. The idea was that narcissists might choose antisocial information not simply because they enjoy it, but because it better fits with their internal traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings showed that narcissistic individuals were less empathetic and more likely to seek intense, novel experiences—both of which were linked to a stronger preference for antisocial content and a weaker interest in prosocial content. Importantly, these two traits (low empathy and high sensation seeking) statistically accounted for the relationship between narcissism and information preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across both studies, the data provided consistent evidence that antagonistic narcissism is associated with a selective preference for antisocial social information. In the first study, this pattern was clear: narcissistic individuals picked more antisocial and fewer prosocial headlines. In the second study, the effect was driven more by their reduced interest in prosocial stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that this selection pattern was not random or incidental. When they analyzed what explained these choices, two key psychological traits emerged. Narcissistic individuals tended to score lower in affective empathy—the ability to feel compassion for others—which predicted a dislike for prosocial stories and a relative openness to antisocial ones. They also scored higher in sensation seeking, which predicted a stronger interest in stories involving harm, rule-breaking, or social conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, social motives—whether participants were more self-focused or altruistic—did not significantly mediate the effect. The authors suggest that simply being focused on one’s own outcomes may not be enough to explain why narcissists are attracted to antisocial content. Instead, the emotional detachment and desire for stimulation seen in these individuals may be more relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A follow-up meta-analysis combining data from both studies confirmed that antagonistic narcissism reliably predicted a preference for antisocial over prosocial information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main takeaway from our findings is that narcissistic individuals are more drawn to antisocial information—stories about others’ misbehavior—while showing less interest in prosocial information, such as acts of kindness or cooperation,” Chen told PsyPost. “This preference can be explained by their low affective empathy and heightened sensation-seeking tendencies. Together, these findings suggest that narcissists’ selection of social information not only reflects who they are but also reinforces their characteristic ways of engaging with the social world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are some limitations to consider. While the studies employed a task that mirrored real-life media consumption, they relied on self-reported data and correlational designs. This makes it difficult to draw conclusions about causality. For instance, it is not clear whether choosing antisocial content leads narcissists to behave more antisocially themselves—or whether these behaviors are simply consistent across domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the study focused only on one specific form of narcissism: the antagonistic subtype. Narcissism is a complex and multidimensional trait that also includes more agentic (status-seeking) and neurotic (insecure) forms. While the authors did briefly explore these other dimensions, they found that antagonistic narcissism had the strongest and most consistent association with antisocial information preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could explore whether repeatedly consuming antisocial content reinforces narcissists’ existing tendencies or shapes their behaviors over time. It might also test whether increasing exposure to prosocial stories could nudge narcissistic individuals toward more cooperative or empathetic actions. Some evidence suggests that such “communal activation” can temporarily soften narcissistic traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also recommend further work on other psychological traits—such as schadenfreude or envy—that may explain why some individuals take pleasure in others’ misfortunes and seek out news reflecting those scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2025.104653" target="_blank"&gt;You are what you read: Antagonistic narcissism predicts increased preference for antisocial and reduced preference for prosocial information&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jiafang Chen, Barbara Nevicka, Astrid C.

&lt;p&gt;“If you want to build muscle mass, engage in a regular program of strength training or resistance exercise, and focus on healthy food sources of protein,” Mozaffarian said. “Otherwise, emphasize a generally healthy diet, and rather than being obsessed with protein, seek out minimally processed fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, whole grains, plant oils, fish and yogurt. Avoid soda, candy, processed meat and ultraprocessed foods high in starch, sugar or salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Focus on the food source and its overall impact on your health, rather than the grams of protein,” Mozaffarian said. “Avoid processed meats, ultraprocessed foods like protein bars and protein powders. Protein-rich foods with evidence for general health benefits include fish, shellfish, yogurt, cheese and milk. Legumes, grains and nuts also provide protein and substantial health benefits. Unprocessed red meats are OK in moderation, up to two servings per week.”&lt;/p&gt;

It also puts patients at risk of an infection, or life-threatening &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/sepsis/index.html" id="mol-188c1ee0-851c-11f0-bc97-090efcca62a4"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it was another five months before Latimer went to the hospital, according to the lawsuit she recently filed against the doctor and his clinic, saying she that the surgeon and clinic kept assuring her she was 'progressing nicely'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Latimer saw Dr Salgado three times after her nipples turned black, according to the lawsuit, who prescribed her creams to repair 'superficial skin damage'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Latimer also exchanged numerous texts with the clinic, regularly submitting pictures of her deteriorating nipples and areolas for Dr Salgado to review, the lawsuit says, but was told that there was nothing to be concerned about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above texts, included in Latimer's lawsuit, were sent by Latimer to the clinic after she said her nipples had fallen off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ahead of the publication of this story, DailyMail.com contacted Dr Salgado and The Secret Plastic Surgery for comment but did not receive a response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Latimer first contacted the clinic in July 2023 on the advice of a friend, and was initially approved for the surgeries by Dr Orlando Llorente. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, after a blood test showed she had a low red blood cell count, raising the risk of infections or complications such as cardiac arrest, the procedure was canceled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Latimer had also had a breast lift about a decade earlier, which can make a second surgery more risky because there may be scar tissue from the first procedure that is disrupting the blood supply to the chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Latimer thought she would not be able to get the surgery, but about two weeks later, the clinic contacted her again and said Dr Salgado had agreed to do her operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She went for the procedure on August 22, with her lawyers saying in filings that no breast exam or inspection of scar tissue was carried out before the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the complaint, the day after the surgery, she returned to the clinic to have photos taken, which showed her nipples were already black and full of blood. She alleges she was not offered any treatments at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Salgado saw her again about a month after the surgery, telling her, according to the lawsuit, that she was recovering well, despite the color of her nipples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Machelle Latimer, 46, pictured above at home in Miami, Florida. She is seeking a trial by jury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He applied collagen to the nipples and areolas, the lawsuit claimed, a treatment that can be used to repair damaged skin, and told her to return in two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her breasts continued to deteriorate, however, with Latimer texting in more photos to the clinic in October that still showed black skin over her nipples and areolas, indicating that the nipples and areolas had died on the left breast and partially died on the right breast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her left breast was also swollen, which could be a sign of infection, the complaint sets out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It took nine days for Dr Salgado to respond to her texts, via the clinic. When he did, he prescribed her collagenase cream, according to the lawsuit, which is typically used to clean and remove dead tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Latimer texted pictures of her breasts to the clinic again in early November, showing an inflamed area around her nipples and areolas, which were completely black. On her right breast, the nipple was coming away, revealing puss underneath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She wrote: '[My breasts] feel tender on both sides. I noticed a profound indent on the right side.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The clinic did respond, and set up her meeting with Dr Salgado on November 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During this appointment, the doctor wrote in his notes, according to the lawsuit, that Latimer stated 'great satisfaction'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also wrote that both her nipples and areolas were 'compromised' and the implants 'may not be salvageable', and that he told her to go to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite this, Dr Salgado and the clinic are claimed to have said that Latimer was still 'progressing nicely'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The insurance sales assistant is pictured above with her dog. She said the loss of her nipples has left her struggling with intimacy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Latimer did not go to the hospital, but sent repeated text messages to her contact number at the clinic, according to the lawsuit, and received responses assuring her that her breasts were still 'progressing nicely'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her lawyers said she did not seek treatment from the hospital because she was continuously assured by Dr Salgado and his clinic that she was healing well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On November 17, she wrote: &lt;span&gt;'Hi any response from Dr Salgado yet?'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three days later, she texted again: 'Hi, any response from Dr Salgado on my progress from the photos I sent you on Thursday?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three hours later, the assistant replied: 'He says it's really progressing nicely.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At her next appointment with Dr Salgado on January 5, 2024, the doctor found, according to the lawsuit, t&lt;span&gt;hat she had completely lost her left nipple and partially lost the right nipple. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He prescribed Dakin's solution, a bleach solution that is used on dead tissue to stop bacterial growth. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On January 14, Latimer contacted the clinic to inform them that her left nipple had fallen off, that the left implant was exposed from her breast, and that her right nipple had also fallen off, causing a large indent in her right breast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She went to the hospital on January 17, also experiencing breast pain, foul smelling drainage from her breasts and swelling in the area, the lawsuit sets out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An image included in the complaint and allegedly taken the day after the surgery shows that Latimer's nipples have turned jet black&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was admitted to the hospital for IV antibiotics and two surgeries to remove her left and right implants and affected tissue. Doctors at the hospital noted a major infection, abscess and extensive tissue damage to the skin and breasts, according to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to the ordeal, Latimer said she now struggles with intimacy and said she had a regular pain in her left arm.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tiffany Troso-Sandoval, a breast cancer oncologist in New York who reviewed the case for this website, said: 'The patient is lucky to be alive actually, and very lucky that this did not progress to full-blown sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It needed to have been addressed much earlier than it was because the tissue was dying, and when she finally got to the ER there was a massive infection in both of her breasts.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing her case for the first time with DailyMail.com, she told this website: '&lt;span&gt;I’m grateful [to have] a voice to fight for accountability for what happened to me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’ve filed this lawsuit because I want to ensure that what I’ve gone through does not happen to anyone else ever again, and I’m hopeful that this will encourage others to have the courage to advocate for themselves and their health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 18:20:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQRXhrWVR4WmFpRkUwSHlwSG5Ja3NKRDlnMWhnWnowU19GUzhLdEpzVW0zZnhTUmZoc2JwX2RqazZWZkZNdDFJQ0tIQ3pRWGpNX0EyQks0bTA0dGluRWFfT1FKLXdUYllpemQwRHIyNzFBbW1ySE1TQkNiN3p4SmdzVmh2N3hlaG1kaGtsdFFTM0szbFhubzhiSUJOaFpnYmtkdGVfbWZaUV_SAa4BQVVfeXFMT2xYOWlGbENQTlRqaHA1Q215U3JvQnRLQlhFcUZtcnV6b3hKNW5Ua0p3aTlfWjg0WlhJMElMSFNILTdXOTNiV0ZzdUVqZVhDNUtoOHRhSnZseHA2a0hQQmZDOXJ2RUxRS3R2bFpmMHJhUUk1MUFVdGNscHo0UHRyeWZ6TnlOYk9NdTk4emNnWEstS1N0Wk4wc2Q1MlQ0SDBiVWVWV0V5NTlOb1g3TE9B</guid></item><item><title>情感依恋不安全的人更容易产生社交焦虑- PsyPost</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/people-with-insecure-affective-attachment-are-more-likely-to-be-socially-anxious/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A meta-analysis of studies investigating the association between affective attachment and social anxiety found that individuals with insecure attachment are more likely to experience social anxiety. The paper was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02654075251337887"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Social and Personal Relationships&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social anxiety is a mental health condition characterized by intense fear or worry about being judged, embarrassed, or negatively evaluated in social situations. It often develops during adolescence, when self-awareness and sensitivity to peer evaluation increase. Genetic predisposition, temperament traits such as shyness, and environmental factors like overprotective parenting or bullying can contribute to its onset. Early negative social experiences, such as humiliation or rejection, may also reinforce anxious responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing social anxiety is important because it can significantly impair education, career opportunities, and relationships. People with social anxiety may avoid speaking in class, meeting new people, or pursuing jobs that involve public interaction. If left untreated, it can lead to isolation, low self-esteem, and secondary problems such as depression or substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Yihan Zhang and colleagues sought to systematize the findings of prior research on affective attachment and social anxiety. Affective attachment refers to the deep emotional bonds individuals form with significant others. It develops early in life through interactions with caregivers, where consistent responsiveness fosters secure attachment and inconsistent or neglectful care can lead to insecure patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attachment patterns can be described using two psychological traits: attachment &lt;strong&gt;anxiety&lt;/strong&gt; (fear of rejection or abandonment) and &lt;strong&gt;avoidance&lt;/strong&gt; (discomfort with closeness and dependence). Individuals low on both traits are considered securely attached, while those with high levels of one or both are considered insecurely attached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers searched six scientific databases (ERIC, PsycINFO, PubMed, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, Scopus, and Web of Science) for studies containing attachment and social anxiety or social phobia as keywords. This search yielded 2,224 records. After excluding studies that did not meet inclusion criteria, 42 papers were retained for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, the included studies involved 21,332 participants, with mean ages ranging from 19 to 44 years. Gender distribution varied widely, with some studies including only one gender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighty percent of the studies reported a non-zero association between insecure attachment and social anxiety. On average, the strength of this association was in the low-to-medium range, though it varied considerably across studies. The association’s strength depended on the type of insecure attachment—whether characterized by high avoidance, high anxiety, or both—as well as on the method used to assess attachment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This meta-analysis confirmed that insecure attachment is significantly and positively related to social anxiety. Additionally, we found that the subcategory of insecure attachment and the instrument used to measure insecure attachment act as significant moderators that influence the association between insecure attachment and social anxiety,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the links between affective attachment pattern and social anxiety. However, it should be noted that this meta-analysis included only studies published in English. It is possible that including results published in other languages might have affected the overall results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02654075251337887"&gt;The relationship between insecure attachment and social anxiety in adult people: A three-level Meta-analysis,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Yihan Zhang, Yihui Wang, Lai Na Siu, and Juan Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 18:11:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOU2xIc0VSY1lYMlljT0RlSERNVzg3TFhiY1dKb1RfZHM3TjVVcUxEMG8xVURfLXdhU3Z5T1RCMU12WXowWWdMNGdtR2ljeWI4ZVZuZTJiNnAwRTdlWnh5ZWh5bGxuVmpxbVc1QzE2dlVSdHlzaXVFTEdsNGZRT1BKYldWQ0ZGVzVrQURTaFVDVUZvLTN6ZnBqcE0wem9jZnhHclBqZlFodzU</guid></item><item><title>心理时间旅行：患有“亢进症”的人会记住所有事情- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/mental-time-travel-a-teenager-with-hyperthymesia-remembers-too-much/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent case study describes a teenager who can summon personal memories with unusual speed, detail, and control – a very rare condition known as hyperthymesia. She can also use the same mental machinery to imagine future events with striking richness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists call this autobiographical &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/autobiographical-memory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;, the long term store of events from our own lives that includes &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/memory-isnt-only-stored-in-our-brains-other-cells-can-remember-too/"&gt;feelings&lt;/a&gt;, places, and people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive scientists also speak of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11752477/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;autonoetic consciousness&lt;/a&gt;, the reflective awareness that lets us mentally re-experience a past moment and place ourselves in a future one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hyperthymesia-autobiographical-memory"&gt;Hyperthymesia – autobiographical memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new paper is led by &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Valentina-La-Corte" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Valentina La Corte&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://u-paris.fr/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Paris Cité University&lt;/a&gt; and the Paris Brain Institute (&lt;a href="https://parisbraininstitute.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PBI&lt;/a&gt;). The phenomenon itself is rare, and a comprehensive &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11965258/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; notes that the literature is still small and methods vary across studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In these individuals, known as hyperthymesics, memories are carefully indexed by date. Some will be able to describe in detail what they did [on a specific date], and experience again the emotions and sensations of that day,” explained La Corte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case centers on TL (initials that do not correspond to her real name were given to preserve her anonymity), a 17 year old who does not just recall, she organizes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She reports fine grained control over access to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-prepares-the-brain-for-the-future-while-protecting-memories-of-the-past/"&gt;memories&lt;/a&gt; that many others with hyperthymesia do not describe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-she-organizes-memories"&gt;How she organizes memories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL distinguishes a factual store she calls black memory from the personal trove that matters to her sense of self. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She sorts that personal trove in an internal archive she calls the white room, where memories are arranged in binders by theme and date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She places hard experiences in containers to keep their emotional impact manageable, like a chest holding the death of a grandparent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also created adjacent rooms for anger, problems, and even a military room that appeared when her father left for service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mental layout seen in hyperthymesia cases is unusual because it blends chronology, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-and-inexpensive-supplement-prebiotic-fructooligosaccharides-protects-your-brain-from-dementia/"&gt;emotion&lt;/a&gt; regulation, and self narrative in one controllable space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reflects an effort to keep intrusive details in check without losing access to information that still matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-testing-hyperthymesia"&gt;Testing hyperthymesia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used established tools that probe memory for life events and the feeling of mentally traveling through time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of them, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19524095/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TEMPau&lt;/a&gt;, measures the sense of reliving across a person’s lifespan and separates richly lived episodes from facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also used the Temporal Extended Autobiographical Memory task (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022096513000398" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TEEAM&lt;/a&gt;) to extend the timeline and gauge how easily she can move across past and future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across tasks, TL produced unusually vivid, detailed reports and could shift perspective between first person and observer viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also considered accuracy. People with very strong autobiographical memory remain vulnerable to distortions, and prior &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1314373110" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that even highly superior autobiographical memory participants can form false memories under standard laboratory tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-hyperthymesia-matters"&gt;Why hyperthymesia matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case is not only about the past. Evidence shows that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-brains-use-storage-trick-to-keep-your-memories-in-sequential-order/"&gt;remembering&lt;/a&gt; and imagining recruit overlapping cognitive and neural systems, a point advanced by influential &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17700624/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When TL constructs rich scenes about tomorrow, she appears to harness the same machinery that helps her rebuild yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That overlap matters for everyday life. The ability to plan with concrete, sensory details is linked to better goal setting, clearer time estimates, and a stronger sense of identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also offers a window into clinical puzzles. If future thinking and remembering share processes, then changes that blunt rich recall may also weaken the ability to imagine next week in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across published work, highly superior autobiographical memory often involves fast, date anchored retrieval and abundant sensory detail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11965258/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; reports patterns of overactivation in autobiographical memory networks, including visual regions, during recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, structural brain differences are not consistent across cases. Functional connectivity differences sometimes appear, but anatomy alone does not explain the skill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-human-costs-and-benefits"&gt;Human costs and benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many reported cases carry emotional downsides because painful memories can flood awareness. TL’s approach is notable because she uses mental tools to tag and quarantine difficult episodes without erasing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That strategy raises practical questions for therapy and education. If people can be taught to structure personal memories with themes and timelines, perhaps they can gain clarity without amplifying distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also raises ethical questions. A mind that retrieves with this intensity may feel compelled to revisit moments that others allow to fade, which can complicate decision making and mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field still needs better tools to check the accuracy of distant life events against real dates and sources. It also needs longitudinal data to see whether abilities like TL’s change with age or with life transitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is difficult to generalize findings about hyperthymesia, since they rely on only a few cases,” concluded La Corte. The next wave of studies will need larger samples, tighter validation, and standardized tasks across labs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13554794.2025.2537950" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurocase&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 18:06:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNbmVaZC1NdnFCcEczekZoRFhHT0ZqZFlreWZPWWpibnkyYldHVExmeUFjRUJiazROZjVweGRQR0Z5Y21ndVo0YTZscUI2Y2xKRndNSnV1cEtPN0N5VEI2dFJxYVdmM3BoOEo2elZfLVdfMVZTc2JXcno5Q0hCcy1tYmF3NE81QXc0dy15T3ZDdHBhX1hJcnZ4ZUFvNA</guid></item><item><title>常见病毒可以帮助驱动帕金森氏症吗？ -神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/hpgv-virus-parkinsons-29646/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research suggests a previously harmless virus may be linked to Parkinson’s disease. Scientists detected Human Pegivirus (HPgV) in the brains and spinal fluid of Parkinson’s patients but not in controls, challenging assumptions that the virus is benign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings showed that patients with the virus had distinct immune responses and advanced brain changes, which were further influenced by genetic mutations like LRRK2. This discovery highlights a potential environmental factor in Parkinson’s development and opens new avenues for research into viral and genetic interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HPgV Discovery:&lt;/strong&gt; Found in 50% of Parkinson’s brains, none in controls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Interaction:&lt;/strong&gt; Virus presence altered immune system signals, influenced by genetics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Trigger:&lt;/strong&gt; Suggests viruses may interact with genes to contribute to Parkinson’s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New research from Northwestern Medicine finds that a usually harmless virus might be an environmental trigger or contributor to Parkinson’s disease, which affects more than one million people in the United States. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some cases are linked to genetics, most Parkinson’s cases are not, and the cause is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112575"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/npgv-virus-Parkinsons-neuroscince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/npgv-virus-Parkinsons-neuroscince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/npgv-virus-Parkinsons-neuroscince-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/npgv-virus-Parkinsons-neuroscince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/npgv-virus-Parkinsons-neuroscince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/npgv-virus-Parkinsons-neuroscince-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/npgv-virus-Parkinsons-neuroscince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/npgv-virus-Parkinsons-neuroscince.jpg" alt="This shows a brain surrounded by viruses and DNA." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/npgv-virus-Parkinsons-neuroscince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/npgv-virus-Parkinsons-neuroscince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/npgv-virus-Parkinsons-neuroscince-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/npgv-virus-Parkinsons-neuroscince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/npgv-virus-Parkinsons-neuroscince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/npgv-virus-Parkinsons-neuroscince-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/npgv-virus-Parkinsons-neuroscince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;They found HPgV in the post-mortem brains of five out of 10 people with Parkinson’s and none of the 14 control brains. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings were published in the latest issue of &lt;em&gt;JCI Insight&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to investigate potential environmental factors – such as viruses – that might contribute to Parkinson’s disease,” said Igor Koralnik, MD, chief of neuroinfectious diseases and global neurology at Northwestern Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using a tool called ‘ViroFind’, we analyzed post-mortem brain samples from individuals with Parkinson’s and from those who died of other causes. We searched for all known human-infecting viruses to identify any differences between the two groups.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northwestern Medicine researchers detected the Human Pegivirus (HPgV) in the brains of individuals with Parkinson’s disease, but not in those without it. While HPgV belongs to the same family as hepatitis C and is a blood-borne virus, it is not known to cause any disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“HPgV is a common, symptomless infection previously not known to frequently infect the brain,” Dr. Koralnik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find it in the brains of Parkinson’s patients at such high frequency and not in the controls. Even more unexpected was how the immune system responded differently, depending on a person’s genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests it could be an environmental factor that interacts with the body in ways we didn’t realize before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For a virus that was thought to be harmless, these findings suggest it may have important effects, in the context of Parkinson’s disease. It may influence how Parkinson’s develops, especially in people with certain genetic backgrounds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Koralnik and his team including post-doctoral fellow Barbara Hanson, PhD, studied post-mortem brains from 10 people with Parkinson’s and 14 without. They found HPgV in the post-mortem brains of five out of 10 people with Parkinson’s and none of the 14 control brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also present in the spinal fluid of Parkinson’s patients, but not in the control group. Individuals with HPgV in their brains exhibited more advanced or distinct neuropathological changes, including increased tau pathology and altered levels of certain brain proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the blood analysis, researchers used samples from over 1,000 participants in the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative, which was launched by The Michael J. Fox Foundation and scientists to create a robust biosample library to help speed scientific breakthroughs and new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the blood samples, we observed similar immune-related changes, mirroring those found in the brain,” Dr. Koralnik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who had the virus showed different signals from the immune system than those who didn’t, and this pattern was the same, no matter the genetics. But as we followed each person over time, we saw a more complicated picture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that in patients with a certain Parkinson’s-related gene mutation – LRRK2 – the signals from the immune system were different in response to the virus compared to Parkinson’s patients without the mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We plan to look more closely at how genes like LRRK2 affect the body’s response to other viral infections to figure out if this is a special effect of HPgV or a broader response to viruses,” added Dr. Koralnik.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the research team plans to study more people to find out how common the HPgV virus is in Parkinson’s patients and whether it plays a role in the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One big question we still need to answer is how often the virus gets into the brains of people with or without Parkinson’s,” said Dr. Koralnik.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also aim to understand how viruses and genes interact; insights that could reveal how Parkinson’s begins and could help guide future therapies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Parkinson’s Foundation, over one million people in the United States are living with Parkinson’s disease and 90,000 new cases are diagnosed every year.

All 14 age- and sex-matched controls were HPgV negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HPgV-brain positive patients with PD showed increased neuropathology by Braak stage and Complexin-2 levels, while those positive in the blood had higher IGF-1 and lower pS65-ubiquitin, supporting disruption in metabolism or mitophagy in response to HPgV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA-Seq revealed altered immune signaling in HPgV-infected PD samples, including consistent suppression of IL-4 signaling in both the brain and blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longitudinal analysis of blood samples showed a genotype-dependent viral response, with HPgV titers correlating directly with IL-4 signaling in a &lt;em&gt;LRRK2&lt;/em&gt; genotype–dependent manner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;YWHAB&lt;/em&gt; was a key hub gene in the &lt;em&gt;LRRK2&lt;/em&gt; genotypic response, which exhibited an altered relationship with immune-related factors, including &lt;em&gt;NFKB1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ITPR2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;LRRK2&lt;/em&gt; itself, in patients with PD who are positive for HPgV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest a role for HPgV in shaping PD pathology and highlight the complex interplay between viral infection, immunity, and neuropathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 17:19:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE45NC1pajUwV1BnNzR3a0pQWGZaQU1SR3hueVA1MkhkVkNBRm44N1JzcGhMMjcxTjUxcGhhWGxWLVIxVC1ob3EwQy1ocFV1MDY4UXlqdXltcml3SkwyaDVHLXJnZERRbEtW</guid></item><item><title>在研究中，与竞争对手礼来减肥药相比，诺和诺德的Wegovy将心脏病风险降低了57 ％ -路透社</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/novo-nordisks-wegovy-cuts-heart-risk-by-57-versus-rival-lilly-weight-loss-drug-2025-08-31/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 16:33:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi5AFBVV95cUxNYWVYZ1JaQnF1a3ZrTVlyaVRhNlQ2X2JqZ3hmQkFfeHdmUFpQOXNfSzNHa0dra0w3QjhVbWlJbmtVclF4TXNzQXJObUpIZUpRaHdtVFBlTE1EaDgwN1Fsc1Vxc0xtWDJlRDBwOWtMc1dCY3JsTUliaEN0a2N3emcxMTRGQU1ROFJILW5hV2hqYzNoZ0RiNzB2VEZUV1A1RmM4UFQ3WFc1VGVoajBwSXhpSDFWcU0weURYUGZXaUNJQS1kOUdGWUZaVTVUYUFkTnYxMTZZX3FmU2dBVHBnVzNDSjlnalQ</guid></item><item><title>这种不起眼的水果可以促进心脏健康-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/web-stories/this-humble-fruit-can-boost-heart-health/photostory/123617004.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;amp-story-grid-layer class="recircular" id="rcontent" template="vertical"&gt;&lt;div class="letterbox"&gt;&lt;p class="mid-heading"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You may also like&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc3 pa"&gt;9 foods that can protect the heart and p...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc5 pa"&gt;9 simple tips to lower blood pressure na...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/amp-story-grid-layer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>医生发现在预防心脏病发作方面比阿司匹林更好的药物-卫报</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/31/doctors-find-drug-that-is-better-than-aspirin-at-preventing-heart-attacks-clopidogrel</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Doctors have found a drug that is better than aspirin at preventing heart attacks and strokes, in a discovery that could transform health guidelines worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For decades, millions of people have been advised to take aspirin to reduce their risk of experiencing a serious cardiovascular event.

More than 300 million people live with CAD, including 2.3 million in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It occurs when arteries in the heart become narrowed by a buildup of atheroma, a fatty material within their walls. The pain or discomfort felt from such narrowing is called angina and if a blockage occurs, it can cause a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The findings challenge the longstanding recommendation of aspirin as the default treatment for preventing serious cardiovascular events in hundreds of millions of CAD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;CAD often requires lifelong treatment to prevent heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular death. Aspirin has traditionally been prescribed indefinitely for patients with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, the evidence supporting aspirin’s long-term benefits and safety has been limited. The new analysis of seven clinical trials found that patients taking clopidogrel had a 14% lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events – including heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death – compared with those taking aspirin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Importantly, the rates of major bleeding issues in patients were similar between the two drugs, dispelling concerns that clopidogrel might lead to more bleeding complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Writing in the Lancet, the study team said: “This comprehensive synthesis of available evidence indicates that, in patients with CAD, long-term clopidogrel monotherapy offers superior protection against major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events compared with aspirin, without an excess risk of bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="248e6beb-eebe-49f9-abb5-ad58936a34a3" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":14,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Potassium-rich diet may cut risk of heart failure by 24%, study suggests","elementId":"248e6beb-eebe-49f9-abb5-ad58936a34a3","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/29/potassium-rich-diet-may-cut-risk-of-heart-failure-by-24-per-cent-study"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The superior efficacy of clopidogrel v aspirin was consistent across multiple key subgroups, including individuals with clinical features predictive of poor clopidogrel responsiveness, supporting the generalisability of these findings to the broad spectrum of patients with CAD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“These results support a preference for clopidogrel over aspirin for chronic antiplatelet monotherapy for patients with stable CAD. The widespread availability, generic formulation and affordability of clopidogrel further supports its potential for extensive adoption in clinical practice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The analysis drew from diverse patient groups, including those who had undergone procedures such as stent placement or had experienced acute coronary syndrome, and examined various subgroups to ensure the findings applied broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Notably, even patients who might respond less well to clopidogrel as a result of genetic or clinical factors still benefited from its use over aspirin. The results suggest that clopidogrel should be considered the preferred long-term anti-platelet medication for patients with CAD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Because both medications are widely available, the findings have the potential to influence clinical guidelines worldwide and improve patient outcomes. Further research on the cost-effectiveness of clopidogrel, as well as broader population studies, will be needed to support changes in treatment standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Bryan Williams, the chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation, said: “Aspirin is a commonly prescribed drug to help prevent repeat heart attacks and strokes. This research suggests that clopidogrel, an alternative to aspirin, might be more effective at preventing recurrent heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Importantly, these benefits come without a greater risk of major bleeding. These findings are likely to impact the medications doctors prescribe to their patients to reduce their risk of future heart problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 16:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxPUFI0cGtua0d5VDlHal9MSF9VTFA5dHBtQTl4TUE4WTA1VF9sdkZIRHBMY3Q1ODZqU2pxYm9BanZ1ZkoweXRZNExyZ1BaZ3hKZDY0akFXbEJ0LXUxRVg2M1BxYk4tZGZudzMxYnFoUi1UQVQ1MVRiUTQ3ekY0UWxIZEcwY2RVU005TlhoYkNfX29iOHkzNFktWnJGMFM5WE5menhvVlYwWWFTZV9PcTI4MVhUR1Bad0RMYl9Qc1R2Q2QyMjNMVEdEZTU0aTVCZw</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家揭示自然降低胆固醇的最佳食物- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/cardiologists-reveal-best-foods-eat-140900723.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;15 Best Foods to Eat to Lower Cholesterol Naturally&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;MilosStankovic - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you think about cholesterol, do you automatically think "bad"?

So if you're looking for how to lower cholesterol naturally to avoid these conditions, you're making a smart choice for your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to remember, though, that your body does need &lt;em&gt;some &lt;/em&gt;cholesterol. Per the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23922-what-is-cholesterol" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, cholesterol is a waxy, fatty substance found in your cells. Your liver makes it naturally, but it’s also found in animal products like meat and dairy. Cholesterol is responsible for building cell membranes, helping your liver make bile, and assisting in the production of hormones. However, getting more than you need—which can happen from eating too many cholesterol-rich foods—causes plaque to form in the arteries, which &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ldlthebadcholesterol.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:could lead;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;could lead&lt;/a&gt; to dangerous blood flow blockages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="http://www.arkmedicalcenter.com/portfolio/omar-ali-md-facc/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Omar Ali, M.D., F.A.C.C.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Omar Ali, M.D., F.A.C.C.&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified interventional cardiologist at ARK Medical Center in Michigan; &lt;a href="https://www.columbiadoctors.org/jennifer-h-haythe-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jennifer Haythe, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jennifer Haythe, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of cardiology and director of the cardio-obstetrics program at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, discover what healthy cholesterol levels look like, plus the best expert-approved foods to lower cholesterol naturally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What do healthy cholesterol numbers look like?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two types of cholesterol in the body: LDL (or “bad”) cholesterol and HDL (or “good”) cholesterol. In general, you should limit LDL as much as you can, hopefully replacing it with HDL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LDL cholesterol is the main culprit behind buildup and blockage in the arteries, per the &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/cholesterollevelswhatyouneedtoknow.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Library of Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; (NLM), while HDL actually helps remove LDL. Cholesterol is measured in milligrams per deciliter of blood, abbreviated as mg/dL. Ideally, this is what healthy cholesterol numbers look like, according to the NLM:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women over age 20:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total cholesterol: 125 to 200 mg/dL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LDL cholesterol: Less than 100 mg/dL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;HDL cholesterol: 50 mg/dL or higher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Men over age 20:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total cholesterol: 125 to 200 mg/dL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LDL cholesterol: Less than 100 mg/dL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;HDL cholesterol: 40 mg/dL or higher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medications like statins can help you get to healthy levels, though most experts recommend trying to make healthy lifestyle changes first. “I always advise people to try and lower their cholesterol through diet and exercise,” said &lt;a href="https://www.columbiadoctors.org/jennifer-h-haythe-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jennifer Haythe, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jennifer Haythe, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of cardiology and director of the cardio-obstetrics program at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lowering your cholesterol without medication is possible, but it'll take some work. One of the most beneficial changes is simply getting more active. “To reduce cholesterol, it’s essential to start a cardiovascular fitness routine that involves moderately vigorous exercise four times per week,” Dr. Haythe said. You can start with moderate exercises, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/a20485587/benefits-from-walking-every-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:like walking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;like walking&lt;/a&gt;, for 15 to 20 minutes a day, building up from there. (And if you smoke, you should try to stop as soon as you can.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating a nutrient-rich diet is also crucial. Cutting back on high-cholesterol foods—like fried foods, sugary desserts, and fatty meats—is a start, but you should also eat more of the fare that can actually help lower your cholesterol. Fans of the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/diets/a30326160/mediterranean-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; should be pleased; its staples are naturally low in LDL cholesterol and can actively remove it from your system.

Because you digest fiber slowly, it’s able to bind to cholesterol in the blood and remove it from the body, Dr. Haythe explained.

Beta blockers have been the standard treatment for these patients for 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a breakthrough discovery from the “REBOOT Trial” with senior investigator Valentin Fuster, MD, PhD, President of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital and General Director of Spain’s Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC). The study results, which could overturn a standard treatment paradigm, were presented on Saturday, August 30, during a “Hot Line” session at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Madrid, and simultaneously published in &lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, a REBOOT substudy, published on August 30 in the &lt;em&gt;European Heart Journal,&lt;/em&gt; shows that women treated with beta blockers had a higher risk of death, heart attack, or hospitalization for heart failure compared to women not receiving the drug. Men did not have this increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This trial will reshape all international clinical guidelines. It joins other previous landmark trials led by CNIC and Mount Sinai—such as SECURE with the polypill and DapaTAVI, with SLT2 inhibition associated to TAVI—that have already transformed some global approaches to cardiovascular disease,” says Dr. Fuster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SECURE trial showed a polypill, a single pill that that combines three medications - which contains aspirin, ramipril, and atorvastatin – reduces cardiovascular events by 33 percent in patients treated with this after a heart attack. The DapaTAVI trial showed both dapagliflozin and the related medication empagliflozin - drugs used to treat diabetes- improves the prognosis of patients with aortic stenosis treated by transcatheter aortic valve implantation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“REBOOT will change clinical practice worldwide,” says Principal Investigator Borja Ibáñez, MD, CNIC’s Scientific Director, who presented the results. “Currently, more than 80 percent of patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction are discharged on beta blockers. The REBOOT findings represent one of the most significant advances in heart attack treatment in decades.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although generally considered safe, beta blockers can cause side effects such as fatigue, bradycardia (low heart rate), and sexual dysfunction. For more than 40 years, beta blockers have been prescribed as a standard treatment after a heart attack, but their benefit in the context of modern treatments was unproven. The REBOOT trial, is the largest clinical trial on this subject. The international study was coordinated by CNIC in collaboration with the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers enrolled 8,505 patients across 109 hospitals in Spain and Italy. Participants were randomly assigned to receive or not receive beta blockers after hospital discharge. All patients otherwise received the current standard of care and were followed for a median of nearly four years. The results showed no significant differences between the two groups in rates of death, recurrent heart attack, or hospitalization for heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A REBOOT subgroup analysis found that women treated with beta blockers experienced more adverse events. Results show women treated with beta-blockers had a 2.7 percent higher absolute risk of mortality compared to those not treated with beta-blockers during the 3.7 years of follow-up of the study. The elevated risk when treated with beta-blockers was restricted to women with a complete normal cardiac function after a heart attack (left ventricular ejection fraction of 50 percent or higher). Those with a mild deterioration in cardiac function did not have an excess risk of adverse outcomes when treated with beta-blockers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After a heart attack, patients are typically prescribed multiple medications, which can make adherence difficult,” explains Dr. Ibáñez. “Beta blockers were added to standard treatment early on because they significantly reduced mortality at the time. Their benefits were linked to reduced cardiac oxygen demand and arrhythmia prevention. But therapies have evolved. Today, occluded coronary arteries are reopened rapidly and systematically, drastically lowering the risk of serious complications such as arrhythmias. In this new context—where the extent of heart damage is smaller—the need for beta blockers is unclear. While we often test new drugs, it's much less common to rigorously question the continued need for older treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the motivation behind REBOOT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The trial was designed to optimize heart attack care based on solid scientific evidence and without commercial interests. These results will help streamline treatment, reduce side effects, and improve quality of life for thousands of patients every year,” Dr. Ibanez adds.&lt;/p&gt;

In recent years evidence has emerged suggesting they could prove to be lifesaving across a range of conditions beyond obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Now the results of new research presented at the European Society of Cardiology annual conference show weight loss drugs could reduce the risk of people with heart conditions being hospitalised or dying early by as much as 58%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the study, US researchers from Mass General Brigham, a nonprofit network of doctors and hospitals headquartered in Boston, analysed real-world data from more than 90,000 heart failure patients who were obese and had type 2 diabetes. All had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), the most common form of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The results showed that those taking semaglutide were 42% less likely to end up in hospital or die prematurely, compared with a proxy for placebo. In the same study, tirzepatide cut the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure or death from any cause by 58%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Globally, more than 60 million people have heart failure. Previous studies have suggested weight-loss drugs may improve heart failure symptoms, but their effect on important outcomes such as hospitalisation and death has never been evaluated in large populations until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The results presented in Madrid were simultaneously published in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study’s author Dr Nils Krüger, of Brigham and Women’s hospital and a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system, said: “Despite the widespread morbidity and mortality burden of HFpEF, current treatment options are limited. Both semaglutide and tirzepatide are well known for their effects on weight loss and blood sugar control, but our study suggests they may also offer substantial benefits to patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes by reducing adverse heart failure outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Our findings show that in the future, GLP-1 targeting medications could provide a much-needed treatment option for patients with heart failure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The findings add to evidence that weight loss drugs may help tackle or prevent heart conditions. In May, a trial found that people taking semaglutide had a 20% lower risk of heart attack, stroke or death due to cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/may/14/weight-loss-drug-semaglutide-reduce-heart-attack-risk-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;University College London study&lt;/a&gt; also found semaglutide brought about cardiovascular benefits, regardless of someone’s starting weight or the amount of weight that they had lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Carlos Aguiar, the vice-president of the European Society of Cardiology and a renowned expert in heart failure, who was not involved with the study, welcomed the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“What this shows is that there is a benefit in using one of these two agents, semaglutide or tirzepatide, to reduce the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure or all-cause mortality,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We thought that we actually might not really find a treatment that would work well for a significant proportion of these patients, and what’s been a good surprise is that these drugs that are working through weight loss, but possibly through other effects that go beyond weight loss, are potentially reducing the rates of hospitalisation and mortality in patients with heart failure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Aguiar, a cardiology consultant at Hospital Santa Cruz in Carnaxide, Portugal, said more evidence would be required before doctors could recommend rolling out weight loss drugs to heart patients specifically to cut their risk of adverse health outcomes, but the study results were “good news”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, a consultant cardiologist and clinical director of the British Heart Foundation, said: “These data add to the growing body of evidence supporting a role for weight loss drugs for patients living with both heart failure and obesity, to reduce hospital admissions and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s crucial that eligible heart failure patients have the opportunity to be considered for these therapies, alongside other evidence-based heart failure medicines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 14:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxOdWNFNFc2M0Y4bjJRMEtMbkJrNFdLemFNb1B6MVh5b3NPdWRUT2k1bHNmaDA5eXp0MXBTa3VsaXRycXZFN3pJMGlZcTA1Ql9oeUR3UV9EUmlWSk9EcUpxSy1nU0sxMFNseTNDZTJBOWJUcks2ZFpDZkR0OHpfRmRpRlQxc3hMcmN3ZWUzMFZmWWw5WjY2N3JfTnllTTlTemJqNGllWHAyUmlKMlNKMVNVemZwWFJfM0FCbmRKMVFmQQ</guid></item><item><title>神经病学家警告可能引发中风和痴呆症的流行运动后习惯-无聊的大熊猫</title><link>https://www.boredpanda.com/neurologist-issues-warning-about-popular-post-exercise-practice-it-could-trigger-a-stroke/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Visceral fat is a type of fat that’s &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-to-lose-visceral-fat-8703419" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;found deep within your abdomen&lt;/a&gt;, surrounding organs like the liver and intestines. Unlike subcutaneous fat, which is just beneath the skin, you can’t see visceral fat. But it causes all kinds of trouble for your health behind the scenes. That’s because this highly metabolically active fat releases harmful compounds into your bloodstream that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7902105/stress-causing-inflammation-what-you-can-do-about-it/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;increase inflammation throughout the body&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Spinach is high in lutein, zeaxanthin and beta carotene, which are members of a family of plant compounds called carotenoids.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Carotenoids are antioxidant compounds found in red, orange, yellow and some green vegetables,” says &lt;a href="https://www.anewwell.co/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Allison Knott, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “They help to fight inflammation and may play a role in combating fat accumulation.” Research has found that higher serum levels of carotenoids are associated with lower levels of visceral fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Carotenoid-rich veggies, like spinach, may be especially effective for reducing belly fat. For instance, one study of obese middle-aged men found that the more carotenoid-containing vegetables they ate, the less visceral fat they were likely to carry.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Spinach is also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15325/foods-that-do-the-weight-loss-work-for-you/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high in fiber and low in calories&lt;/a&gt;, which can promote fullness, helping you eat less overall. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cauliflower is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7676462/what-are-cruciferous-vegetables/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cruciferous vegetable&lt;/a&gt; that is filled with compounds called glucosinolates, says Jowett. When you eat cruciferous vegetables, the chewing process helps convert cauliflower’s glucosinolates to their active form, called sulforaphane. That’s a good thing because sulforaphane has been linked to reduced inflammation and improved insulin sensitivity, both of which may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-to-buy-if-you-want-to-lose-visceral-fat-8785221" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;protect against visceral fat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not a fan of cauliflower?

And one of those anti-inflammatory compounds is, you guessed it, sulforaphane. Broccoli is also a good source of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15696/is-fiber-good-for-weight-loss/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber, which can additionally help with weight loss&lt;/a&gt; by increasing satiety.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to their potent mix of anti-inflammatory compounds, Brussels sprouts are full of fiber. One cup of raw Brussels sprouts gives you 3 grams of fiber for fewer than 40 calories.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Artichokes are one of the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8059609/best-high-fiber-vegetables-to-eat-according-to-gastroenterologist/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;highest-fiber vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, helping to increase fullness and reduce overall calorie intake, says &lt;a href="https://melissamitri.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Melissa Mitri, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. Their fiber also helps support the growth of healthy gut bacteria, which play a role in weight management and fat loss, including visceral fat, she adds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One medium artichoke delivers an impressive 7 grams of fiber for just 65 calories.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This reddish purple vegetable is rich in potent antioxidants, called anthocyanins, which may help with fat-burning, says Jowett.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some research suggests anthocyanins may also help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/can-you-target-losing-visceral-fat-8760072" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;target visceral fat&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, one study found that people who reported consuming the most anthocyanin-rich foods had less visceral fat than people who ate few anthocyanin-containing foods. Researchers haven’t nailed down the mechanism just yet. However, they suspect that it may be related to anthocyanins’ ability to induce &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7918818/gut-health-and-weight-loss/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;favorable changes in gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; that help the body burn fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And if you like kimchi, you’ll be happy to hear that this fermented dish, made from napa cabbage, may also reduce visceral fat. “Kimchi is rich in naturally occurring probiotics, especially &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; strains, which are linked to reduced visceral adiposity," says &lt;a href="https://seekingthyme.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jessie Gutsue, M.A., RDN, IFNCP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, grab a jar of kimchi on your next grocery run. Or, if you’re feeling adventurous, make it yourself.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat More Fruit:&lt;/strong&gt; “According to recent research, U.S. adults who eat more fruits and vegetables tend to have less visceral fat,” says Mitri.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Their high fiber and water content provides bulk and keeps you full, making it easier to eat less to support fat loss, including the loss of visceral fat”. To boost your overall produce intake, try adding one serving of fruit or veggies to every meal or snack. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try Some HIIT Workouts&lt;/strong&gt;: All exercise does good things for your body. But if you want to burn belly fat, add some high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to your routine. “Several studies have shown that high-intensity interval training, which alternates between short bursts of intense activity and brief recovery periods, is more effective than resistance training for losing visceral fat,” says Mitri.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Stress: &lt;/strong&gt;Too much stress can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054352/6-fast-ways-to-lower-cortisol-levels/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;spike the stress hormone cortisol&lt;/a&gt;. And chronically high cortisol can drive the storage of belly fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Setting aside even a few minutes a day for a stress-relieving activity, such as meditation or deep-breathing relaxation exercises, is shown to lower cortisol levels and the stress response,” says Mitri.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Enough Sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; “Inadequate sleep is associated with higher amounts of visceral fat, possibly as a result of alterations in brain and hunger hormones,” says Mitri.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; She recommends aiming for seven to eight hours a night of sleep whenever possible. This is more achievable when you set stricter boundaries, turn off screens in the evening and implement a relaxing bedtime ritual, like taking a bath, meditating or reading, she says.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cut Back on Booze&lt;/strong&gt;: Alcohol is calorie-dense and can be high in added sugar. But that’s not the only way it may increase visceral fat, says Mitri. “Because it lowers your inhibitions, too much of it can lead to food choices that don’t align with your health goals and increase the risk of weight gain and visceral fat accumulation over time,” she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vegetables are a secret weapon for burning visceral fat. They’re rich in fiber, phytochemicals and antioxidants that work together to suppress appetite, improve gut bacteria diversity and reduce inflammation. While all vegetables can help you maintain a healthy body weight, dietitians say the best vegetables to reduce visceral fat are spinach, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, artichokes and cabbage. But if you want to step things up even more, add some HIIT workouts to your exercise routine. And don’t forget to make time to manage stress and get enough sleep—these may seem like luxuries, but research shows they can help reduce visceral fat, too.&lt;br&gt;

They were also asked about how satisfied they felt with their potential matches on dating apps, and how often they look around for new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the participants were asked whether they had ever been on date with someone from Tinder or a similar app, and whether they had had sex with someone from said apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the psychology experts found, roughly 31 percent of the participants, male and female alike, said they had gone on a Tinder date. Of the participants who reported having had sex with someone from a dating app — the percentage of which was not, unfortunately, listed — men were way more likely than women to do so, with 66 percent of that cohort being male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cross-referencing with the Dark Triad assessments, the researchers concluded that the men who had sex with people from the apps were more likely to score higher in unrestricted or openly-discussed sexual desire — no surprises there — but also, troublingly, in psychopathy. The same couldn't be said of men who didn't report having slept with app matches, nor of any women in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The women who said they'd had Tinder sex, meanwhile, reported much higher satisfaction with their decisions than the women who did not. The personality psychologists didn't determine exactly why those women felt so gratified by their app exploits, but they suggested that those women may have been more willing to accept flaws or mismatches in person, or that they felt an increased sense of sexual agency in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;PsyPost&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/psychopathic-men-and-less-selective-women-report-more-sex-via-tinder/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;about the study&lt;/a&gt;, Freyth drove home his surprise at learning that the women in his survey seemed to be "lowering their standards once on a date."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We consider this something like a sunk cost effect — after already texting, once on a date, the decision to engage further was already made," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Interestingly, it appears that Freyth and Jonason were also not surprised to find that men who hook up on dating apps &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/why-bad-looks-good/202008/which-dating-apps-appeal-to-dark-personalities" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;tend to be more psychopathic&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper's authors acknowledge that their study has its limitations, including that its self-reported responses could be skewed due to shame or self-aggrandizing. Still, Freyth boasted that the survey's age range made it more comprehensive than &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585323000138" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; which have &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02673843.2023.2241524" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;focused only&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11110432/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;younger people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Compared to most studies on dating apps," he told &lt;em&gt;PsyPost&lt;/em&gt;, "our sample was relatively old (the average age was around 40 years)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also the geographical component: how different would a study looking into the dating app experiences of 16-to-70-year-olds be if it were conducted in East Asia, or Latin America, or the United States? For now, we can only speculate — but we'd bet that there would be some fascinating takeaways for each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on sex:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/scientists-identify-sex-range" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientists Identify Ideal Amount of Boinking for Maximum Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 13:00:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE53Sy1NWlhZZkV0YVZrUGdRODZlZll1bnRnazFYc0JxSllVQUtWSVZsMnpMSGdWV19CUTlCdnJWVURHUGowbThUaUs5eW84ajE1Wmp0Q0QtSjdjTjluQzJwM3BmNGNRRDhT</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，人们的大脑结构与他们患重度抑郁症的遗传风险有关- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-08-people-brain-linked-genetic-major.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is among the most widespread psychiatric disorders, experienced by an estimated 3.8% of the global population. It is characterized by persistent low mood and a loss of interest in most activities, as well as possible disruptions in eating and sleeping habits.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The most severe and persistent form of depression, known as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/major+depression/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;major depression&lt;/a&gt; (MD), can be highly debilitating, often disrupting the lives of affected individuals and preventing them from working or engaging in other daily activities. Past studies suggest that depression is often caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genetic risk of developing depression or other mental health disorders is estimated using so-called polygenic risk scores (PRS). These are estimates of an individual's predisposition to a specific condition based on the cumulative effect of various genetic variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at University of Edinburgh, the University of Melbourne, Vrije University Amsterdam and other institutes recently carried out a large-scale study aimed at exploring the relationship between PRS values for MD and people's brain structure. Their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03136-4" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;, reports specific patterns in the volume and surface area of specific brain structures that are linked to a higher genetic risk for depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The neurobiological associations of genetic risk for MD remain under-explored in large samples, with no comprehensive mega-analysis conducted to date," wrote Xueyi Shen, Yara J. Toenders and their colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study analyzed data from 11 separate studies, encompassing 50,975 participants from the ENIGMA Major Depressive Disorder Working Group. We developed highly consistent genetic and neuroimaging protocols and applied these throughout all participating studies, together with rigorous genetic methods to remove overlap between the polygenic risk scores (PRS) training and testing samples."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;As part of their study, Shen, Toenders and their colleagues analyzed a large amount of genetic and neuroimaging data collected as part of 11 international studies. Based on this data, they calculated PRS values that estimated the genetic risk that the study participants would be diagnosed with MD at some point in their lives. Finally, they examined the brain scans collected from the participants and tried to determine whether higher PRS values were linked to specific patterns in the volume of various brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Elevated PRS for MD correlated with lower intracranial volume and lower global measure of cortical surface area," wrote the authors. "The most significant cortical association was observed in the surface area of the frontal lobe, particularly in the left medial orbito-frontal gyrus. In subcortical regions, lower volumes of the thalamus, hippocampus, and pallidum correlated with higher PRS of MD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the researchers found that the volume and surface area of intracranial and cortical regions were smaller in people with higher PRS values for depression than in those with lower values. The &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+areas/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain areas&lt;/a&gt; that appeared to be smaller in those who were genetically more likely to develop depression included the left medial orbitofrontal gyrus, the hippocampus, the thalamus and the pallidum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals under 25 years old also presented differences in the volume and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/surface+area/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;surface area&lt;/a&gt; of the same brain structures that were linked to the estimated PRS. While these differences were less pronounced than those observed in adults above 25, the patterns detected were the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Subsequent Mendelian randomization analysis revealed potentially causal effects of smaller left hippocampal volume on higher liability for MD," wrote the authors. "Our findings represent an example of how extensive international collaborations can significantly advance our neurogenetic understanding of MD and give insights to avenues for early interventions in those at high risk for developing MD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recent study sheds new light on the specific patterns in brain structure linked to a higher &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+risk/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic risk&lt;/a&gt; of facing MD. In the future, these insights could contribute to the development of new personalized therapeutic interventions for MD.&lt;/p&gt;

Long used for herbal medicines, the fungus has now been linked to cancer-fighting capabilities through a specific kind of sugar molecule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the National Taiwan University and National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in Taiwan discovered the link by focusing on a group of compounds produced by the fungus called sulfate polysaccharides (SPS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPS is a kind of sugar molecule known as a sulfated galactoglucan, which combines compounds of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"&gt;glucose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactose"&gt;galactose&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"&gt;sulfate&lt;/a&gt; into one molecule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/elusive-lsd-fungus-finally-discovered-on-flower"&gt;Elusive LSD Fungus Finally Discovered on Flower&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2023.124144"&gt;the fungus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.12.065"&gt;this class of molecule&lt;/a&gt; have previously been found to have anti- &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="171778" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and anti-inflammatory effects, but the exact mechanisms aren't yet fully understood.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/elusive-lsd-fungus-finally-discovered-on-flower"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A. cinnamomea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; can be grown in the lab, making its collection from the field unnecessary. &lt;/span&gt;To determine whether &lt;em&gt;A. cinnamomea's &lt;/em&gt;bioactive properties were the result of this one group of sugars, however, the researchers were forced to develop technology to encourage the fungus to produce SPS molecules in greater amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A particularly beneficial type of compound was identified: N50 F2. In experiments, it reduced key markers of inflammation in cells, as well as blocking and killing off &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-find-a-tiny-stomach-hidden-inside-lung-tumours-because-cancer-is-changing"&gt;lung cancer cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course, these findings need to be verified in living people and not just cultured cells, but the findings show promise for developing new therapies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The current study shows that &lt;em&gt;A. cinnamomea&lt;/em&gt; SPS has a strong anti-inflammatory effect and inhibits cancer cells in vitro," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2025.123810"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171781" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171781" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/CancerEffects.jpg" alt="Cancer effects diagram" class="wp-image-171781 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/CancerEffects.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/CancerEffects-600x125.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171781" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The N50 F2 molecule was shown to have the most effective anti-cancer impact on cells.

Polym.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery demonstrates the value in looking to the natural environment for sources of potential new cancer treatments. Studies have shown that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/plants-used-by-the-first-australians-show-benefits-for-cancer-treatment"&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tardigrade-protein-could-soon-make-cancer-patients-more-radiation-proof"&gt;tardigrades&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/amazonian-scorpion-venom-can-kill-breast-cancer-cells-scientists-say"&gt;scorpion venom&lt;/a&gt; can help tackle the disease, whether it's by attacking the cancer cells directly, stopping them from spreading, or enhancing existing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we can firmly add &lt;em&gt;A. cinnamomea&lt;/em&gt; to the growing list. There's still a lot of work to get this from the lab into actual usable treatments that can be safely prescribed, but the researchers succeeded in their aim of identifying molecules in this rare fungus that can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study demonstrates the potential of natural fungal compounds for pharmaceutical development," &lt;a href="https://www.asiaresearchnews.com/content/natural-fungal-polysaccharide-fights-both-cancer-and-inflammation"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; pharmaceutical scientist Chia-Chuan Chang, from the National Taiwan University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With a fully controlled production and extraction process, we are optimistic about future applications in both health supplements and clinical treatments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2025.123810"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carbohydrate Polymers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune-driven nerve fiber damage may underlie early smell loss in &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;Alzheimer’s&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Alzheimer&amp;amp;#039;s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects older adults, leading to memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. It is the most common cause of dementia. The disease is characterized by the buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain, which disrupt cell function and communication. There is currently no cure, and treatments focus on managing symptoms and improving quality of life.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/span&gt;, offering a new path for early diagnosis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A diminishing sense of smell can appear as one of the earliest indicators of Alzheimer’s disease, often emerging before noticeable cognitive decline. Researchers from DZNE and Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU) have uncovered new insights into this process, identifying a major role for the brain’s immune response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings suggest that immune activity mistakenly targets and destroys nerve fibers essential for odor perception. The study, reported in &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;Nature Communications&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;em&amp;amp;gt;Nature Communications&amp;amp;lt;/em&amp;amp;gt; is an open-access, multidisciplinary scientific journal that publishes significant advances across all areas of the natural sciences, including biology, physics, chemistry, and Earth science. It is part of the &amp;amp;lt;em&amp;amp;gt;Nature Portfolio&amp;amp;lt;/em&amp;amp;gt; and emphasizes rigorous peer review and broad accessibility.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, draws on data from both mice and humans, including brain tissue analyses and PET imaging. This knowledge could support strategies for earlier diagnosis and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team concluded that these smell-related impairments arise when microglia, the brain’s resident immune cells, strip away connections between two key regions: the olfactory bulb and the locus coeruleus. The olfactory bulb, situated in the forebrain, processes signals from the nose’s scent receptors. The locus coeruleus, part of the brainstem, influences this processing through long nerve fibers that extend into the olfactory bulb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The locus coeruleus regulates a variety of physiological mechanisms. These include, for example, cerebral blood flow, sleep-wake cycles, and sensory processing. The latter applies, in particular, also to the sense of smell,” explains Dr. Lars Paeger of DZNE and LMU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our study suggests that in early Alzheimer’s disease, changes occur in the nerve fibers linking the locus coeruleus to the olfactory bulb. These alterations signal to the microglia that affected fibers are defective or superfluous. Consequently, the microglia break them down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Alterations in the membrane&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lars Paeger and Prof. Dr. Jochen Herms, a co-author of the study, found clear evidence of altered membrane composition in the affected nerve fibers. They observed that phosphatidylserine, a fatty &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;acid&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;An acid is a chemical substance that releases hydrogen ions (H⁺) when dissolved in water, resulting in a low pH (below 7). Acids are often characterized by their sour taste and their ability to react with bases to form salts and water. They play essential roles in biology, industry, and environmental processes.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;acid&lt;/span&gt; normally located on the inner side of a neuron’s membrane, had shifted to the outer surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Presence of phosphatidylserine at the outer site of the cell membrane is known to be an ‘eat-me’ signal for microglia. In the olfactory bulb, this is usually associated with a process called synaptic pruning, which serves to remove unnecessary or dysfunctional neuronal connections,” Paeger explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In our situation, we assume that the shift in membrane composition is triggered by hyperactivity of the affected neurons due to Alzheimer’s disease. That is, these neurons exhibit abnormal firing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A wide range of data&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings of Paeger and colleagues are based on a plethora of observations. These include studies on mice with features of Alzheimer’s disease, analysis of brain samples from deceased Alzheimer’s patients, and positron emission tomography (PET) scans of the brains of individuals with Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Smell issues in Alzheimer’s disease and damage to the associated nerves have been discussed for some time. However, the causes were unclear until now. Now, our ﬁndings point to an immunological mechanism as cause for such dysfunctions – and, in particular, that such events already arise in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease,” says Joachim Herms, a research group leader at DZNE and LMU as well as a member of the Munich-based “SyNergy” Cluster of Excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Perspectives for early diagnosis&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So-called amyloid-beta antibodies have recently become available for the treatment of Alzheimer’s. For this novel therapy to be effective, it needs to be applied at an early stage of the disease, and this is precisely where the current research could be significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings could pave the way for the early identification of patients at risk of developing Alzheimer’s, enabling them to undergo comprehensive testing to confirm the diagnosis before cognitive problems arise. This would allow earlier intervention with amyloid-beta antibodies, increasing the probability of a positive response,” says Herms.&lt;/p&gt;

Hormone therapy, say experts in menopause, carries a host of benefits for women in perimenopause and menopause, from stopping hot flashes and night sweats to proffering long-term protection against heart disease. And the risks are either low or non-existent for most women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But less than 5% of women who are candidates for hormone therapy are on it — a lingering effect from the landmark Women’s Health Initiative study that cast doubt on the safety of hormone replacement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="A300" data-large-id="CONCERT1" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh300px lg:ais"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s still really out there in a way that’s causing a lot of misperceptions,” said Dr. Karen Adams, director of Stanford’s Program in Menopause and Healthy Aging and a professor in obstetrics and gynecology. “It has taken awhile for all of the data to kind of shake out. But the good news is that we know a lot more and it’s all pretty reassuring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of menopause are caused by plummeting levels of reproductive hormones when the ovaries stop working. Some symptoms, including hot flashes, can begin during perimenopause — a period of about eight years before menopause, during which the ovaries are “sputtering” like a car on its last legs and hormone levels can be wildly erratic, Adams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormone therapy involves giving the body a stream of enough hormones to alleviate symptoms and provide some long-term protection against conditions like osteoporosis and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before 2000, “everyone was on hormone therapy,” said Dr. Tami Rowen, a UCSF obstetrician and gynecologist, but the effects of the care were poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Women’s Health Initiative, launched in the early 1990s, was meant to look at the long-term health effects — protective or not — of hormone therapy for women. The study, though powerful in its size and scope, had a few design flaws that meant the results were poorly interpreted at first. In fact, the study was stopped early when it appeared as though women on hormone therapy were actually at increased risk of certain conditions, including heart attacks and breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh300px lg:ais"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that wasn’t the end of the story — and some scientists soon realized that the results were nuanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risks, it turned out, applied largely to women who started hormone therapy well after the onset of menopause, some in their 70s. Women who started hormone treatment in their 40s, 50s or 60s did well — in fact, they had lower rates of death from all causes than women not on hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormones are not appropriate for all women — in particular, women with a history of breast cancer, blood clots, and heart attack or stroke should talk to their doctor about the risks — but many more should probably be taking them, doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many doctors, even gynecologists, still don’t know how best to prescribe the therapy or have retained faulty information about it left over from the Women’s Health Initiative, said Rowen. That means women may have to be proactive about their care as their reproductive system winds down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s no reason to suffer symptoms that are extremely treatable, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a quality of life issue,” said Rowen. “If symptoms are disruptive to your life, seek care and don’t accept that there’s nothing we can do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormone therapy  — such as this low-dose estrogen skin patch — involves giving the body a stream of enough hormones to alleviate symptoms and provide some long-term protection against conditions like osteoporosis and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Associated Press&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What hormones do — and don’t — treat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, though hormones developed something of a bad rap after the Women’s Health Initiative, social media influencers have somewhat recently become proponents — and some of them are pitching hormone therapy as a sort of magic pill, said Dr. Brigid Norton, an obstetrician and gynecologist with Kaiser in San Rafael.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormones are not a panacea. They’re not going to alleviate the achy joints and extra pounds almost everyone gets in their 40s and up, and they’re not going to solve the anxiety and depression that can tag along with middle-aged responsibilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have a frozen shoulder and an estrogen patch on,” said Norton with a laugh, referring to her own hormone therapy and lingering aches and pains. “You can’t discount 50 years of wear and tear on your body, and hormones are not going to fix that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The therapy primarily will help with hot flashes, which roughly 80% of women will experience in menopause, night sweats and vaginal dryness. They’re not meant to treat mental health issues like depression and anxiety that can creep up with menopause, though some women say the hormones help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When to start&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The right time to start hormone therapy will be different for every woman, and not all women may choose the therapy. Indeed, some women breeze through menopause, Rowen said, though that’s not the norm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though it’s possible to check hormone levels, doctors generally don’t use those tests to diagnose menopause or consider treatment options; during perimenopause hormones are too unstable to test reliably, and after menopause there’s no point to determining the levels because everyone will have very low or nonexistent estrogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="S300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women should reach out for care as soon as they experience symptoms that bother them. For women in perimenopause, that most likely is unpredictable periods and mood swings or brain fogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menopause officially begins when a woman hasn’t had a period for a year. That’s another time when women should talk to a doctor about the potential benefits of hormone therapy, either to treat symptoms or to get long-term protective benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women also can start hormones later in their menopause journey as symptoms arise and become problematic. Generally any time within 10 years of the start of menopause is fine for starting hormone therapy. Outside that window, the risks start to become more pronounced and women will want to talk with a provider about their options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, I see people who are 73 who are wanting to start hormones because they’re hearing good things about it, and it’s a shame it’s so late,” Adams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What kind of hormones?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormone therapy is largely about replacing estrogen that the ovaries stop producing as the reproductive years end. Women with a uterus generally get a combination of estrogen and progestin to protect against uterine cancer, and women without a uterus get estrogen alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women in perimenopause may benefit most from birth control, which can help keep their periods reliable and easier to manage. They don’t necessarily benefit from other types of hormone therapy, though, because their system is too chaotic — giving them a steady stream of low-dose estrogen won’t control their periods and probably won’t address any other symptoms, said Norton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once women are in menopause, most will be prescribed hormone patches that they change weekly, combined with a progestin pill taken daily. Women who experience vaginal dryness specifically may want to ask their doctor about a vaginal ring to supply estrogen to the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stopping hormone therapy is also a personal choice that should be made with a doctor. Many women are advised to go off it around age 65, but there’s no set rule. “I have 80-year-olds who would stab me if I had to take them off their hormones,” Norton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norton noted that the science around menopause treatment and hormone therapy is still evolving, and what doctors advise now may change in a few years, so women should keep checking in with their providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the state of affairs at this moment in time,” Norton said. “But it’s super important that you’re touching base with your provider every one to two years so we can talk about what the newest data say. It’s an ongoing conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>San Francisco Chronicle</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 11:13:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOVnJFQU5zY1VDYVRKbHkyaVlhZ3NrUy1vSTZuV2lDS0NmU3dsZFkxMkhxNDJmeC14WDBabmx5bFFMV3B4NmtNS1RFdW14MHZ6SXFuZ0lzLTJGeUNCeFlzVHpYQnBORGUxR3YtSTFTQmVWay1VUmtJdVNtRlFJSFZGclNUTmo5dXN4YWpHMHNfcUY1dGg1VEJXaHJVUVI2Y1dvWjVTNkRn</guid></item><item><title>甜菜汁在短短两周内秘密帮助老年人降低血压- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250831010505.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;The blood pressure lowering effect of nitrate-rich beetroot juice in older people may be due to specific changes in their oral microbiome, according to the largest study of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Exeter conducted the study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Free Radical Biology and Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, comparing responses between a group of older adults to that of younger adults. Previous research has shown that a high nitrate diet can reduce blood pressure, which can help reduce risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrate is crucial to the body and is consumed as a natural part of a vegetable-rich diet.  When the older adults drank a concentrated beetroot juice ‘shot’ twice a day for two weeks*, their blood pressure decreased – an effect not seen in the younger group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study, funded by a BBSRC Industrial Partnership Award, provides evidence that this outcome was likely caused by the suppression of potentially harmful bacteria in the mouth.  An imbalance between beneficial and harmful oral bacteria can decrease the conversion of nitrate (abundant in vegetable-rich diets) to nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is key to healthy functioning of the blood vessels, and therefore the regulation of blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study author Professor Anni Vanhatalo, of the University of Exeter, said: “We know that a nitrate-rich diet has health benefits, and older people produce less of their own nitric oxide as they age. They also tend to have higher blood pressure, which can be linked to cardiovascular complications like heart attack and stroke. Encouraging older adults to consume more nitrate-rich vegetables could have significant long term health benefits. The good news is that if you don’t like beetroot, there are many nitrate-rich alternatives like spinach, rocket, fennel, celery and kale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study recruited 39 adults aged under 30, and 36 adults in their 60s and 70s through the NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility. The trial was supported by the Exeter Clinical Trials Unit. Each group spent two weeks taking regular doses of nitrate-rich beetroot juice and two weeks on a placebo version of the juice with nitrate stripped out. Each condition had a two week “wash out” period in between to reset. The team then used a bacterial gene sequencing method to analyse which bacteria were present in the mouth before and after each condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both groups, the make-up of the oral microbiome changed significantly after drinking the nitrate-rich beetroot juice, but these changes differed between the younger and older age groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The older age group experienced a notable decrease in the mouth bacteria &lt;em&gt;Prevotella &lt;/em&gt;after drinking the nitrate rich juice, and an increase in the growth of bacteria known to benefit health such as &lt;em&gt;Neisseria&lt;/em&gt;. The older group had higher average blood pressure at the start of the study, which fell after taking the nitrate-rich beetroot juice, but not after taking the placebo supplement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-author Professor Andy Jones, of the University of Exeter, said: “This study shows that nitrate-rich foods alter the oral microbiome in a way that could result in less  inflammation, as well as a lowering of blood pressure in older people. This paves the way for larger studies to explore the influence of lifestyle factors and biological sex in how people respond to dietary nitrate supplementation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Lee Beniston FRSB, Associate Director for Industry Partnerships and Collaborative Research and Development at BBSRC, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This research is a great example of how bioscience can help us better understand the complex links between diet, the microbiome and healthy ageing. By uncovering how dietary nitrate affects oral bacteria and blood pressure in older adults, the study opens up new opportunities for improving vascular health through nutrition. BBSRC is proud to have supported this innovative partnership between academic researchers and industry to advance knowledge with real-world benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is titled ‘Ageing modifies the oral microbiome, nitric oxide bioavailability and vascular responses to dietary nitrate supplementation’ and is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Free Radical Biology and Medicine. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Half were trained in six sessions to walk with their feet angled – between five to ten degrees inwards or outwards – while the other half were told to continue walking naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results, published in The Lancet last week, showed that the group who changed how they walked reported half as much pain as the other group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The walking style lessened pressure in the knee by up to four per cent. The researchers say it is the first study to show that walking technique can help manage osteoarthritis symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around ten million people in the UK have osteoarthritis, where the protective cartilage in a joint breaks down, leaving bone rubbing on bone and causing pain and problems moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is estimated that just over half of those patients have it in their knee – with 100,000 a year having a knee replacement operation on the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;US researchers have discovered that the change was as effective as over-the-counter painkillers in relieving symptoms of osteoarthritis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say teaching the new walking technique could delay a number of these surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors note that the earlier patients receive a replacement knee, the more likely they are to need future procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Although our results have to be confirmed in future studies, they raise the possibility that the new, non-invasive treatment could help delay surgery,’ said study co-lead author Dr Valentina Mazzoli, professor of radiology at New York University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘These results highlight the importance of personalising treatment instead of a one-size-fits-all approach to osteoarthritis.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;We may be a few years out from the COVID-19 pandemic, but similar to influenza, each season brings a new strain of the respiratory infection—some of which are stronger and more contagious than others. In fact, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/covid-vascular-aging/" target="_blank"&gt;COVID&lt;/a&gt; levels are surging in 11 states (and “growing” in 36 states) right now, as omicron subvariants Nimbus and “Stratus” continue to spread.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;i&gt;Best Life&lt;/i&gt; previously explained, “&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/razor-blade-throat-nb181-covid-spread/" target="_blank"&gt;Nimbus (B. 1.8.1)&lt;/a&gt; accounted for nearly 50 percent of COVID cases in June, while XFG or “Stratus” picked up speed in July. Stratus is a mix of two earlier strains: LF.7 and LP.8.1.2. It’s considered the more serious of the two because of how rapidly it’s spreading across the country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="htlad-mob-square-fixed first_ad karma_unit inline hide-desktop"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says COVID is an imminent threat heading into the fall, when cases of the common cold and flu are historically high. As a matter of fact, the agency “just reported &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" title="CDC: COVID Data Tracker" href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#maps_positivity-week" target="_blank" data-citation="true"&gt;a 10 percent increase&lt;/a&gt; in test positivity rates, and COVID-related emergency room visits are also up 15.2 percent from the week prior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are things you can do to reduce your COVID risk, such as wearing a mask and staying up-to-date on your SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Furthermore, you might find protection from COVID-19 through the common cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a new study published in &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" title="The Journal of Infectious Diseases: The Common Cold Is Associated With Protection From SARS-CoV-2 Infections" href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaf374/8230147?login=false" target="_blank" data-citation="true"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Journal of Infectious Diseases&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, individuals, particularly children, are at lower risk of catching COVID after a bout with the common cold. That’s because, as scientists theorize, rhinovirus infections (the typical cause of the common cold) seemingly prep the body to better defend itself against SARS-Co-V-2 infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that the immune boost from a recent cold may give the body an early advantage in fighting SARS-CoV-2 before it has a chance to take hold,” senior study author &lt;strong&gt;Max Seibold&lt;/strong&gt;, PhD, a researcher and director of the Regenerative Medicine and Genome Editing Program (REGEN) at National Jewish Health, said in &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.nationaljewish.org/about-us/news/press-releases/2025-news/common-cold-may-protect-against-covid-19" target="_blank"&gt;a news release&lt;/a&gt;. “This may help explain why children, who tend to get more colds than adults, generally experience fewer and less severe COVID cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To arrive at their findings, the team tested 10,493 nasal swabs for 21 respiratory pathogens—including rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2 infections—from 4,100 people in 1,394 households. These were collected from May 2020 to Feb. 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results showed that patients who had contracted a rhinovirus infection in the last 30 days were &lt;strong&gt;48 percent less likely&lt;/strong&gt; to test positive for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, children had higher “baseline expression levels of interferons.” These are naturally occurring agents &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" title="Cleveland Clinic: Interferons" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/interferons" target="_blank" data-citation="true"&gt;that fight infections&lt;/a&gt; and diseases from infiltrating your immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They got their name because they ‘interfere’ with viruses and other germs and prevent them from multiplying,” explains Cleveland Clinic. As you might be able to surmise, more interferons means a better chance at staving off diseases, like COVID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Based on these findings, we hypothesize that interferons induced by prior viral respiratory infections may prime the airways of children with high levels of antiviral defense proteins, resulting in reduced levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection and better clinical outcomes compared to adults,” the authors wrote in the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, lead author &lt;strong&gt;Camille Moore&lt;/strong&gt;, PhD, warned that this “doesn’t mean people should intentionally try to catch a cold.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Understanding how one virus can affect the body’s response to another could help us develop new prevention strategies, especially for vulnerable populations,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;

The results were presented at &lt;a href="/topic/madrid"&gt;Madrid’s&lt;/a&gt; European Society of Cardiology congress, the world’s largest heart conference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Bundgaard said: “With a broader view we can say that higher dietary intake of potassium may not only benefit patients with heart disease but probably all of us, so maybe we should all reduce sodium and increase potassium content in our food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, &lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/blood-pressure-banana-lower-salt-b2736276.html"&gt;a study published in the American Journal of Physiology-Renal Physiology&lt;/a&gt; found that eating more potassium can also lower blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anita Layton, one of the study’s authors, said: “Our research suggests that adding more potassium-rich foods to your diet such as bananas or broccoli might have a greater positive impact on your blood pressure than just cutting sodium.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 09:23:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOMkFUNXJqaER3SFl2b2l0dmlpTjZNaVB0VnR1UDk4aTJhT0IzcHlsXzVOcEZWbVB6M0dWd3dkeDNQNEI1bEQxcUhoYzZjTWdRX2pIUjlPNWxMcnMzUXBfakVlazhhUGJRRjZBZ1ZDWE41bVE1QThsOUNRYVdhQURLeDhGQ3I3T0o4V3hRYml1MDAtc1dWWElYbUNB</guid></item><item><title>从诊断到哑铃：举重如何帮助癌症患者- TribLIVE.com</title><link>https://triblive.com/local/valley-news-dispatch/from-diagnosis-to-dumbbells-how-weightlifting-is-helping-cancer-patients/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;

Try balancing on one leg with your knee lifted to hip height and hold for a few seconds before switching sides, then repeat five times per leg. You can gradually work up to 30 seconds per side before making the whole thing more challenging by standing on an unstable surface (such as a Bosu ball).

Not so, oral health experts tell &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/your-body/oral-health/articles/leading-dental-experts-youre-probably-100000624.html" data-ylk="slk:NBC News;cpos:19;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;. It’s best to use a pea-sized amount of toothpaste rather than a hefty glob. “Toothpastes have surfactants — a detergent — which makes your teeth feel smooth, so you have an almost immediate sensation that you’ve cleaned your teeth when probably you haven’t done a good job,” dentist Fridus van der Weijden says. Plus, all that foam could mask bleeding gums, which can &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/gum-disease-182410970.html" data-ylk="slk:indicate issues like gingivitis;cpos:20;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;indicate issues like gingivitis&lt;/a&gt;, Lancette VanGuilder, president of the American Dental Hygienists’ Association, notes. Another tip? Use an electric toothbrush with soft bristles, and make sure you clean your pearly whites for two minutes at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/shower" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🚿;cpos:21;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🚿&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Take a warm shower at night&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you start the day with a shower but want the best snooze possible at night, consider flipping your routine, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/sleep/articles/nighttime-routine-backwards-experts-10-132900571.html" data-ylk="slk:Women’s Health;cpos:22;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Women’s Health&lt;/a&gt; reports. Research shows that a warm shower, ideally one to two hours before bed, reduces the time it takes to fall asleep. The reason? Showering in warm water forces your body to cool itself down, which sends signals to your brain that it’s time to relax and unwind. Taking a warm bath at night has also been shown to improve sleep, so hit the tub before bed if that’s your preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/olive" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🫒;cpos:23;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🫒&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Move it … and go Mediterranean&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Combining healthy eating with movement is a powerful way to prevent diabetes, a new study says.

The Mediterranean diet focuses on consuming vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, beans and olive oil while limiting red meat and processed foods. Need some meal inspo?

Spending time in nature may help restore your attention span and stop your brain from getting fatigued, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:31;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/easiest-way-restore-attention-span-100000807.html" data-ylk="slk:the Los Angeles Times;cpos:31;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;the Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt; reports. The tip comes from environmental neuroscientist Marc G. Berman, who found via lab research that there are cognitive benefits to spending just 15 to 20 minutes in nature. The theory is that nature provides an environment that is “softly fascinating”; you’re able to stare at a waterfall and enjoy it while also having other thoughts, which keeps your brain engaged without exhausting it. So next time you’re tempted to plop on the couch for an endless social media scroll, consider going out for a walk instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:32;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/carrot" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🥕;cpos:32;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🥕&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pick vitamin A-rich foods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vitamin A is an essential nutrient that helps keep our vision sharp and our immune system functioning — and since our bodies don’t produce it on their own, it’s crucial to get it from food. &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:33;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/nutrition/healthy-eating/articles/could-vitamin-secret-better-health-142100298.html" data-ylk="slk:Prevention;cpos:33;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Prevention&lt;/a&gt; recommends loading up on vitamin A-rich produce, such as carrots, sweet potatoes, apricots, kale and broccoli. Another option? Pick salmon as your protein source: Just 3.5 ounces of the fish contains 8% of the daily recommendation for vitamin A, dietitian Joanna Gregg notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:34;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/person-in-lotus-position" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🧘;cpos:34;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🧘&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Do high-intensity yoga for the best sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Exercise can help you sleep better, but new research says that one type is best. As &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:35;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/sleep/articles/exercise-best-night-sleep-according-081740281.html" data-ylk="slk:the Independent;cpos:35;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;the Independent&lt;/a&gt; reports, scientists from Harbin Sport University in China found that doing high-intensity yoga twice a week for at least 30 minutes per session offered the most sleep improvement when compared with other forms of movement like&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:36;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/should-you-take-up-tai-chi-experts-explain-the-benefits-and-how-to-get-started-080017397.html" data-ylk="slk:tai chi;cpos:36;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt; tai chi&lt;/a&gt; and walking. One potential reason is that yoga activates the parasympathetic nervous system, where our body rests and digests, but more research needs to be done. Still, if you’re regularly struggling to get quality shut-eye, try popping into a vinyasa flow class.

But not all magnesium is the same, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:39;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/nutrition/vitamins-supplements/articles/could-magnesium-key-better-health-141500770.html" data-ylk="slk:Prevention;cpos:39;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Prevention&lt;/a&gt; reports. In fact, there are many different supplements on the market that aid with different things. For example, magnesium glycinate is good for improving sleep, magnesium citrate helps with constipation and magnesium L-threonate supports brain health. Because supplements aren’t as tightly regulated as medications and can interact with other drugs, it’s best to talk with your doctor about which type and dose is right for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One simple way to ensure you’re getting plenty of magnesium is to pick foods rich in the mineral: Leafy greens, nuts, seeds and whole grains are all excellent magnesium sources. In the mood for something sweet? Pick dark chocolate — you’ll get dessert with a dose of magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 09:00:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAJBVV95cUxOMlBabXdNOUFlNnRiWFFQUTdyTUdiSkRYQS1DX2hfT2hESlFFWG5oNkxhV2VwME9fTm9IUUFVdFQ0Ym0xMEdDM3JHYVNSWktKUXMtZlZTOENqNHVkM0sydVFKMEduS3NHd09TbDQ1SE9nLTdMUldBZXJrREVkb1NSSFkxTGROVTdNdUdqZ2Nmam82cG50NzlIV1pYTHVjUEh5MWpnQ1Z4N2hfZG1hV3NhNU9fWmJvVng4NTF5Z0JvamdSMFEyT3NZeTFyd2dGa21KSUFEZkp3TFM5dnh5eGQyYmpDZkdKVDRvMW44azRfVmhtcGEzUUtDMGI2LVo1WVRvWFpPX0hDOEE</guid></item><item><title>像Ozempic和Mounjaro这样的减肥刺拳可以让心力衰竭患者远离医院-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15051557/Weight-loss-jabs-Ozempic-Mounjaro-heart-failure-patients-hospital.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-4622ec30-8643-11f0-8460-3121a964a5f7"&gt;Weight loss&lt;/a&gt; jabs can slash the risk of heart patients dying or being admitted to hospital by more than half, the largest study of its kind suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said millions more patients could soon be offered the likes of Mounjaro and Wegovy to extend their life as they hailed their 'dramatic benefits'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drugs, known as GLP-1 agonists, were initially developed to treat &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-461fb7e0-8643-11f0-8460-3121a964a5f7"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and work by mimicking a hormone to make users feel full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But mounting evidence has emerged in recent years to suggested they could prove to be lifesaving across a range of conditions beyond diabetes and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now new research shows they could reduce the risk of people with heart conditions being hospitalised or dying early by as much as 58 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;American researchers from Mass General Brigham, a nonprofit network of doctors and hospitals headquartered in Boston, analysed real-world data from more than 90,000 heart failure patients who were obese and had type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HfpEF), the most common form of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results showed that those taking the weight loss drug semaglutide - commonly sold under the brand names Ozempic and Wegovy - were 42 per cent less likely to end up in hospital or die prematurely, compared to a proxy for placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Weight loss jabs can slash the risk of heart patients dying or being admitted to hospital by more than half, according to a study &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Now new research shows they could reduce the risk of people with heart conditions being hospitalised or dying early by as much as 58 per cent (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, the weight loss drug tirzepatide - sold as Mounjaro - cut the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure or death from any cause by 58 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Globally, more than 60 million people have heart failure, with around 1million living in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous studies have suggested that weight loss drugs may improve heart failure symptoms, but their effect on important outcomes like hospitalisation and death has never been evaluated in large populations until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By analysing real-world data from such a large group of patients, the researchers demonstrated that GLP-1 agonists may significantly reduce the risk of hospitalisation due to heart failure and all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings were simultaneously presented at the European Society of Cardiology congress in Madrid and published in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Study author Dr Nils Krüger, of Brigham and Women's Hospital, said his study demonstrated fat jabs have 'dramatic benefits' for patients with heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Despite the widespread morbidity and mortality burden of HFpEF, current treatment options are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Both semaglutide and tirzepatide are well-known for their effects on weight loss and blood sugar control, but our study suggests they may also offer substantial benefits to patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes by reducing adverse heart failure outcomes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite promising results from previous studies of semaglutide and tirzepatide, regulators have not yet approved or endorsed the use of these drugs for HfpEF patients, due in part to the studies' relatively small sample sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the new study, researchers used data from three large US insurance claims databases to emulate two previous, placebo-controlled trials of semaglutide and tirzepatide in new populations that were an average of 19 times larger than those previously evaluated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They compared the one-year risk of hospitalisation or death in new users of each weight loss drug to the risk of those outcomes in a placebo group of patients taking sitagliptin, a diabetes drug known to have no impact on HfpEF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Krüger said: 'By using nationwide data and an innovative methodological approach, our team was able to expand the findings of previous trials to larger populations more representative of HFpEF patients treated in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our findings show that in the future, GLP-1 targeting medications could provide a much-needed treatment option for patients with heart failure.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In May, a trial found that people taking semaglutide had a 20 per cent lower risk of heart attack, stroke or death due to cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The University College London study also found semaglutide brought about cardiovascular benefits, regardless of someone's starting weight or the amount of weight that they had lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Carlos Aguiar, vice-president of the European Society of Cardiology and a world renowned expert in heart failure, who was not involved with the study, welcomed the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'What this shows is that there is a benefit in using one of these two agents, semaglutide or tirzepatide, to reduce the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure or all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We thought that we actually might not really find a treatment that would work well for a significant proportion of these patients, and what's been a good surprise is that these drugs that are working through weight loss, but possibly through other effects that go beyond weight loss, are potentially reducing the rates of hospitalisation and mortality in patients with heart failure.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Aguiar, a cardiology consultant at Hospital Santa Cruz in Carnaxide, Portugal, said more evidence would be required before doctors could recommend rolling out weight loss drugs to heart patients specifically to cut their risk of adverse health outcomes, but the study results were 'good news'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, clinical director at the British Heart Foundation and consultant cardiologist, said: 'These data add to the growing body of evidence supporting a role for weight loss drugs for patients living with both heart failure and obesity, to reduce hospital admissions and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's crucial that eligible heart failure patients have the opportunity to be considered for these therapies, alongside other evidence-based heart failure medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you have been prescribed these medicines by your doctor, there are steps you can take to maintain the benefits long into the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This includes adding more regular exercise, including some resistance training, into your routine and working towards as healthy and nutritious diet as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But these drugs don't suit everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's important to seek medical advice if you are anxious about side effects, or if you experience sudden and severe pain in your abdomen while using weight loss drugs.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 08:32:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Novo的Wegovy在现实世界的心脏病研究中击败了礼来的Zepbound -寻求阿尔法</title><link>https://seekingalpha.com/news/4490637-novos-wegovy-beats-lillys-zepbound-heart-diseases</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sa-content-offsets"&gt;&lt;div class="paywall-full-content R6FbO mb-32 flex sa-text-content sa-media-content sa-table-content sa-content-helpers print:block"&gt;&lt;div class="w-0 grow print:w-auto"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="T2G6W" data-test-id="content-container"&gt;&lt;figure class="getty-figure" contenteditable="false" data-show-to-all="false" data-type="getty-image"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1219304819/image_1219304819.jpg?io=getty-c-w750" sizes="(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

&lt;p id="438fbb48-8ac4-44d0-966c-c47a395636dc"&gt;Gone are the days when gym sessions were just about changing the way you look. More and more people are now aware that exercise is one of the most effective things you can do for your long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rachael Sacerdoti, a personal trainer and founder of the coaching platform &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/itssosimple_rs/?hl=en" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/itssosimple_rs/?hl=en" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;It's So Simple&lt;/a&gt; is an advocate for adopting strength training if you want to age well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="438fbb48-8ac4-44d0-966c-c47a395636dc-2"&gt;"If someone has a good muscle base, they're increasing their quality of life and longevity," she tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to weights and feeling apprehensive at the thought of getting started, Sacerdoti suggests beginning with one simple, versatile move: the lunge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Doing any form of lunge will hit your glutes, quads and core," says Sacerdoti: "It works balance, mobility and stretching—it’s very versatile."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any lower-body exercises—squats, lunges and deadlifts—are good because the lower-body contains the largest muscle groups and muscle building is really important—it's like the holy grail when it comes to longevity," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-do-a-lunge" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-a-lunge"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do a lunge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="1fc577c6-9217-4f33-aaad-fbbc27d682fb"&gt;Sacerdoti says any type of lunge is great for building muscle and supporting longevity. Once you can comfortably perform three sets of 10 bodyweight lunges, you can progress by adding weights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zRC3YREpKJiJHpDm2H94YF" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zRC3YREpKJiJHpDm2H94YF slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both forward and reverse lunges are effective options. The difference between a forward lunge and reverse lunge is the forward lunge places more emphasis on your quads, while the reverse lunge activates the glutes and hamstrings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-do-a-reverse-lunge" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-a-reverse-lunge"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do a reverse lunge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul id="b0800c40-c825-4198-b76d-dc727e9b8977"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand with feet hip-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides or using just your bodyweight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Step back with one leg, bending the front knee and lowering your back knee until it taps the floor or close to. Both knees should be at roughly 90° angles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pause then drive through your front leg to return to the starting position.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complete 10 to 12 repetitions, then switch sides.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-do-a-forward-lunge" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-a-forward-lunge"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do a forward lunge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="youtube-video youtube-facade" data-nosnippet id="g8-Ge9S0aUw"&gt;

Both knees should be at roughly 90° angles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pause then drive through your front leg and return to the starting position.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complete 10 to 12 repetitions, then switch legs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a id="elk-expert-tips-to-nail-the-lunge" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-expert-tips-to-nail-the-lunge"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Expert tips to nail the lunge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="7dee9df1-6bbb-4445-968a-0f981022f2d5"&gt;Even though the lunge looks straightforward, form is crucial to getting the most out of the move and keeping your joints safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sacerdoti says the biggest mistake she sees is people trying to keep their feet in a single line when lunging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Instead of putting your feet directly behind each other, think about being on a train track," she says. Imagining your feet are on these parallel tracks will help with balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sacerdoti also advises that you protect your knee joint, by making sure the knee on your front leg doesn't overshoot the ankle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's when people can experience pain," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though they're called forward and backward lunges, Sacerdoti says you should think about the movement being vertical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Think of yourself as a spring, going down and up rather than forwards and back," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will help build drive, power and control. It will also help keep your upper body upright—a forward collapsing torso is another common pitfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-use-lunges-for-longevity" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-use-lunges-for-longevity"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to use lunges for longevity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="423ec2c2-c7b1-4df6-b512-f3d3ccba2962"&gt;For best results in training for longevity, Sacerdoti recommends using the principle of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/progressive-overload-explained-how-to-follow-this-simple-training-principle" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/progressive-overload-explained-how-to-follow-this-simple-training-principle"&gt;progressive overload&lt;/a&gt;, which means gradually increasing the weights you're lifting over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also Sacerdoti recommends training to failure, which means doing an exercise until you can no longer do another repetition with proper form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By the time you've completed 75% of your reps, you want to make sure that you're really being challenged," she advises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try adding lunges to your workout routine at least twice a week to see improvements in strength, mobility and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diabetes management often focuses on major habits, like diet and exercise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;However, small changes can add up to big gains for better blood sugar management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some of these include walking after meals, taking deep breaths and chewing your food slowly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Successful diabetes management hinges on your day-to-day habits. While much of the focus is on major habits, like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/why-cutting-carbs-can-backfire-11748539" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cutting carbs and exercising regularly&lt;/a&gt;, it can be easy to overlook the small stuff. But here’s the thing. The small stuff can make a &lt;em&gt;big &lt;/em&gt;difference. Because in the end, effective diabetes management is a long game.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you sit down to a meal, &lt;a href="https://seemashahrd.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Seema Shah, M.P.H., M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, recommends &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15316/how-to-eat-more-vegetables/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;eating nonstarchy vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, like broccoli, zucchini and dark, leafy greens, first. Why? Some research suggests that the order in which you eat your food might have a direct &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-avoid-after-5-pm-for-better-blood-sugar-control-11763955" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;impact on your post-meal blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; numbers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For instance, one review study concluded that eating &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8044305/best-high-fiber-vegetables/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;fiber-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; (like nonstarchy veggies) before carbohydrate-heavy foods reduces the rate at which food empties from your stomach. This can slow the release of carbohydrates into your bloodstream, blunting the rise in glucose levels after a meal. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, front-loading fiber isn’t the only way to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-avoid-if-you-have-prediabetes-8611177" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prevent post-meal glucose spikes&lt;/a&gt;. Eating protein or fat first has also been shown to have a similar effect. So, after you eat your veggies, move on to protein next and finish with carbohydrates. While this small habit may not drastically change your blood sugar, every little bit helps.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-no-sugar-high-fiber-and-high-protein-meal-plan-8646974" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber and protein are more satiating&lt;/a&gt; than carbs, so this strategy might also help with weight management.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Are you a speedy eater? You’re hardly alone. However, one study found this all-too-common habit could be raising your blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While hectic schedules can make it difficult to carve out time to eat without rushing, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290947/mindful-eating-the-key-to-eating-what-you-want-and-fully-enjoying-it/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating more mindfully&lt;/a&gt; can do your body—and blood sugar–good. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To combat the urge to eat too quickly, try focusing on chewing each bite of food thoroughly. “It allows for slower, more mindful eating, and breaks down foods better, making it easier to digest and absorb nutrients,” says Shah. She adds that adopting the habit of eating slowly and chewing your food thoroughly can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7900070/how-to-stop-weight-gain-according-to-health-experts/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;curb overeating&lt;/a&gt; by giving your body time to release important satiety hormones. It also improves insulin response. If you’re wondering how much chewing is enough, Shah recommends chewing your food until it reaches a slurry-like consistency.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-check-your-blood-sugar-on-a-schedule"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Check Your Blood Sugar on a Schedule &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regularly checking and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290761/best-time-to-check-blood-glucose-after-meal/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;recording your blood glucose levels&lt;/a&gt; is key for optimal blood sugar management. But there’s one tweak to make it even more helpful. “Check your blood sugar at the same time each day,” says endocrinologist &lt;a href="https://www.medicalofficesofmanhattan.com/our-team/dr-yesika-garcia/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Yesika Garcia, M.D.&lt;/a&gt; Recording your blood sugar readings at the same time each day makes it easier to identify patterns that can help your health care provider make adjustments to your medication regimen. Creating a schedule may also make it easier to remember to check your numbers, especially if you are newly diagnosed with diabetes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you aren’t excited about the idea of pricking your finger multiple times throughout the day, Garcia recommends asking your health care provider about a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/heres-why-you-shouldnt-measure-your-blood-sugar-with-your-smartwatch-according-to-the-fda-8601517" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;continuous blood glucose monitor&lt;/a&gt;. These small, wearable devices check your blood glucose 24/7 for easy, effortless monitoring, no finger pricks required.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-take-some-deep-breaths"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Take Some Deep Breaths &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Stress management is a critical—yet often overlooked—piece of the diabetes management puzzle. The reason? Our body and mind are closely connected. When stress hits, our bodies respond by pumping out large amounts of the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054352/6-fast-ways-to-lower-cortisol-levels/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stress hormone cortisol&lt;/a&gt;. Trouble is, high cortisol levels can also elevate blood sugar. While the occasional cortisol surge is no big deal, regular spikes may spell trouble for long-term blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Practicing some deep breathing can help lower stress hormones and induce relaxation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Done regularly, it might help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/simple-ways-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check-11791785" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce those stress-induced blood sugar spikes&lt;/a&gt;. While there are many types of deep breathing methods that can help, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaitlin-hippley?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_campaign=share_via&amp;amp;utm_content=profile&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Kaitlin Hippley, M.Ed., RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, recommends a research-backed technique known as box breathing. “Box breathing is a technique where you inhale for four seconds, hold for four, exhale for four and hold for four again.” It’s quick, effective, and you can do it almost anywhere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-go-for-a-post-meal-walk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Go for a Post-Meal Walk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You don’t have to exercise for hours to tackle high blood sugar. Simply taking a short walk after a meal can help. “This will help you naturally lower your blood glucose after meals by helping your muscles pull sugar from your bloodstream into your cells,” says &lt;a href="https://www.vandanasheth.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vandana Sheth, RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, research has shown that walking for just 20 minutes after a meal can reduce post-meal blood glucose. For even more blood sugar–lowering power, take that after-meal walk outdoors. You’ll double down on physical activity and relieve stress at the same time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-pair-carbs-with-protein"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Pair Carbs with Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Whenever you choose to eat a carb like fruit, whole-grain crackers or sprouted bread, pair them with a protein buddy,” says Hippley. “This simple combo can help slow down how quickly carbs turn into glucose, help steady blood sugars, and keep you feeling fuller longer.” Protein also helps preserve lean muscle mass, which can boost insulin sensitivity and improve blood sugar control. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At snack time, think string cheese, natural peanut butter or low-sodium turkey, says Hippley. For meals, make one-quarter of your plate lean protein, like skinless chicken, fish, lean beef or pork, beans, lentils or edamame. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Managing diabetes is a marathon, not a sprint. Over time, certain small daily habits can add up to big blood sugar wins. Tiny tweaks, like eating your veggies before carbs at meals, chewing your food thoroughly and pairing carbs with protein, are all simple and effective ways to lower blood sugar. So are strategies like checking your blood sugar on a schedule, taking a few deep breaths when you’re stressed or going for a quick walk after meals. While all of these small habits can have a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290068/12-healthy-ways-to-lower-your-blood-sugar/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;big impact on your blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, there’s no need to bite them all off at once. Pick the ones that you feel are most manageable first. Then, if you feel you’re ready for more, add on from there. In the end, the results will add up quickly!&lt;br&gt;
