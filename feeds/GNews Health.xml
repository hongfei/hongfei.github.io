Researchers developed a novel method to keep test subjects’ eyes open, allowing them to monitor these dynamics without disrupting sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that pupil changes correspond to sleep stages, brain waves, and responsiveness to sound, suggesting the brain remains highly active even at rest. This discovery could lead to new ways of diagnosing and treating sleep disorders and other neurological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pupil Fluctuations:&lt;/strong&gt; Pupil size changes during sleep, reflecting brain activation levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linked to Sleep Stages:&lt;/strong&gt; Pupil dynamics correlate with deep sleep waves and memory-related brain activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Diagnostic Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; Tracking pupil changes could help diagnose sleep disorders and neurological conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;ETH Zurich&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our eyes are typically closed when we sleep. However, there is a flurry of activity taking place beneath our closed eyelids: a team of researchers, led by principal investigators Caroline Lustenberger, Sarah Meissner and Nicole Wenderoth from the Neural Control of Movement Lab at ETH Zurich, have observed that the size of the pupil fluctuates constantly during sleep. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it increases in size, sometimes it decreases; sometimes these changes occur within seconds, other times over the course of several minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108055"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman sleeping." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;. They hope to discover whether this region of the brain is in fact responsible for controlling the pupils during sleep, and how changes in the level of activation affect sleep and its functions. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These dynamics reflect the state of arousal, or the level of brain activation in regions that are responsible for sleep-wake regulation,” says Lustenberger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These observations contradict the previous assumption that, essentially, the level of arousal during sleep is low.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, these fluctuations in pupil size show that even during sleep, the brain is constantly switching between a higher and lower level of activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These new findings also confirm for humans what other research groups have recently discovered in studies on rodents, who also exhibit slow fluctuations in the activation level (known in the field as arousal).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study by the ETH researchers was recently published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;New method for an old mystery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regions of the brain which control the activation level are situated deep within the brainstem, making it previously difficult to directly measure these processes in humans during sleep. Existing methods are technically demanding and have not yet been established in this context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ETH researchers’ study therefore relies on pupil measurements. Pupils are known to indicate the activation level when a person is awake. They can therefore be used as markers for the activity in regions situated deeper within the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ETH researchers developed a new method for examining the changes in people’s pupils while asleep: using a special adhesive technique and a transparent plaster, they were able to keep the eyes of the test subjects open for several hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our main concern was that the test subjects would be unable to sleep with their eyes open. But in a dark room, most people forget that their eyes are still open and they are able to sleep,” explains the study’s lead author, Manuel Carro Domínguez, who developed the technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the data showed that pupil dynamics is related not just to the different stages of sleep, but also to specific patterns of brain activity, such as sleep spindles and pronounced deep sleep waves – brain waves that are important for memory consolidation and sleep stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also discovered that the brain reacts to sounds with varying degrees of intensity, depending on the level of activation, which is reflected in the size of the pupil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A central regulator of the activation level is a small region in the brainstem, known as the locus coeruleus. In animals, scientists have been able to show that this is important for the regulation of sleep stages and waking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ETH researchers were unable to prove in this study whether the locus coeruleus is indeed directly responsible for pupil changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are simply observing pupil changes that are related to the level of brain activation and heart activity,” Lustenberger explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up study, the researchers will attempt to influence the activity of the locus coeruleus using medication, so that they can investigate how this affects pupil dynamics. They hope to discover whether this region of the brain is in fact responsible for controlling the pupils during sleep, and how changes in the level of activation affect sleep and its functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Using pupillary dynamics to diagnose illnesses&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding pupil dynamics during sleep could also provide important insights for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders and other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers therefore want to investigate whether pupil changes during sleep can provide indications of dysfunctions of the arousal system. These include disorders such as insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder and possibly Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are just hypotheses that we want to investigate in the future,” says Lustenberger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another goal is to make the technology usable outside of sleep laboratories, such as in hospitals where it could help to monitor waking in coma patients or to diagnose sleep disorders more accurately. The pupil as a window onto the brain could thus pave the way for new opportunities in sleep medicine and neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and brain activity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#254844574c444b4b400b4950464c404b654d4e0b40514d5f0b464d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Marianne Lucien&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://hk.ethz.ch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ETH Zurich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Marianne Lucien – ETH Zurich&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-57289-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pupil size reveals arousal level fluctuations in human sleep&lt;/a&gt;” by Sarah Meissner et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pupil size reveals arousal level fluctuations in human sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent animal research has revealed the intricate dynamics of arousal levels that are important for maintaining proper sleep resilience and memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, changes in arousal level are believed to be a determining characteristic of healthy and pathological sleep but tracking arousal level fluctuations has been methodologically challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we measured pupil size, an established indicator of arousal levels, by safely taping the right eye open during overnight sleep and tested whether pupil size affects cortical response to auditory stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that pupil size dynamics change as a function of important sleep events across different temporal scales. In particular, our results show pupil size to be inversely related to the occurrence of sleep spindle clusters, a marker of sleep resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we found pupil size prior to auditory stimulation to influence the evoked response, most notably in delta power, a marker of several restorative and regenerative functions of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recording pupil size dynamics provides insights into the interplay between arousal levels and sleep oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 22:19:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE9WS0tnRDZwY2pVNldEdUpBMkJESmtWbFdwczhvMlNXQ0ZXTlR6ZjlDeGYtQVlUYWU0b2traXM4MzJlME5zLWRkX3BadlZpdlc3UmY4VlM5WjJjSFFQeVp3LU9sSDhNV2ZraFpyYWdxMA</guid></item><item><title>Kennedy’s push for vitamins in response to measles outbreak worries physicians - The Hill</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQc0wzLTVHd0NQX3B1S2VWWWZVV2h5Nk9xSDE3UlBKeC11VjBZMW9zR3IyRUpDanI1Rm1BS1lqNGFwTm5zVXZKbThmeEN2R0k3RW5YVUFWTEkzbUVVUmlnaXdOeGNYSHdNdWhqcmpzeGJ2NDY4djlOU09MN1F3SThQSlBRMXhzVjNXdVNjVlgwSdIBlAFBVV95cUxPWDFaM29Qbnd0YVpsSW1iWVdZTnJVa1NXOTJGd2pTQ2RnYjJzWmNkWWhXQmhsZElGTzJ1ampWNDliOVpUanNOT3c0QnZ2QVdLYnVZeHJlOE9fRFl0bktYYkJEZVY2MWE5c0RoRE5JSXZmZGpCX20yMGJQTDJCSE1vNU5kNEhDUmNMVXVzMklSOUpSa2hS?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

            A common but potentially dangerous vaginal infection that affects &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/bacterial-vaginosis" target="_blank"&gt;nearly 1 in 3 women&lt;/a&gt; globally should be considered a sexually transmitted disease, a new study says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000g3b6m7yd875xb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bacterial vaginosis, or BV, is currently viewed as a woman’s issue, thus leaving the sexual partner untreated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000h3b6mbd9g0pje@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I started getting them quite recurrently. I’d go to doctors and get treated with antibiotics, and it would almost always come back,” said Hanae, a woman who participated in the clinical trial on BV conducted in Melbourne, Australia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000i3b6m1qc67h71@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s like not really worth it for me to even go to doctors,” said Hanae, whose last name was withheld by the study authors to protect her privacy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000j3b6m9b0gzd90@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For half of all women with bacterial vaginosis, the infection returns after completion of a week of antibiotics, the preferred medical treatment for BV, said first author Lenka Vodstrcil, a senior research fellow at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre at Monash University in Australia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000k3b6migl20api@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The bacteria that cause BV can be located in men, especially in penile skin and also in the urethra,” Vodstrcil said in a news release. “This suggests that BV is probably sexually transmitted, and that is why so many women get it back again after treatment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000l3b6mdi3rgpzw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When BV was treated as a sexually transmitted disease, with both partners receiving oral antibiotics and men using topical creams, the recurrence rate dropped by over half, according to the study &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2405404" target="_blank"&gt;published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000m3b6mmzse9gdk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our trial has shown that reinfection from partners is causing a lot of the BV recurrence women experience, and provides evidence that BV is in fact a STI (sexually transmitted infection),” said senior author Catriona Bradshaw in an email. Bradshaw is a professor at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre at Monash University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000n3b6msbutmsq8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bacterial-vaginosis/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of BV can include itching, pain while urinating, an odd odor and a thin, white vaginal discharge. For some women, however, BV is a silent predator, attacking without such telltale symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000o3b6mojfbx4r6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If left untreated, bacterial vaginosis can increase the risk of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3788616/" target="_blank"&gt;acquiring HIV&lt;/a&gt; as well as sexually transmitted infections, according to the World Health Organization. Women with BV can also develop an infection in the fallopian tubes, ovaries or uterus called pelvic inflammatory disease, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/bacterial-vaginosis" target="_blank"&gt;the WHO states on its website.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000p3b6mhf8ea90g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Such infections can lead to later infertility, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000q3b6mtrxussf4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We see very significant changes in a range of inflammatory markers, inflammatory cells and bacterial enzymes and products that result in damage to the epithelium — the lining of the reproductive tract,” Bradshaw said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000r3b6m9va5i0gi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bacterial vaginosis is especially dangerous during pregnancy. The infection can lead to premature birth, spontaneous abortion and low birth weight in the baby, according to the WHO.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000s3b6m8mk4h6m8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The randomized clinical trial of 164 monogamous couples was conducted at multiple centers in Australia. In 81 of the couples, both partners were treated with seven days of oral antibiotics. During that time, the male partner also used a topical antibiotic on their penis twice a day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000t3b6mtotxhxhe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In accordance with current recommended treatment, only the woman in the other 83 couples was treated with an oral antibiotic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000u3b6m8lsuuynw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the study only treated heterosexual couples, it’s “important to note that women in same sex relationships also transmit BV bacteria between each other during sex, and that these same sex couples in monogamous relationships have very high rates of concordance for BV — both have it or both don’t have it,” Bradshaw said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000v3b6m2cdnnd4s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The trial was meant to last for 12 weeks, but researchers stopped it early when it was quickly apparent that treating both partners reduced BV occurrence by 60%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000w3b6mb2qe6bd2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Viewing such a common vaginal infection as a sexually transmitted disease would be a “paradigm shift” and would require doctors to encourage a woman’s male partner to share responsibility for transmission and treatment, according to an editorial&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;published alongside the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000x3b6mvogvl7hk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It will also require a willingness of male partners to commit to taking both oral and topical medications, once notified by their female partner that she has bacterial vaginosis and that it is probably sexually transmitted,” wrote Dr. Christina Muzny and Dr. Jack Sobel, who were not involved in the new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000y3b6mgccrv3g1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Muzny is a professor of infectious disease at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Sobel is a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000z3b6m80dwmzth@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Men in the study had no problem completing the course of oral and topical antibiotics, with few to no side effects, the study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr100103b6m5patfce6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have now used this medication in close to 300 men and we have not had any report that side effects from the medication would stop them taking it,” Bradshaw said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr100113b6makscikci@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Melbourne Sexual Health Centre has already changed its protocols and are now treating both partners when BV is detected, Bradshaw added. For health professionals and couples interested in treating both partners, the research team is developing a website&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that provides detailed information on male partner treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr100123b6mvggb4elm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Changes in national and international treatment guidelines always take time, so we felt an obligation to provide accurate online and downloadable information,” Bradshaw said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It will also require a willingness of male partners to commit to taking both oral and topical medications, once notified by their female partner that she has bacterial vaginosis and that it is probably sexually transmitted,” wrote Dr. Christina Muzny and Dr. Jack Sobel, who were not involved in the new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Muzny is a professor of infectious disease at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Sobel is a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit.

            Men in the study had no problem completing the course of oral and topical antibiotics, with few to no side effects, the study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “We have now used this medication in close to 300 men and we have not had any report that side effects from the medication would stop them taking it,” Bradshaw said.

            The Melbourne Sexual Health Centre has already changed its protocols and are now treating both partners when BV is detected, Bradshaw added. For health professionals and couples interested in treating both partners, the research team is developing a website&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that provides detailed information on male partner treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Changes in national and international treatment guidelines always take time, so we felt an obligation to provide accurate online and downloadable information,” Bradshaw said.

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;BV is thought to affect up to a third of reproductive-aged women and is caused by an overgrowth of harmful bacteria in the vagina and a reduction in “good”

It has also been associated with an increased risk of infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2405404" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, researchers in Australia report how they studied two groups of monogamous, heterosexual couples in which the women had BV. In one group of 81 couples, the women and their male partners were given oral and topical antimicrobial treatment. In the other group of 83 couples, only women received the tablets and cream. The results were stark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The trial was stopped by the data and safety monitoring board after 150 couples had completed the 12-week follow-up period because treatment of the woman only was inferior to treatment of both the woman and her male partner,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Overall, 24 of 69 women (35%) in the group where both partners were treated had BV return, compared with 43 of the 68 women in the group where only women were treated. In addition, the team found the average time until an infection returned was longer when both partners were treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While sex has long been known to be a trigger for BV, experts previously thought it did not meet the criteria for a sexually transmitted infection, partly because earlier research found no improvement in cure rates in women with BV when male partners were given oral antimicrobials alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dr Janet Wilson, a consultant in sexual health at Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust who was not involved with the work, said the study, while small, supported the view BV was an STI. But she added that many people with BV became “celibate” and found the condition could still be difficult to clear &lt;strong&gt;– &lt;/strong&gt;meaning treating partners did not provide a full solution for preventing infections recurring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This is a great paper and it will change how we manage BV in those in long-term monogamous relationships,” she said, adding it was a “big step forward”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Of the NHS website’s current page on BV, she said: “Much of the information is outdated and misleading.

Researchers identified two types of neurons—one responding to both stimuli and another selectively activated by either pain or itch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using advanced synaptic analysis and chemogenetic techniques, they found that these neurons receive separate inputs from the mediodorsal thalamus. The findings challenge the long-held belief that pain and itch share the same neural pathways, providing new insights into how the brain differentiates between these sensations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Neural Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; Pain and itch are processed by separate neuronal populations in the ACC.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selective Neuronal Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; Some neurons respond to both stimuli, while others are stimulus-specific.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential for Therapy:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding these circuits may help develop treatments for chronic pain and itch disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Institute for Basic Science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A research team led by KAANG Bong-Kiun, director of the Center for Cognition and Sociality within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS), and KO Hyoung-Gon, professor at Kyung Hee University College of Dentistry, have uncovered the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of pain and itch in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides new insights into how the brain distinguishes between these two distinct sensory experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pain and itch are both unpleasant sensations, but they trigger different responses—pain often prompts withdrawal, while itching leads to scratching. Until now, scientists have struggled to understand how the brain processes these sensations separately, as they share overlapping neural pathways from the spinal cord to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both stimuli are transmitted from the spinal cord to the thalamus and brainstem, eventually reaching the ACC. The ACC is a key brain region involved in various functions, ranging from basic sensory processing to higher-order cognition. However, a comprehensive understanding of how a limited number of neurons within the ACC execute such diverse functions has been lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides fundamental insights into how ACC neurons selectively process pain and itch information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By analyzing neuronal response patterns in the ACC to pain and itch stimuli, the research team identified two distinct neuronal populations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Non-selective neurons, which respond to both pain and itch stimuli indiscriminately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Stimulus-specific neurons, which were selectively activated by either pain or itch stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, using the dual-eGRASP technique—an advanced synaptic analysis method developed by Kaang’s research team (Science, 2018)—the researchers discovered that stimulus-specific neurons in the ACC receive distinct synaptic inputs from the mediodorsal thalamus (MD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding indicates that pain and itch are processed by independent neuronal populations within the ACC, which receive differentiated synaptic inputs, providing fundamental insights into the neural mechanisms of pain and itch processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further confirm the role of these neurons, the team used chemogenetic techniques to selectively deactivate either pain-specific or itch-specific neurons. The results showed suppressing pain neurons reduced pain perception without affecting itch, and vice versa. This discovery suggests that these neurons play a direct role in shaping how we experience pain and itch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study presents a groundbreaking discovery that the role of ACC neurons in processing pain or itch is predetermined. Importantly, the study demonstrates that pain- and itch-specific neurons in the ACC are synaptically paired with corresponding stimulus-specific neurons in the MD, establishing independent neural circuits for pain and itch processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings challenge the conventional assumption that pain and itch signals follow overlapping pathways and instead highlight distinct neural mechanisms for each sensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that the ACC is known to mediate the affective aspects of pain and itch, this study suggests that separate neuronal populations are responsible for encoding the subjective experience of pain and itch. Building upon these findings, the research team aims to further investigate the brain’s complex sensory processing mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corresponding author KAANG Bong-Kiun stated, “The ACC is an important brain area not only for memory storage but also for processing higher-order emotions such as pain and conflict. Through this study, we have taken a step further in understanding emotional memory at the synaptic level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-corresponding author and first author KO Hyoung-Gon commented, “I am particularly interested in how these pain- and itch-selective neural circuits change under pathological conditions. Moving forward, we plan to expand our research to explore the interactions between these circuits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About this pain and neuroscience research news&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1b6c72777772686e735b72796835697e357069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;William Suh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ibs.re.kr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Institute for Basic Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;William Suh – Insititute for Basic Science&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image:&lt;/strong&gt; The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-57041-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Processing of pain and itch information by modality-specific neurons within the anterior cingulate cortex in mice&lt;/a&gt;” by KAANG Bong-Kiun et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processing of pain and itch information by modality-specific neurons within the anterior cingulate cortex in mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pain and itch are aversive sensations with distinct qualities, processed in overlapping pathways and brain regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which is critical for their affective dimensions. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying their processing in the ACC remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we identify modality-specific neuronal populations in layer II/III of the ACC in mice involved in pain and itch processing. Using a synapse labeling tool, we show that pain- and itch-related neurons selectively receive synaptic inputs from mediodorsal thalamic neurons activated by pain and itch stimuli, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemogenetic inhibition of these neurons reduced pruriception or nociception without affecting the opposite modality. Conversely, activation of these neurons did not enhance stimulus-specific responses but commonly increased freezing-like behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings reveal that the processing of itch and pain information in the ACC involves activity-dependent and modality-specific neuronal populations, and that pain and itch are processed by functionally distinct ACC neuronal subsets.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 21:53:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiYEFVX3lxTFBLdkJVc0xkMWw3T1pBVFZlQ3o2ZHJ6Vi1ONWNVWEJIX1ktTEZ0NTU3ZThGd1ZSU2txcUZ4UUw0Q3FrQnMza1BKRGVCV2V4Q2FMOUczOE5iLXV0YkxhYkRnNg</guid></item><item><title>Hugely popular diet linked to colon cancer rising rapidly in young people - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxPS0RWdTdoa0xEdkV2b0g3RXBiajhFQm5mX2NLemxSVnFIZnJMR3RvbHBLbkJaOG5WV0xKV0RVRjBuS1FuM0xhczB3WTFYeWcwbFJodnNCMHkwaFlZVTVKa3lrdTJUZFJVek1mckp2dmZaZHEyc2d1enpRSWJEZFg4NXR1OG5qaHZsb2k5dU50M2xGZUtlaTFIdTBRQXFNd1BkZXlOVtIBqgFBVV95cUxOLXpJaUNwZVJ6aDdsSUV4Nnk5VVdHeHIxdHp5RXdrWXVnNXdqdWJFdmpmRmtfcGJmNUF0TGpFMzR1b05ubzlpdVlfaldrRUdvWEF2MUc4cTFkMVlJQzJuV3FhMmVWeXFZMzVXeGY0SV9QWmhHUlBvc3p2U3RjMmVFcFdKRnhUaG1iUUJBcjRKMU40UXVBcTFxanJndjRkVWJDa1piN1gxQkRiQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the keto may help you &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-5e13a360-f9ef-11ef-810c-834c61337116"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt;, it could raise your risk of colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-5e118080-f9ef-11ef-810c-834c61337116"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, a study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A group of Canadian researchers found that low-carb diets such as keto may foster the growth of toxic compounds that are linked to colorectal cancer in the intestine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They revealed not getting enough carbs can cause a strain of &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/e-coli/index.html" id="mol-c0131560-f9f3-11ef-ba27-e1753911d2e7"&gt;E coli&lt;/a&gt; bacteria naturally present present in the body to produce a toxin called colibactin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said colibactin can cause abnormal growths called polyps to form in the colon, which could develop into tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings suggest that stripping carbs out of your diet could increase your risk of developing colon cancer, which has become &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14321887/colon-cancer-young-patients-study-three-risk-factors.html"&gt;increasingly prevalent in young Americans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the scientists claim that more research is still needed. This is because not only was the study done in mice, but refined carbs have been linked to other health issues that can raise colon cancer risk, such as obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating too many carbs, particularly refined sugars, has been linked to a host of health problems as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fiber-rich foods like berries, lentils, and nuts, meanwhile, could lower the risk of cancer by helping stool move smoothly through the colon, they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The study concluded that a lack of carbohydrates and fiber dramatically increases cancer risk when combined with certain E coli bacteria&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the rise of colorectal cancer in Americans under 50 over the past two decades. This shows the latest year for which data is available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alberto Martin, a professor of immunology at the University of Toronto and senior author said: 'Colorectal cancer has always been thought of as being caused by a number of different factors including diet, gut microbiome, environment and genetics.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our question was, does diet influence the ability of specific bacteria to cause cancer?' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13710593/How-keto-diets-WRECK-body-ultra-low-carb-plan-raises-cholesterol-reduces-friendly-gut-bacteria-experts-discover.html"&gt;low-carb diet &lt;/a&gt;cuts out foods like white pasta and bread and instead focuses on protein such as fish, fats such as nuts and avocados as well as non-starchy vegetables such as broccoli and celery.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The diet has been linked to several health benefits including stabilizing blood sugar levels, reducing insulin resistance in people with &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-7ea2b180-f9d0-11ef-be27-91ceb1a3b4f3"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and improve cholesterol levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the latest data, seven percent of Americans - 23million - follow low-carb diets like keto, and interest in them has nearly doubled in the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, colon cancer has surged in young Americans, with diagnoses &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-11808449/Mystery-colon-cancer-epidemic-young-people-America.html" class=""&gt;expected to nearly double from 2010 to 2030&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates over 154,000 Americans will be &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6574107/Colorectal-cancer-rates-deaths-soaring-especially-young-adults.html" class=""&gt;struck with the colon cancer this year, and just under 53,000 will die&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, about 19,550 people under age 50 were diagnosed with colorectal cancer in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in the new study, &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-025-01938-4"&gt;published this week&lt;/a&gt;, examined mice that had already been affected with the bacteria Bacteroides fragilis, Helicobacter hepaticus or the E coli strain NC101.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Bacteroides fragilis has long been known to produce a toxin that can cause inflammation and tissue damage in the colon - leading to colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the case of Helicobacter hepaticus, some studies have found that its presence in humans can statistically increase the probability of developing and dying from colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both Bacteroides fragilis and Helicobacter hepaticus are naturally found inside humans, primarily in the colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey Hutchins of Tennessee, pictured at left, died of colon cancer earlier this year at age 26. Monica Ackermann of Australia, pictured at right, was just 31 when she was diagnosed with colon cancer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to the study, the E coli strain NC101 has been found in about 60 percent of colorectal cancer cases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mice were either fed a balanced, low-carb or Western-style diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results found that the mice who were both infected with E coli NC101 and ate a low-carb diet produced a toxic compound called colibactin, which can damage colon cell DNA and cause polyps to form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NC101 strain of E coli has been found in about 60 percent of colorectal cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;E coli NC101, also known as gut-resident bacteria, is naturally found inside the intestines and helps break down food compounds as well as produce vitamins. While most E coli strains are harmless, NC101 has been linked to colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also found that the same group of mice had thinner layer of mucus in their colon as compared to others - indicating that a lack of carbs can thin out the gut mucus layer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mucus layer acts as a protective shield between the bacteria in the gut and the cells underneath. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the barrier weakens, more colibactin could reach the colon cells to cause genetic damage and drive cancer tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts believe that a lack of carbohydrates can increase the risk of developing cancer when combined with E coli NC101. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the symptoms and their frequency in early onset patients, those who develop colon cancer before the age of 50, and late onset patients, those who develop the cancer after 50&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other hand the team found a diet high in fiber - specifically a prebiotic fiber called inulin - may be able to reverse some of these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prebiotic fiber is a type of dietary fiber that selectively stimulates the growth and activity of beneficial bacteria in the gut, known as probiotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It helps improve gut health by stimulating beneficial bacteria, supports digestion and bowel movements along with enhancing immunity against digestive issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Garlic, asparagus, onions, leeks, and artichokes are all high in inulin.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers did not find any significant association between the mice who had Bacteroides fragilis or Helicobacter hepaticus and were fed a low-carb diet with cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since the study was done on mice, the researchers said more human studies are needed to determine exactly how carbs and fibers are linked to colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Martin said: 'These findings could help inform dietary recommendations, probiotic safety guidelines and targeted prevention strategies for high risk individuals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But at this point, I would agree it would be premature to recommend specific diets to lower the risk of colon cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                          &lt;ul class="summary-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said vitamin A may help with the measles outbreak.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin A is used worldwide to treat children with measles, but it doesn't prevent infection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers have raised concerns that touting vitamin A mirrors anti-vaccine talking points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;span&gt;his response to the US &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/unvaccinated-child-dies-texas-measles-cases-surge-2025-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the new secretary of health, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,&lt;/span&gt; has raised eyebrows by touting vitamin A as a possible treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 146 people have been sickened and one child has died from the disease, which is spreading in West Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, who has &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-rfk-jr-plans-to-make-america-healthy-again-2024-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;opposed vaccine mandates,&lt;/a&gt; addressed the outbreak in an op-ed for &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;. While he acknowledged that the MMR vaccine protects against the disease, he did not explicitly urge Americans to get &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/unvaccinated-child-dies-texas-measles-cases-surge-2025-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;saying "the decision to vaccinate is a personal one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also said the CDC released new guidance on using vitamin A&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;as a potential treatment for measles, adding that a well-balanced diet "remains a best defense against most chronic and infectious illnesses." In a subsequent Fox News interview, he suggested treating measles with cod liver oil, a supplement high in vitamin A and vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It didn't go down well with public health workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A is often touted by vaccine skeptics, including Children's Health Defense, the anti-vaccine organization Kennedy formerly chaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While vitamin A is&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a well-studied treatment for measles, doctors and researchers told Business Insider there's no evidence it can prevent the disease. They expressed concern that Kennedy's message may perpetuate a misconception that supplements could be an alternative to vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not nearly a firm enough statement," Andrea Love, an immunologist, told Business Insider. "Good nutrition and vitamin A are not going to stop a measles outbreak."&lt;/p&gt;
                        
                      &lt;h2 id="02d2030a-9717-4f6d-be2c-ce5c600bc174" data-toc-id="02d2030a-9717-4f6d-be2c-ce5c600bc174"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, does vitamin A protect against measles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, vitamin A is used to treat patients with measles. Both the World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend giving vitamin A to &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.nfid.org/resource/vitamin-a-for-the-management-of-measles-in-the-us/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;measles patients with vitamin deficiency&lt;/a&gt; from malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can deplete the body's supply of vitamin A, and kids deficient in vitamin A are at risk of more severe infections or complications like high fever, blindness, and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic doses of vitamin A for measles range between 15,000 to 60,000 micrograms RAE per dose — much higher than the recommended daily amount for vitamin A in your diet, which is between 700 to 900 micrograms RAE. Cod liver oil is not a standard treatment for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A is less commonly administered for measles in the US where people tend to get too much vitamin A rather than too little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, dosing up on vitamin A supplements will not protect against a measles infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopher Sudfeld, a professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public — and the author of a study that Kennedy cited in his Fox News op-ed — said research supports using vitamin A to reduce the risk of complications from measles, but he stressed that supplementing it won't protect against infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The best intervention we have to prevent measles is vaccination. The MMR vaccine is safe and effective for the prevention of measles," he told BI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="7f5d9df5-c453-45cb-a666-c6bd3ac73775" data-toc-id="7f5d9df5-c453-45cb-a666-c6bd3ac73775"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin A can be toxic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using vitamin A is a major talking point for anti-vaccine advocates, who champion supplements as a protective measure, despite evidence to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why Love, the immunologist, was frustrated with Kennedy's op-ed. She felt the resulting message could confuse readers who are already skeptical of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People who see this are going to pick up on the things that resonate with their beliefs," Love told BI. "The entire wellness industry and pseudoscience landscape plays into the idea of taking control of your health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love added that it's possible to &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/vitamin-a-toxicity" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;overdose on vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;. The nutrient is fat-soluble, which means it can build up in the tissues over time. Too much can cause problems like headaches, fatigue, joint pain, liver damage, and reduced bone density.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My concern is people are going to start megadosing vitamin A and we're going to see an increase in toxicity," Love said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gold standard of protection against measles is &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/how-do-vaccines-work" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;widespread MMR vaccination&lt;/a&gt; to curtail the spread of the highly infectious virus. A vaccinated person can be infectious for days before they show symptoms, and their breath particles can linger in the air for hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most effective preventive measure is vaccination, that cannot be overemphasized," Dr. Eduardo Villamor, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Houston Methodist Hospital, UCLA, the University of Toronto, and others have tried to answer a longstanding fear that undergoing surgery on a Friday leads to higher levels of complications or even death. Their analysis of data from 429,691 patients has revealed higher rates of complications, readmissions, and mortality in the days and months following surgery compared to those who had procedures performed after the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

In surgical settings, this effect may be influenced by variations in hospital staffing, access to specialists, and care processes during weekends and is an ongoing concern in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medical+research/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medical research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weekend effect can also refer to a fear on the part of patients that surgical staff may be daydreaming about their weekend plans or that hospitals have less qualified staffing over the weekend. In the past, this weekend effect fear has also been associated with the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/automotive+industry/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;automotive industry&lt;/a&gt;, where vehicles built on a Friday were thought to have more problems, attributing loose or missing bolts to mentally checked-out mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research has previously explored this effect in hospital settings, with some studies reporting increased mortality for Friday surgeries while others found no clear pattern. With conflicting data and dual persistent concerns and fears of a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/weekend+effect/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;weekend effect&lt;/a&gt;, a comprehensive investigation was needed to systematically evaluate any impact on postoperative outcomes across a broad range of procedures and timeframes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study "Postoperative Outcomes Following Preweekend Surgery," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830842" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort analysis to determine whether patients undergoing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/surgery/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;surgery&lt;/a&gt; immediately before the weekend faced increased risks.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Data from 429,691 adults undergoing one of 25 common surgical procedures in Ontario, Canada, between 2007 and 2019 were analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups: those who underwent surgery one day before the weekend (Friday or pre-holiday) and those who had procedures one day after (Monday or post-holiday).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers assessed short-term (30 days), intermediate (90 days), and long-term (one year) postoperative outcomes, including mortality, readmissions, complications, hospital length of stay, and duration of surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis found that the pre-weekend patient group had longer hospital stays than those in the post-weekend group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients undergoing surgery immediately before the weekend had a 5% higher likelihood of experiencing a combination of mortality, complications, and readmissions within 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk of death was 9% higher at 30 days, and trended higher over time with 10% higher mortality at 90 days and 12% higher at one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, scheduled or elective procedures performed before the weekend were associated with worse postoperative outcomes, while urgent unplanned surgeries showed slightly better outcomes when performed before the weekend. Surgeons operating on Fridays had a median age of 47 years, compared to 48 years for those operating on Mondays. The median years in practice were 14 years for Friday surgeries versus 17 years for Monday surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study concludes that variations in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hospital/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt; staffing, reduced access to specialists, and differences in perioperative care processes may contribute to these trends. Future research could assess strategies to ensure high-quality postoperative care, regardless of the day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the underlying causes of these disparities in surgical outcomes are not made clear by the study, both the concerns and fears seem justified by the trends. Hospitals and medical researchers are careful not to suggest the possibility of negligence, such as surgeons daydreaming about three-day weekend plans, yet this very normal human activity also should not be ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers say it suggests that women should not be prescribed HRT if they've been menopausal for over 10 years without treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Gillian Coughlan, a neurologist at Mass General Brigham Hospital in Boston and first author of the study, said: ‘Our data indicate that HT may influence tau accumulation as a function of age, with implications for cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We hope that our study will help to inform AD risk discussions relating to women’s reproductive health and treatment.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The women who took HRT later had higher levels of a protein called tau in certain brain regions responsible for memory and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Women over 70 years old who had used hormone therapy for menopause showed faster buildup of tau, a key protein involved in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tau is a key factor in the genesis of Alzheimer’s disease, which affects nearly seven million Americans annually, around two-thirds of whom are women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tau proteins help maintain the structure and function of brain cell networks, enabling communication between cells. When this wiring is damaged, tau proteins become loose and break away, leading to communication breakdowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The damaged tau proteins clump together, forming toxic tangles in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, these tangles kill brain cells, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14190691/dementia-doctor-warns-early-alzheimers-disease-signs.html"&gt;contributing to the cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; seen in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was published in the journal Science Advances.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from Mass General Brigham, an integrated health care system that includes Harvard Medical School-affiliated hospitals and other health care facilities, recruited 146 women, with an average age ranging from 51 to 89, at the beginning of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Half had used HT an average of 14 years prior and the other half never used it at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They had PET scans checking for amyloid beta, another protein believed to be responsible for the onset of Alzheimer's, over an average of four and a half years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The graph on the left shows that in older women, HT was associated with significantly faster tau accumulation in specific brain regions, including the entorhinal cortex responsible for memory. The graph on the right shows similar increases with age in the inferior temporal gyrus involved in visual processing such as such as faces and objects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The women also underwent PET scans to look for tau tangles over three and a half years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women over 70 who used hormone therapy showed faster tau buildup in brain areas linked to memory and recognition compared to non-users of the same age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The tau accumulation was linked to cognitive decline and was only seen in HT users, suggesting that tau buildup might contribute to their cognitive issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In women under 70, HT use appeared to protect against tau buildup in the area responsible for memory consolidation, with no significant cognitive decline in non-users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers are unsure if the faster tau buildup in older HT users is due to when they started therapy or if older individuals naturally show more tau buildup in PET scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women are more likely to have higher levels of tau buildup in brain cells over the course of their lives. This could be driven by an enzyme that lives on the X chromosome, of which women have two copies compared to one in men.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means more of the enzyme enters women’s brains which inhibits the recycling of tau, leading to more build-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The decline in estrogen during menopause is believed to play a major role in the accumulation of tau in women’s brains, likely due to the hormone’s involvement in protecting the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Coughlan said: ‘Our findings add to the evidence that delaying initiation of HT, especially in older women, could lead to worse Alzheimer’s outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We hope that our study will help to inform AD risk discussions relating to women’s reproductive health and treatment.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be time to find America’s next top bottle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are everywhere — in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389424016327" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;beauty products&lt;/a&gt; we wear, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004896972304528X" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cleaning supplies&lt;/a&gt; we use and even in the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/09/health/microplastics-found-in-nearly-90-of-meat-plant-based-proteins/"&gt;food we eat&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2024/12/429161/microplastics-air-may-be-leading-lung-and-colon-cancers"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that these particles, smaller than a grain of rice, can harm reproductive, digestive and respiratory health, potentially leading to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10340669/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;colon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://enveurope.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s12302-022-00605-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;lung cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://genomicpress.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/brainmed/aop/article-10.61373-bm025c.0020/article-10.61373-bm025c.0020.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;In a new scientific paper&lt;/a&gt;, three physicians report that switching from &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/09/business/bottled-water-contains-more-plastic-particles-than-previously-thought-study/"&gt;bottled water&lt;/a&gt; to filtered tap water could cut your microplastic intake by about 90% — from 90,000 to 4,000 particles each year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;This diagram shows the chemical components of microplastics. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;In a new scientific paper, three physicians report that one switch could cut your microplastic intake by about 90% — from 90,000 to 4,000 particles each year. Colorful microplastics are shown here under a magnifying glass. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;iStockphoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Given the widespread presence of microplastics in the environment, completely eliminating exposure is unrealistic. A more practical approach is to reduce the most significant sources of microplastic intake,” the researchers wrote this week in the Genomic Press.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;This advice may be tough to swallow. Bottled water was America’s favorite packaged drink last year, &lt;a href="https://bottledwater.org/bottled-water-consumption-shift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to industry data&lt;/a&gt;, with 16.2 billion gallons consumed, a 2% increase from 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Bottled water was America’s favorite packaged drink last year, but it’s also a significant source of microplastics. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t ready to ditch your plastic bottles or don’t have &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/15/health/drinking-water-of-97m-americans-contaminated-with-unregulated-chemicals-study/"&gt;a filter for your tap&lt;/a&gt;, there are other ways to reduce microplastic intake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="p-5"&gt;“Beyond bottled water, significant dietary sources of microplastics are alcohol and seafood,” the researchers wrote. “Stopping the practice of heating food in plastic could be one of the most effective ways to reduce microplastic consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microwaving food in plastic containers can release up to 4.22 million microplastic particles per square centimeter in just a few minutes. Opt for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/26/shopping/mcirco-meal-prep-containers-deal-amazon/"&gt;glass or stainless steel containers&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other recommendations include not storing food in plastic and limiting consumption of canned and ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Highly processed foods, like chicken nuggets, contained 30 times more microplastics per gram than chicken breasts, highlighting the impact of industrial processing, which often uses plastics at some point,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“Stopping the practice of heating food in plastic could be one of the most effective ways to reduce microplastic consumption,” the researchers wrote. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The world’s companies are believed to generate nearly 460 million metric tons of plastic annually — this figure is projected to increase to 1.1 billion metric tons by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Americans inhale and ingest an estimated &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.9b01517" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;39,000 to 52,000 microplastic particles&lt;/a&gt; a year, one study found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11186737/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Microplastics have been detected&lt;/a&gt; in human &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/12/22/microplastics-found-in-placenta-are-creating-cyborg-baby/"&gt;placentas&lt;/a&gt;, kidneys, lungs, livers, testicles and blood, among other organs and tissues.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/04/health/spoonful-of-microplastics-found-in-peoples-brains-study/"&gt;Startling research&lt;/a&gt; published last month found that the human brain contains approximately a spoon’s worth of tiny shreds of plastic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These particles &lt;a href="https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/microplastics-everywhere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;can damage intestinal cells&lt;/a&gt;, trigger inflammation and disturb the balance of bacteria in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the new paper, the researchers call for more studies on the long-term health effects of microplastics and “clear” limits on their exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But while “reducing intake is a logical approach,” the researchers wrote, “it remains unclear whether this translates into a measurable reduction in microplastic accumulation within human tissues.”&lt;/p&gt;

However, engaging in health-promoting activities, such as exercise and self-care, may help mitigate these negative effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD in adulthood can create significant challenges in romantic relationships, including poor communication, financial stress, and reduced intimacy. Women often bear the burden more heavily, with some describing their experiences as similar to caring for an “additional child.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many studies focus on individuals with ADHD, less research has explored how the condition affects their partners. To address this gap, Dana Zeides Taubin and her research team at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem examined the mental health consequences for women in these relationships and explored potential coping strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 100 heterosexual couples, recruited primarily through social media, in which the male partner had a self-reported ADHD diagnosis. The men were between the ages of 20 and 60 and had been in a cohabiting relationship for at least two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The women, who averaged 33 years old, did not have ADHD themselves. They completed surveys assessing their depressive symptoms, quality of life, and participation in health-promoting activities. Additionally, they rated their partners’ ADHD-related impairments, including difficulties with time management, impulsivity, and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then used structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the relationships between ADHD-related impairment, depressive symptoms, and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several important patterns emerged. Women with partners who exhibited greater ADHD-related impairments were more likely to experience depression. They also reported a lower quality of life, particularly in social and psychological well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, women who frequently engaged in health-promoting activities—such as exercising, setting aside personal time, or socializing with close friends—reported fewer depressive symptoms and better overall well-being. Furthermore, those whose partners consistently took ADHD medication reported a higher quality of life than those whose partners were inconsistent with treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taubin and colleagues noted that women living with ADHD-diagnosed partners may experience more severe mental health challenges compared to caregivers of individuals with other chronic conditions: “notably, the depression rates in our study exceeded those reported for the broader Israeli female population. Additionally, [the women’s quality of life] scores were lower than those from comparable studies on partners of individuals with other health challenges such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the findings underscore that both medical treatment for ADHD and self-care strategies for partners may improve relationship satisfaction and mental well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study provides valuable insights, it has some limitations. Notably, it focused solely on heterosexual couples, meaning its findings may not be generalizable to same-sex relationships or relationships where both partners have ADHD. Future research should explore a more diverse range of relationships and track couples over time to examine how these dynamics evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547241280607"&gt;Depressive Symptoms and Quality of Life Among Women Living With a Partner Diagnosed With ADHD&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Dana Zeides Taubin, Haya Fogel-Grinvald, and Adina Maeir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 19:02:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxOdGJLOTBDYXUwZDdiWmJ4NUdEbmxxTFh3ejZRV1BRRUtWcFphem9WT2NMZ3gxNWlfYjZseDhRRmE5U2FFM2tKajFkZ2ZHQ1ZoZmY2a1lTdDYyMlA5QWd5aGlhT0N2NEhMSEZJclZwWU9nTDY5LVZoeGRuS1V3dDF1cThGZ0lyejlHMlFZQXBYM0NlOTZiVE91UTQ1VUdOdmstbUgzSXh0ak5fQTJxU1lr</guid></item><item><title>Women with Postpartum Depression Undergo Brain Changes During Pregnancy, Study Finds - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE50YUdudjcyRm90bGFnQm5oTVdybS1VZVNZd0I5Y3FUQ0wtMVpEVXdGM3ZJbkhCRllRODFnRVZoRDVac1RqZXRwbllieUo0dTQ2YzdMcGxiTXEweGxSX2dUZTlucmw0LWY4XzNTeFV3UzlhTjJESFozOWpRb2NQc2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Postpartum depression affects about one in every seven women who give birth, but little is known about what happens in the brains of pregnant women who experience it. A &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt5619" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; begins to shed some light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Researchers scanned the brains of dozens of women in the weeks before and after childbirth and found that two brain areas involved in the processing and control of emotions increased in size in women who developed symptoms of postpartum depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The results, published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, constitute some of the first evidence that postpartum depression is associated with changes in the brain during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Researchers found that women with symptoms of depression in the first month after giving birth also had increases in the volume of their amygdala, a brain area that plays a key role in emotional processing. Women who rated their childbirth experience as difficult or stressful — a perception that is often associated with postpartum depression — also showed increases in the volume of the hippocampus, a brain area that helps regulate emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“This is really the first step in trying to understand how does the brain change in people who have a normal course of pregnancy and then those who experience perinatal depression, and what can we do about it,” said Dr. Sheila Shanmugan, an assistant professor of psychiatry, obstetrics-gynecology and radiology at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“The big takeaways are about how there are these really profound brain changes during pregnancy and how now we’re seeing it in depression circuitry specifically,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Images/iStockphoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers assessed the data of 896 participants with an average age of 64 who typically went through menopause at around 49.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After adding up the number of symptoms — including night sweats, trouble sleeping, changes in mood, hot flashes, weight gain and “brain fog” — they found that women who reported more of these symptoms had greater cognitive impairment, which is considered a precursor for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/13/health/your-sense-of-taste-could-predict-if-youre-more-likely-to-die-younger/"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and other types of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;	



&lt;p&gt;This led the authors to conclude that more menopause symptoms may be associated with experiencing worse cognitive and behavioral decline in later life. Both of those are risk factors for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Estrogen-based hormone therapy may contribute to mitigating clinical symptoms, particularly behavioral symptoms,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This corroborates with previous research, such as a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/early-menopause-may-raise-risk-of-dementia-later-in-life?" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; that found women who go through menopause before the age of 40 are 35% more likely to develop dementia than those who experience it later in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around twice as many women have &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/blog/why-dementia-different-women#:~:text=Women%20have%20a%20greater%20risk,risk%20factor%20for%20this%20disease." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; than men. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts believe that while some of this may be because women simply live longer on average, the decline in estrogen levels that occurs during menopause could also play a role, given that estrogen is essential for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/28/health/having-kids-can-fight-brain-aging-the-more-children-the-better/?utm_campaign=nypost&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But lifestyle factors are also significant, and this new study’s authors &lt;a href="https://plos.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/#U0000000Ifis/a/PM000007vUgU/qLBwEBBZgYshFYAD5JRmeKkzuDNSWYgZ7snFITtSY7k" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;believe&lt;/a&gt; that knowing that there’s a link between menopause and Alzheimer’s disease “can allow time for more preventative interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These interventions not only include addressing hormonal status, but also comprise managing vascular risk factors, reducing inflammation from Western diet and environmental toxins, optimizing gut health and gut biome diversity and supporting social interactions,” they said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/22/health/6-easy-lifestyle-hacks-that-can-slash-your-risk-of-dementia/"&gt;six lifestyle habits&lt;/a&gt; — exercising, not drinking or smoking, getting enough sleep, socializing and having hobbies — can slash your risk of developing dementia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent research also suggests &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/health/antidepressants-may-worsen-dementia-decline-what-to-know/"&gt;anti-depressants&lt;/a&gt; could actually speed up the rate of cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, people in Ikaria, Greece — an island with shockingly low rates of dementia — swear by tea, coffee and a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/17/health/greek-island-with-almost-no-dementia-the-two-drinks-they-love/"&gt;slight twist on the Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; as their secret to staying sharp in old age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; First and foremost, this recipe offers a trifecta of healthy fats, protein and fiber in every bite. According to registered dietitian nutritionist &lt;a href="https://www.connectwithsage.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Elana Natker, M.S.&lt;/a&gt;, “The Mediterranean diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts and seeds. This filling breakfast hits on many of those, offering fiber, protein and healthy fats to keep you fuller longer, reducing your chances of needing a midmorning snack.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Packed with Protein  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With 18 grams of protein per serving, our Overnight Quinoa Pudding is crafted to help keep you full until your next meal. In fact, research shows that protein is more satisfying and filling than either fat or carbohydrates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “While breakfast isn’t traditionally large in size on a Mediterranean diet, focusing on eating foods that do provide some of this nutrient, including dairy foods like yogurt, can help keep you full as you conquer your morning to-do [list],” says culinary dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.justwendyjo.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wendy Jo Peterson, M.S., RDN,&lt;/a&gt; author of the &lt;em&gt;Mediterranean Diet Cookbook for Dummies&lt;/em&gt;. Speaking of which, the bulk of the protein content in this recipe comes from kefir, a fermented drink offering 9 grams of protein per 1-cup serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The remaining protein is thanks to the chia seeds and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8068328/is-quinoa-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;quinoa&lt;/a&gt;—a plant-based protein source containing all nine of the essential amino acids.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; High in Fiber  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High-fiber foods, like berries, vegetables and legumes, are abundant in the Mediterranean diet. In addition to keeping you full for longer, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; has been linked with benefits for heart and gut health. It may also reduce the risk of certain types of cancer and can support weight management.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Per the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, it’s recommended that adults get 28 to 34 grams of fiber per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This overnight pudding helps move you closer to your daily fiber goal, offering 9 grams of fiber per serving, depending on the types of berries used. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Want to maximize your fiber intake? Raspberries are a treasure trove of fiber, providing 8 grams per 1-cup serving!&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Contains Healthy Fats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Mediterranean diet does not shy away from fats but it does choose them wisely. Olive oil, nuts and seeds are staples of the diet and contribute to its heart-healthy benefits thanks to their concentrations of unsaturated fats. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While they’re not part of a traditional Mediterranean diet, Peterson notes that chia seeds are an excellent addition to this eating pattern because of their omega-3 content.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Our Overnight Quinoa Pudding features 1 tablespoon of these tiny seeds, contributing 2.5 grams of omega-3s to your morning meal.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Simple, Convenient &amp;amp; Versatile &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This recipe takes about five minutes to make and can be prepared in a large batch, making it a win-win for busy mornings. Plus, you can easily put your own spin on it, swapping in ingredients you have on hand. Prefer honey to maple syrup? Or want to nix the added sugar completely? No problem! Feel free to get creative and adjust the recipe to meet your needs.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If getting enough protein seems like a challenge on the Mediterranean diet, we’ve got you covered. “While the Mediterranean diet suggests only one serving of dairy or eggs per day and limiting your red meat intake, other great protein sources that are encouraged in the Mediterranean diet include nuts and nut butters, seafood and poultry,” says Natker. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are three simple swaps that add at least 9 grams of protein per serving to your morning meal: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Getting enough protein, fiber and healthy fats at breakfast is key for keeping you fueled, focused and ready to conquer your day. Luckily, our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/281101/overnight-quinoa-pudding/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Overnight Quinoa Pudding&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent example of how to include this trifecta in the morning, with 18 grams of protein, 9 grams of fat and 9 grams of fiber per serving. Plus, it’s a good option whether you follow a Mediterranean-inspired diet or simply need a healthy breakfast you can prep the night before.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7w5ydtj001f3b732nei3bqn@published"&gt;My wife and I are relative newcomers to anal play. We bought a butt plug to experiment. It’s a small bulb with a pretty flower flange at the end. Yesterday, after some digital penetration with lube, one finger first then a second, my wife inserted the plug and we started to have sex from behind. Everything was going great (like really great!) until I started to see the plug, flange and all, start to move inside her.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7w7cyc3004t3b73kk511fkm@published"&gt;I stopped immediately and was able to hook a finger behind the flange, but it was clearly past the external sphincter. It really hurt her when I tried to pull it back. So I just kept going on as she tried to slow her breathing and relax, both of us terrified we were seconds away from an emergency room visit we really did not want to make. Eventually, I was able to pull it back out with some discomfort. How do we make sure this never happens again, assuming we even try? Should we just use a plug with a bigger flange?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="109" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7w5ye1m001i3b73bsth4lfo@published"&gt;I don’t know why this is, but the beautiful little anal plugs—with pretty flowers, gems, and other adornments on the ends—hardly ever have a wide enough flange to be safe for use. If we lived in a different world, there might be scientific data regarding how wide a flange should be, or even detail about how wide a flange should be for what size of butthole, or—dreaming wildly here—FDA certification that confirms a flange is wide enough. But we live in this world, and so all I can say is go for a significantly larger flange-to-protrusion ratio than that of the toy which got sucked into your wife’s rectum.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7w5ye4b001j3b73pi1vue93@published"&gt;Dr. Evan Goldstein, a longtime friend of the column and anal surgeon, sells a couple of his own products along with some picks from other toy producers &lt;a href="https://shop.bespokesurgical.com/collections/dilators"&gt;on his website&lt;/a&gt;. I feel comfortable trusting the judgment of an anal surgeon with regard to whether a toy is likely to be safe for insertion. There are also some recommendations for plugs with flared handles at the &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sex/sex-toy-stuck-in-vagina-anus#tips-for-anal-toys"&gt;bottom of this article&lt;/a&gt;. That said, don’t put your full trust into any one product. It is best practice to monitor the anal plug during penetration. Your wife should be paying attention to what she feels, and you should be paying attention to what you see, so you can take any necessary action before the object is actually fully inside her rectum.&lt;/p&gt;

Go slow and use lube, of course, but the upside is that a penis—attached to the rest of a human—can’t get lost inside her intestines and require surgical removal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7w5yuzm001t3b73uqeoptam@published"&gt;I love my husband deeply and cherish our emotional connection, but sexually, I need something he struggles to give me. I crave dominance and rougher sex. My ex was dominant and in a consensual way, he would share me with two of his friends. Being with the three of them made for some of the most thrilling and deeply fulfilling years of my life. I felt desired in the most primal way, completely surrendered, utterly used, and yet worshiped at the same time. It was intoxicating. That was years ago before marriage and kids.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7w5yuzn001u3b73wwlhtn4k@published"&gt;I have come to realize that to be truly satisfied sexually, I need this feeling from my partner. My husband is very loving but too gentle. He’s tried, but the primal energy I need isn’t natural for him. We tried a male-female-male threesome but it just wasn’t the same. Since starting hormone replacement, these cravings have come back stronger than ever. I can’t suppress them, and I don’t want to stop the hormones. I’ve had thoughts about other men, but I would never cheat—I want this to be open, honest, and above board. How do I tell my husband that I need other lovers with more dominant energy while keeping our emotional connection intact?&lt;/p&gt;

No matter how carefully and kindly you phrase it, the core of what you want to express is that you crave something your husband has been unable to give you. That’s a hard thing to hear, no matter how confident and open a person is.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="37" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7w5yuzo001y3b73atx1wn4i@published"&gt;When you have to have difficult conversations, does your husband do better with ripping the band-aid off or with a slow process? Thinking back on previous successful conversations can help you tailor your approach on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="197" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7w5yuzo001z3b73pb7ldtas@published"&gt;Your opening line in this letter does a great job of starting with what you value about your husband—what he means to you, what keeps you in the relationship—and then succinctly describing the issue with a bit of nuance. I’d start there, and stop there as well. Give him the chance to respond. Give him the autonomy to make suggestions of his own. He might be open to making another effort at giving you the kind of sex you crave. There are classes, books, and online workshops at his disposal. He might be able to hire a dominant as a coach to help him find what you need inside of himself. Or, he might suggest opening things up of his own accord. The point is, don’t take his power away by coming in with a firm decision about what needs to happen next. Furthermore, you had one (lackluster) MMF threesome—would you give up on heterosexuality after one instance of bad sex with a man? I’m guessing not. So keep that option open as well. Approach this difficulty as a team, and collaborate on ideas for how the two of you might move forward while meeting your desires.&lt;/p&gt;

You can think back on how you’ve successfully approached difficult issues in the past, and on specific approaches that have gone poorly, to get an idea of how to set yourself up for success, but you’re taking a risk. One of the real tests of a relationship is how you recover and repair from upset. So, while you’re thinking back on previous conversations, take a moment to note ways you’ve had success de-escalating situations that became emotionally heightened. Basically, these examples are all tools you have at your disposal—having them top of mind will hopefully remind you to use them as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

You don’t really give much information in your letter, so I don’t have an exact template for you. But leading with the love and regard you have for her, being as succinct as possible about the difficult part, and balancing directness with kindness will serve you well.&lt;/p&gt;

For instance, between 1998 and 2018, autism diagnoses jumped by 787 percent in the UK alone; &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/pill-kills-ticks-lyme-disease-babesiosis-anaplasmosis/"&gt;Lyme disease&lt;/a&gt; has an estimated 85 percent overdiagnosis rate, including in countries where it’s impossible to contract the disease; and there’s still little evidence that many &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/cancer/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; screening programs actually reduce cancer-related death rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Ahead of her keynote speech at &lt;a href="https://health.wired.com/"&gt;WIRED Health&lt;/a&gt; later this month, O’Sullivan spoke to WIRED to talk about the boundaries between illness and health, the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/nocebo-effect"&gt;nocebo effect&lt;/a&gt;, and the dangers of early detection. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-hnJNtl gxMaIG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WIRED: You’ve been a neurologist for nearly 35 years. When did you start seeing this new phenomenon of overdiagnosis?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suzanne O’Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; In the book I write about Darcy, a young lady who came to me with seizures. She’s only 24 and she had ten other diagnoses. I’m an epilepsy specialist, and that should mean that I’m only seeing people with epilepsy, but unfortunately seizures are a thing that happen very frequently for psychosomatic reasons. When I started, people came to me with seizures that had a psychological cause. That’s all they had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn efJA-DB callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;But over the course of the last ten years, that particular group of patients started to gather a long list of diagnoses. What seems to be happening now is that if you go to different doctors with multiple symptoms, you will get a name for them all. These symptoms always existed, but the naming of them has been detrimental to patients. It’s caused them to pay a lot of attention to their bodies and that makes the symptoms worse. That’s the nocebo effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Every week now I see at least one Darcy, a 24-year old with different medical labels. Most of those labels have no treatment and aren’t making them better. That’s a very concerning trend for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are doctors over-labeling symptoms rather than trying to get to the root cause of the disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;We did have an underdiagnosis problem in the past, particularly with learning or behavioral problems such as &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/autism/"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; and ADHD. We didn’t recognize people who needed help, so we’ve been trying to correct that. But we’ve overcorrected. We have been working on the assumption that the more we diagnose, the healthier you can make the population. That was probably true to a point, but the improvement isn’t sustained when you get into the milder end of any disease spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Patients come to us wanting answers. People want to understand why they are the way they are. A satisfying consultation between a doctor and a patient is often one where the patient asks about a symptom and the doctor can explain what it is. I think it’s a little bit of a collusion between what patients want and how doctors can satisfy them with labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The increase in the diagnosis rates for ADHD and autism, in particular, have exploded over the past decade. Is this the result of the shifting boundaries between what we now consider to be health and sickness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;That’s my concern. Autism has risen from like one in 2,500 people to one in 36 children in the UK and one in 20 in Northern Ireland. That happened because people realized that there must be kids out there who’ve got milder forms of this, and if we help them, they’ll get better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 17:04:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOY3JrV0VDZDhUWnRPUDgzc2ZLdzN5b2txTWdrdDlBaThFWHQ3amMtUGdlZ0ljZ2pvMHNwR21pSjZRLUlVTXdMdkdRdWh2UDBGNHFSMWxQVlA2UFd1cFhyamVOTnBycjBNanZkUTZKdjlJdTd1RkVPNnRBZkRqNFZjenRteG95bjJvVXFUSGdEUnJiUWRJOVdjUXNpaXh4cGxtbU5NQk10NA</guid></item><item><title>Berberine Is Being Called ‘Nature’s Ozempic’—Does It Really Work for Weight Loss? - Verywell Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE94cTYzbXkySGxzcDFpYlp0eG02RUpySHNiRDBaYjgwc0hzOUJJR0czT0pEREhIaEJvSE1QMzBOaVBfWmNUNE0td1RhRnE0cVNmNFY4TUtxbTFiNWRseC05VkxTd2FJWUlrNE8xNzZkeGZ3QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-page_1-0" class="comp health-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content article-content expert-content right-rail__offset lock-journey" data-sc-sticky-offset="60" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[400, 1400, 1400, 1700, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The supplement berberine is being touted as a natural alternative to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/ozempic-semaglutide-uses-efficacy-side-effects-7489260" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;, a prescription medication used to stabilize blood sugar and aid in weight loss for people with type 2 diabetes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Social media users claim berberine can lower blood sugar, improve insulin sensitivity, and even promote weight loss. Some even say it could be a viable option for people who can't access Ozempic or Wegovy. Is berberine really an effective weight loss supplement?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-is-berberine-really-natures-ozempic"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Is Berberine Really 'Nature's Ozempic'? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Berberine is a natural compound called an alkaloid that’s extracted from a variety of plants, including goldenseal, European barberry, Oregon grape, phellodendron, and tree turmeric. However, it does not have the same effect as Ozempic, said &lt;a href="https://pharmacy.ucsf.edu/lisa-kroon" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lisa Kroon, PharmD&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the Department of Clinical Pharmacy in the School of Pharmacy at the University of California in San Francisco.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s absolutely not nature’s Ozempic and does not work like Ozempic, which is a GLP-1 inhibitor,” Kroon said. “Manufacturers of these supplements are just kind of creating a hype to try to be appealing for people looking for a magic potion to help them lose weight.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ozempic, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, helps the pancreas release insulin when blood sugar is high, lowering glucose levels. GLP-1 medications also help slow gastric emptying, which can reduce appetite and lead to weight loss.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Berberine doesn’t work anything like that; it is a completely different mechanism," Kroon said. Berberine activates an enzyme called AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which can help regulate glucose metabolism, improve insulin sensitivity, and impact blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the drugstore supplement has recently increased in popularity due to social media, it's been used for centuries, especially in Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine, said &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mir B Ali, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, providers may recommend berberine for people with diabetes to help lower their blood sugar and cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;“It has also been shown to have some antimicrobial effects so it can affect the normal intestinal bacteria,” Ali said.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-can-berberine-help-with-weight-loss"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Can Berberine Help With Weight Loss? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although berberine may help reduce blood sugar and cholesterol levels, it’s not clear if the supplement is effective for weight loss, Ali said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There's no real evidence to show that berberine is the equivalent of GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. “It was shown to have some modest amount of effect on weight loss, but it’s not the same effect as the prescribed medications," Ali added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Still, a bit of research on berberine’s effectiveness for weight loss and diabetes does exist. One meta-analysis of 27 studies found that the supplement may be just as effective as certain oral diabetes medications, such as metformin and glipizide, when it comes to blood glucose control.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A small 2012 study involving seven participants with obesity found that those who took 500 milligrams of berberine three times per day for 12 weeks lost on average 5 pounds of weight.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; More recently, a review of 12 studies in 2020 suggested that berberine supplements can potentially impact body weight, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/is-being-a-little-overweight-ok-bmi-controversy-1746304" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;body mass index (BMI)&lt;/a&gt;, and belly fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; More research is needed to draw meaningful conclusions about whether berberine is effective for weight loss.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “I don’t think berberine would be harmful for the majority of patients, but it’s still not clear how effective it is for weight loss,” Ali said. “I think it’s reasonable to try it as a supplement to healthy lifestyle and diet changes, but I don’t want people to think that it’s the equivalent of prescribed medications.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-is-berberine-safe"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Is Berberine Safe? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some people who use berberine may experience minor side effects, including diarrhea, constipation, nausea, bloating, and other gastrointestinal issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Berberine does appear to be safe for adults to use in the short term. But long-term use has not been studied and some animal studies report some severe side effects with long-term berberine use like enlarged liver/kidneys, muscle tremors, and gastric ulcers," &lt;a href="https://www.topnutritioncoaching.com/nutritionists/megan-hilbert" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Megan Hilbert, MS, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian specializing in gut health nutrition at Top Nutrition Coaching, told Verywell in an email.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kroon said it's important to remember that these supplements are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and have not been studied on a large scale.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy are FDA-regulated and well-studied for indications like diabetes or weight loss, whereas nutritional supplements like berberine are not FDA-regulated,” Kroon said. “I would really advise not to jump on the bandwagon here and think that berberine is going to work like a prescription medicine, because it’s not going to. You could be spending a good $50+ out of pocket.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say people who use berberine may not see the same results as prescription medications intended for weight loss. Before trying berberine, consult with your healthcare provider, especially if you have certain health conditions like diabetes or are taking other medications and supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Some of the strongest associations were seen in circulatory, endocrine, metabolic, and musculoskeletal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most pronounced findings was that genetically predicted taller height increases the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/fda-approves-cutting-edge-atrial-fibrillation-afib-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt;, a heart condition that causes irregular and often rapid heartbeat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This association was the strongest when analyzing data across all ancestry groups. Taller individuals also showed a higher risk of venous thromboembolism, a condition where blood clots form in veins, which can be life-threatening if they travel to the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also confirmed that taller individuals have a lower likelihood of developing coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. These conditions affect heart health, and previous studies have suggested similar links. However, this study reinforced these findings using a large, multi-ancestry dataset, increasing confidence in the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="height_and_ancestry_specific_disease_patterns"&gt;Height and Ancestry-Specific Disease Patterns&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many associations held true across different ancestry groups, some were unique to specific populations or genders. For example, taller height in males was linked to a lower risk of hyperpotassemia, a condition characterized by &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/baked-potatoes-can-boost-your-heart-health-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high potassium levels&lt;/a&gt; in the blood. However, this association was not seen in females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another ancestry-specific pattern emerged regarding anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In the European ancestry meta-analysis, increased genetically predicted height in males was associated with a reduced risk of these mental health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Estimates per ancestry in the male meta-analysis of Phenome Wide Association Studies (meta-PheWAS), for signals from the mental disorders category that were identified as significant only in the European males meta PheWAS.

A higher genetically predicted height was linked to an increased risk of benign neoplasms in the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/why-did-human-brains-grow-so-big-the-surprising-link-to-our-gut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;digestive system&lt;/a&gt;, a connection that did not appear in the overall, sex-combined analysis. This suggests that hormonal or metabolic differences between men and women may influence the relationship between height and certain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="genetic_insights_from_a_massive_global_dataset"&gt;Genetic Insights from a Massive Global Dataset&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To carry out the study, the research team built a polygenic score for height using data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This score included genetic variants from the GIANT consortium, one of the largest sources of genetic data on height. The researchers excluded data from 23andMe to ensure consistency. By applying the PheWAS method, they systematically identified unexpected links between height and disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Top 20 significant hits from the sex-combined cross-ancestry PheWAS meta-analysis of EUR, AFR, EAS, HIS.

We report associations with a series of disorders, involving mental disorders and the endocrine system, that have not been previously associated with genetically predicted height.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eirini Marouli, an associate professor in computational biology at Queen Mary University of London and the study’s senior author, emphasized the significance of these findings: “Our study reveals significant links between genetically predicted height and various health conditions, providing new perspectives on disease risk. As a complex trait, height’s associations with disease offer valuable insights into underlying biological mechanisms. By analyzing genetic data across diverse ancestries and incorporating sex-specific analyses, we have identified associations that could improve early diagnosis and patient care. This research underscores the importance of inclusive &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-find-genetic-link-between-heart-disease-and-brain-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;genetic studies&lt;/a&gt;, advancing our understanding of health across populations and ensuring that scientific progress benefits everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="implications_for_medicine_and_future_research"&gt;Implications for Medicine and Future Research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight the importance of considering height when assessing disease risk. Understanding how genetic height influences medical conditions could improve early diagnosis and preventative strategies. While height is not something that can be changed, its genetic associations may help doctors tailor health screenings and treatments based on individual risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Heterogeneous traits in the cross-ancestry meta-PheWAS analysis.

Many past studies focused primarily on European ancestry, limiting their applicability to other populations. By including multiple ancestries, this research provides a broader perspective on how genetic height impacts health worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research may focus on understanding the biological mechanisms driving these associations. For example, why does taller height protect against certain &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-mri-scan-can-identify-patients-at-risk-for-serious-heart-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart conditions&lt;/a&gt; while increasing the risk for others? Are these effects influenced by environmental factors like diet and lifestyle? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answering these questions could pave the way for more personalized medicine, where genetic risk factors inform prevention and treatment plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Brighter Side of News</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 16:26:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQZ1JLRWxWYnRsazhWSFVVZUhKNlRVdGVGUXpNQm1lV0FOOEtLXzBmVmpCZkFuMWstUU80Y0NZc0pwM2o1cUw3bDEza2dQaVBENEdRLS1LMFJvOVBMVkNwVHhtTy1tZkE0eE1zbVBNTTJtenBzdlB3X1M4dGhoekhxVV92Qk1hdV9CXzRlcVUwQ29QeWRQc3dLNjFSblJ6dVZvTm9FUVFhLTVoR28</guid></item><item><title>NIH-funded research team engineers new drug targeting pain sensation pathway - National Institutes of Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFBVV95cUxPVHp0ZVYtSG9lVkVKS2JIRnN4NTVtZzNyd0NfcnMtNV9ITVVmSk5zeFQ2Sjg1YWlKV29sUXJ2WEl6dGsxNzl1bE5xSGNUZWRoNTJIdko1ZUR6cXl6Q250OUdTQnJENDVRZkp6MkRUOGN1alVVOUhrX211SXFvajhsODZMMUZTSVNhY01nQ0M5aEVieDlHX3UyWUNYc1l5aXpTLWFNaUg0RnRsWDdkbjVjZ2hrS3JRMVJJZm50RVBPWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;
Study of CB1 receptor has implications for chronic pain treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A research team funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed a medication that shows promise in treating acute and chronic pain. The drug, known as VIP36, targets the body’s cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1). It was found to be effective in three different animal models for pain and does not appear to cause the harmful side effects that have frustrated other efforts to target CB1. These results enhance understanding of how to design safer and more effective drugs targeting cannabinoid receptors and are an important step towards developing novel, non-addictive treatments for pain.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;CB1 receptors can be found throughout the body and are particularly dense in the brain’s pain circuitry. They have long been considered a potential target for non-opioid-based pain treatment; however, previous attempts to target this pathway have been met with two challenges. First, repeated exposure to a drug leads to tolerance that limits its efficacy. Second, the dose required to reduce pain in the periphery tends to be high enough for the drug to make its way into the central nervous system. In humans, this can cause unwanted changes in mood, cognition, or emotional state.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;To overcome these issues, researchers leveraged computer modeling of the CB1 receptor to design molecules that better interact with CB1, much like a key fitting into a lock.  The newly designed drug, VIP36, is more “peripherally restricted” compared to previous drugs, meaning that much less of it leaks into the central nervous system where it can cause unwanted side effects. VIP36 also interacts with CB1 differently than treatments tested previously and in a way that reduces tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;CB1 is part of a wide-ranging class of receptors known as G-protein-coupled receptors, which are involved in countless functions throughout the body including smell, vision, mood regulation, immune system responses, autonomic nervous system responses such as blood pressure and heart rate, and growth and metastasis of some tumors. In addition to their implications in pain care, the findings of this study could also help spur the design of other drugs that target similar receptors involved in other conditions.       &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;This research was funded by NIH’s &lt;a href="https://heal.nih.gov"&gt;Helping to End Addiction Long-term® Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, or NIH HEAL Initiative®, an NIH-wide effort that seeks to speed scientific solutions to the overdose epidemic, including opioid and stimulant use disorders, and the crisis of chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;

showed people who were already taking a daily aspirin were more likely to survive if they were diagnosed with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But how?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It appears to centre on a moment of vulnerability for a cancer - when a lone cell breaks off from the original tumour and tries, like a seed on the wind, to spread elsewhere in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This process is called metastasis and is the cause of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-020-0134-x" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;the majority of deaths&lt;/a&gt; from cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Part of our immune defences - a white blood cell called a T-cell - can swoop in and destroy the spreading cancer as it tries to take root.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But the study showed that another part of our blood - the platelets that normally stop bleeding - were suppressing the T-cells and making it harder for them to take out the cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Aspirin disrupts the platelets and removes their influence over the T-cells so they can hunt out the cancer.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prof Rahul Roychoudhuri, from the University of Cambridge, told me: "What we've discovered is that aspirin might work, surprisingly, by unleashing the power of the immune system to recognize and kill metastasizing cancer cells."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He thinks the drug would work best in cancers that have been caught early and could be used after treatment such as surgery to help the immune system find any cancer that might already have spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Should I take aspirin for cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The most natural question for anybody with cancer to ask is should they be taking aspirin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If you are a cancer patient, don't rush to your local pharmacy to buy aspirin just yet, but actively consider participation in ongoing or upcoming trials of aspirin," says Prof Mangesh Thorat, a surgeon and cancer researcher at Queen Mary University of London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He says the study provided "the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle" in understanding how aspirin works, but there were still questions to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Aspirin can cause dangerous internal bleeding including strokes so the risks have to be balanced. It is also not clear whether the effect works for all cancer or just specific ones. And this is still animal research so while the scientists think this would apply in people that will still need to be confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some patients - with Lynch syndrome, which increases the risk of cancers - are already &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng151/chapter/Recommendations" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;recommended aspirin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But it will still take proper clinical trials to understand whether more patients would benefit too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;These are already under way. Prof Ruth Langley, from the MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University College London, is leading the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.addaspirintrial.org/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Add-Aspirin trial&lt;/a&gt; to see if aspirin can stop early stage cancers from coming back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She said the study's results were "an important discovery" as they would help to work out "who is most likely to benefit from aspirin after a cancer diagnosis".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, she again warned of the risks of taking aspirin and to "always talk to your doctor before starting".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In the long-run, Prof Roychoudhuri suspects new drugs would be developed that take the benefits of aspirin, but with fewer of the risky side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Eureka moment'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The discovery, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08626-7" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;published in the journal Nature&lt;/a&gt;, happened by accident as the scientists were not researching aspirin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The team in Cambridge were investigating how the immune system responded to cancers when they spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They were using genetically engineered mice and found those lacking a specific set of genetic instructions were less likely to get metastatic cancer that had spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Further investigation revealed how those T-cells were being suppressed and this started to overlap with how aspirin was known to work in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Jie Yang, who carried out the research, said: "It was a Eureka moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It was an entirely unexpected finding which sent us down quite a different path of inquiry than we had anticipated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 16:03:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9VakJpOVJKRW5BSlcxOTBTTlVSVFZoZ20tWkZRQUtKenFGakdCMmhwUkxoRFRJVkRSZ2laWEhGQmZPLS1zVTgzVko0aldlV0trRkF5ZXB0U2tTd9IBX0FVX3lxTFBvOVRpazVTYWNtUlRWMUhiUW5OX25Pd3dZNW5zTWZwRlNXNWhvWHBmTzZTUFh5bEMxRi1pblp0LWFKdVpaMGlQNVlqcUpPTWVhVmwwTnRONVNnbkdrYzdn</guid></item><item><title>Scientists discover how aspirin could prevent some cancers from spreading - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE9xTzRHQWRWeDBGMFVoX01jOG4wak5vTUZZTnBqbjlCbHRNM1dKNm9aZktaZTV3NlRrcjlldHNjeXltOEpJdmhoSURzNXVMU0F0cWJUaGkwLUZHcWhWNUZRWW1venNhb1BPcnZ6WDJDdEFtcXBVUnZtNjdR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have uncovered the mechanism behind how aspirin could reduce the metastasis of some cancers by stimulating the immune system. In the study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08626-7" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists say that discovering the mechanism will support ongoing clinical trials, and could lead to the targeted use of aspirin to prevent the spread of susceptible types of cancer, and to the development of more effective drugs to prevent cancer metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The scientists caution that, in some people, aspirin can have serious side effects and clinical trials are underway to determine how to use it safely and effectively to prevent cancer spread, so people should consult their doctor before starting to take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies of people with cancer have previously observed that those taking daily &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/low-dose+aspirin/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;low-dose aspirin&lt;/a&gt; have a reduction in the spread of some cancers, such as breast, bowel, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/prostate+cancers/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;prostate cancers&lt;/a&gt;, leading to ongoing clinical trials. However, until now it wasn't known exactly how aspirin could prevent metastases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, led by researchers at the University of Cambridge, the scientists say their discovery of how aspirin reduces cancer metastasis was serendipitous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were investigating the process of metastasis, because, while cancer starts out in one location, 90% of cancer deaths occur when cancer spreads to other parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists wanted to better understand how the immune system responds to metastasis, because when individual cancer cells break away from their originating tumor and spread to another part of the body they are particularly vulnerable to immune attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immune system can recognize and kill these lone cancer cells more effectively than cancer cells within larger originating tumors, which have often developed an environment that suppresses the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The researchers previously screened 810 genes in mice and found 15 that had an effect on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+metastasis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer metastasis&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, they found that mice lacking a gene which produces a protein called ARHGEF1 had less metastasis of various primary cancers to the lungs and liver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers determined that ARHGEF1 suppresses a type of immune cell called a T cell, which can recognize and kill metastatic cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To develop treatments to take advantage of this discovery, they needed to find a way for drugs to target it. The scientists traced signals in the cell to determine that ARHGEF1 is switched on when T cells are exposed to a clotting factor called thromboxane A2 (TXA2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an unexpected revelation for the scientists, because TXA2 is already well-known and linked to how aspirin works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TXA2 is produced by platelets—a cell in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+stream/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood stream&lt;/a&gt; that helps blood clot, preventing wounds from bleeding, but occasionally causing heart attacks and strokes. Aspirin reduces the production of TXA2, leading to the anti-clotting effects which underlie its ability to prevent heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new research found that aspirin prevents cancers from spreading by decreasing TXA2 and releasing T cells from suppression. They used a mouse model of melanoma to show that in mice given aspirin, the frequency of metastases was reduced compared to control mice, and this was dependent on releasing T cells from suppression by TXA2.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Professor Rahul Roychoudhuri, from the University of Cambridge, who led the study, said, "Despite advances in cancer treatment, many patients with early-stage cancers receive treatments, such as surgical removal of the tumor, which have the potential to be curative, but later relapse due to the eventual growth of micrometastases—cancer cells that have seeded other parts of the body but remain in a latent state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most immunotherapies are developed to treat patients with established metastatic cancer, but when cancer first spreads there's a unique therapeutic window of opportunity when cancer cells are particularly vulnerable to immune attack. We hope that therapies that target this window of vulnerability will have tremendous scope in preventing recurrence in patients with early cancer at risk of recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jie Yang, who carried out the research at the University of Cambridge, said, "It was a Eureka moment when we found TXA2 was the molecular signal that activates this suppressive effect on T cells. Before this, we had not been aware of the implications of our findings in understanding the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin. It was an entirely unexpected finding which sent us down quite a different path of inquiry than we had anticipated."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Aspirin, or other drugs that could target this pathway, have the potential to be less expensive than antibody-based therapies, and therefore more accessible globally."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers plan to help the translation of their work into potential clinical practice by collaborating with Professor Ruth Langley, of the MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University College London, who is leading the &lt;a href="https://www.addaspirintrial.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Add-Aspirin clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;, to find out if aspirin can stop or delay early stage cancers from coming back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Langley, who was not involved in this study, commented, "This is an important discovery. It will enable us to interpret the results of ongoing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; and work out who is most likely to benefit from aspirin after a cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In a small proportion of people, aspirin can cause serious side effects, including bleeding or stomach ulcers. Therefore, it is important to understand which people with cancer are likely to benefit and always talk to your doctor before starting aspirin."&lt;/p&gt;

(PA Archive)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by the University of Cambridge, it suggests a path for aspirin to become a cancer treatment, alongside the development of more effective drugs to prevent cancer spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers screened 810 genes in mice and found 15 that had an effect on cancer spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, they found that mice lacking a gene which produces a protein called ARHGEF1 were less likely to have cancer spread to the lungs and liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts discovered that ARHGEF1 suppresses a type of immune cell called a T cell, which is important for recognising and killing metastatic (spreading to other parts of the body) cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that ARHGEF1 is switched on when T cells are exposed to a clotting factor called thromboxane A2 (TXA2) – this was an unexpected finding for the scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TXA2 is produced by platelets in the blood and aspirin is already known to cut the production of TXA2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research found that aspirin can prevent cancers from spreading by decreasing TXA2 – releasing T cells from being suppressed so they can kill cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice given aspirin, the frequency of metastases was reduced compared with mice not on the drug, and this was dependent on releasing T cells from suppression by TXA2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Rahul Roychoudhuri, from the University of Cambridge, who led the study, said: “Despite advances in cancer treatment, many patients with early stage cancers receive treatments, such as surgical removal of the tumour, which have the potential to be curative, but later relapse due to the eventual growth of micrometastases – cancer cells that have seeded other parts of the body but remain in a latent state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most immunotherapies are developed to treat patients with established metastatic cancer, but when cancer first spreads there’s a unique therapeutic window of opportunity when cancer cells are particularly vulnerable to immune attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope that therapies that target this window of vulnerability will have tremendous scope in preventing recurrence in patients with early cancer at risk of recurrence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Jie Yang, also from the University of Cambridge, said: “It was a Eureka moment when we found TXA2 was the molecular signal that activates this suppressive effect on T cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before this, we had not been aware of the implication of our findings in understanding the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was an entirely unexpected finding which sent us down quite a different path of inquiry than we had anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aspirin, or other drugs that could target this pathway, have the potential to be less expensive than antibody-based therapies, and therefore more accessible globally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now working with Professor Ruth Langley at University College London, who is leading the Add-Aspirin clinical trial, to find out if aspirin can stop or delay early stage cancers from coming back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trial, supported by Cancer Research UK, includes patients with breast, oesophageal, stomach, prostate and bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Langley said of the new work: “This is an important discovery. It will enable us to interpret the results of ongoing clinical trials and work out who is most likely to benefit from aspirin after a cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a small proportion of people, aspirin can cause serious side-effects, including bleeding or stomach ulcers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Therefore, it is important to understand which people with cancer are likely to benefit, and always talk to your doctor before starting aspirin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Melcher, professor of translation immunotherapy at the Institute of Cancer Research, London, said the side-effects of aspirin are not trivial – such as stomach bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: “This new research may help to design better, more targeted drugs, that interfere with the mechanism discovered here to do the good things that aspirin does, without the harmful side-effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanya Hollands, research information manager at Cancer Research UK, said further work is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added: “At the moment, there are no national guidelines for the general population to take aspirin to prevent or treat cancer…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cancer Research UK is funding similar research, including the Add-Aspirin trial, the world’s largest clinical trial designed to look at aspirin as a way to stop cancer coming back after receiving cancer treatment. We look forward to seeing how research develops in this area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPclZNaDhGM19ZMjZGamN2S2puejV5V0lxeU1PWHBhN3BQOXpxX2FCQ0Y1MWc2SHNVOG94dnlKd29QaDhMczBfSDdvRGJyX3IzNTN3MWFHUVBKd05sYk1XVkc1REZHMDNkNVhHZDh0YlZNVzRsRlUyVjkzLWdSMWFPYmFTVFlhaHlQcWFkYmtTSkE4RmppbGNLSWw2YjU2TGRaV1hMOEYyQThYWTJL</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Identify Critical “Midlife Window” for Preventing Age-Related Brain Decline - Stony Brook News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3AFBVV95cUxQdWhHTlJqYmNGX3hzU213Z1B5VnBnZ2xoTEdLUDhfQ1p0cjFuVVFGbzhVNjNsbkhQaF80Njg5cEVvMWdSdWJrUU1XakVVbWo3b3phQTVkbUFDcWJMaG96akxMcDlxUW5iRUI4YjRfVG9HQXdZR3BYYzdZaFF2VFl5cjhDRXh5b2xKbkV6OWNDbWFCdlRVeUJEOHF3b0hlaUZROE5LNEJOMDc5emxPQTcyRU90cXlZZnFqSGNGeWpFbDhyRWxwNGJWUmNfOHNFRVZFMXVqUXhMNHBycXF5?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ve identified a critical midlife window where the brain begins to experience declining access to energy but before irreversible damage occurs, essentially the ‘bend’ before the ‘break.’ During midlife, neurons are metabolically stressed due to insufficient fuel; they’re struggling, but they’re still viable,” She explains. “Therefore, providing an alternative fuel during this critical window can help restore function. However, by later ages, neurons’ prolonged starvation may have triggered a cascade of other physiological effects that make intervention less effective.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers not only mapped this aging trajectory but identified its primary driver: neuronal insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparing metabolic, vascular, and inflammatory biomarkers, they found that metabolic changes consistently preceded vascular and inflammatory ones. Gene expression analyses further implicated the insulin-dependent glucose transporter GLUT4 and the lipid transport protein APOE (a known Alzheimer’s risk factor) in these aging patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these same gene expression analyses also identified the neuronal ketone transporter MCT2 as a potential protective factor, suggesting that enhancing the brain’s ability to utilize ketones—an alternative brain fuel that neurons can metabolize without insulin—might be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding of the ketone transporter then motivated an interventional study, in which researchers compared administration of individually weight-dosed and calorically matched glucose and ketones to 101 participants at different stages along the aging trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects were striking in this cohort. Unlike glucose, ketones effectively stabilized deteriorating brain networks, but with effects that differed significantly across critical transition points. Ketones showed moderate benefits in young adults (20-39 years), showed maximum benefits during the midlife “metabolic stress” period (40-59 years) after which networks begin destabilizing, but had diminished impact in older adults (60-79 years) once the network destabilization hit maximum acceleration and the domination of compounding vascular effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mujica-Parodi and co-authors say that these findings could revolutionize approaches to preventing age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current treatments typically target symptoms after they appear, often too late for meaningful intervention. This research suggests that metabolic intervention – whether through dietary approaches like ketogenic diets or supplements—might be most effective when started in one’s 40s, well before cognitive symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This represents a paradigm shift in how we think about brain aging prevention,” notes Botond Antal, PhD, Postdoctoral Associate in Biomedical Engineering at Stony Brook and first author. “Rather than waiting for cognitive symptoms, which may not appear until substantial damage has occurred, we can potentially identify people at risk through neurometabolic markers and intervene during this critical window.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a public health standpoint, these findings could inform new screening guidelines and preventive approaches, emphasizes Mujica-Parodi. Early (mid-life) identification of increasing insulin resistance in the brain (not just the blood), coupled with targeted metabolic interventions, might substantially delay cognitive aging for millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the global population aging rapidly and dementia cases projected to triple by 2050, these insights into the timing and mechanisms of brain aging offer new hope for preventive strategies that could maintain cognitive health well into later life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the W. M. Keck Foundation and the National Science Foundation (NSF) Brain Research through Advancing Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work was completed by scientists from Stony Brook University, in collaboration with those at Massachusetts General Hospital, Mayo Clinic, Oxford University, and Memorial Sloan Kettering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;abbr class="drop-cap color-accent font-accent"&gt;E&lt;/abbr&gt;ach year hundreds of children&lt;/strong&gt; are born legally blind because of a genetic disorder that degrades their retinas. Though some can distinguish between light and dark early on, a defect in their AIPL1 gene leaves most without sight by the time they turn four. The disorder has long been considered irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s no longer true. A new gene therapy from publicly traded company MeiraGTx has managed to do something unprecedented: It’s given eyesight to 11 children who were born blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgeons at Great Ormond Street Hospital and the Evelina London Children’s Hospital injected the retinas of kids born with the AIPL1 defect with an MeiraGTx therapy that introduces a correct version of the gene, which causes their bodies to produce the mechanisms that enable sight. Within weeks they were able to see for the first time. Now, years later they all are capable of reading, coloring and playing like other children with the aid of glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These were blind kids and now they run around and find rooms. They can read letters. They can read numbers,” said Zandy Forbes, 60, the founder and CEO of MeiraGTx. The therapy is one of several the company is working on to treat eye-related disorders and other conditions such as Parkinson’s, obesity and xerostomia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the initial study, which &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02812-5/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02812-5/fulltext" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02812-5/fulltext" aria-label="was published"&gt;was published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; last week, four children with the disorder were given the therapy in one eye each. Within a month, the treated eye began to see again. It could identify colors, shapes, and letters and follow moving objects. There were no significant side effects. Encouraged by this success, the hospitals gave the therapy to seven more children, this time in both eyes. All seven had their eyesight restored. Given the strength of these initial results, MeiraGTx is pursuing regulatory approval in the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forbes, who is not related to the Forbes media family, started MeiraGTx in 2015 after leaving her role as an SVP of commercial operations at pharmaceutical company Kadmon (which has since been acquired by Sanofi). The company raised a total of about $110 million in venture capital from investors including University College London’s Technology Fund, ID Fund, and Perceptive Advisors before going public in 2018 with an IPO that raised $75 million.

Pharma giant Sanofi also &lt;a href="https://investors.meiragtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/meiragtx-announces-30-million-strategic-investment-sanofi" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://investors.meiragtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/meiragtx-announces-30-million-strategic-investment-sanofi" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://investors.meiragtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/meiragtx-announces-30-million-strategic-investment-sanofi" aria-label="made a $30 million investment"&gt;made a $30 million investment&lt;/a&gt; in MeiraGTx in 2023 in exchange for a right of first negotiation for several of its drug candidates, bringing its total investment in the company to $60 million. The company has about $120 million in cash which gives it runway through 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene therapies often require complicated procedures to deliver them. Forbes has made it a point to focus on the development of ones that are both easy to administer and treat both genetic diseases and other maladies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, the company has focused on low-dose treatments, which lowers the risk of side effects. Like most gene therapies, its treatments are delivered to patients using specially modified viruses called “adeno-associated viruses” (AAVs), essentially a type of cold virus that has the infectious part of the virus removed and replaced with whatever medicine needs to be delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unlike other gene therapy companies, MeiraGTx is vertically integrated, and has built commercial-ready manufacturing facilities so it doesn’t have to rely on contractors to make its gene therapies. That has enabled the company to rapidly complete clinical studies, said Forbes, who named the company for the Hebrew word for “giving light.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After its IPO, where shares were priced at $15 per share, MeiraGTx’s stock soared. Like many early-stage biotech stocks, it peaked during the pandemic years–almost doubling its IPO price. But it also suffered the same post-pandemic slump impacting a number of early-stage biotechs. At market close on Tuesday, it was trading at $6.68, giving it a market cap of about $522 million, which is up about 7% year to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, investment bank Chardan named MeiraGTx as one of its top 25 biotech stock picks for the year. In a research note published about the announcement, analyst Daniil Gaaulin at investment bank Chardan wrote, “We believe the strength of the data, which we find transformative … substantially de-risk the path to the U.K. approval and lay a foundation for favorable regulatory discussions with the FDA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaaulin has set a price target for the stock at $36. Other analysts have also rated the stock a buy and consider it underpriced because they expect that its AIPL1 treatment will be approved soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the APL1 treatment, MeiraGTx is developing several other gene therapies for inherited retinal disorders, which have all progressed to human testing. It’s working on a treatment for head and neck cancer patients whose salivary glands were damaged by radiation therapy, where they are injected with the genes to produce saliva again. It’s also developing a proprietary way to more precisely deliver drugs like gene therapies and peptide therapeutics (which include GLP-1s like Ozempic). These drugs are typically injected into the body or infused via IV, flooding the bloodstream with a higher dose of drugs which can increase the risks of side effects. Precise delivery allows for lower doses, which mitigates risk and has the potential to reduce cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major company focus is gene therapy to treat Parkinson’s. Here, its treatment stimulates production of a neurotransmitter called Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. Low levels of GABA are thought to be one cause of the disease. In a small study the company &lt;a href="https://investors.meiragtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/meiragtx-announces-positive-data-randomized-sham-controlled" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://investors.meiragtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/meiragtx-announces-positive-data-randomized-sham-controlled" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://investors.meiragtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/meiragtx-announces-positive-data-randomized-sham-controlled" aria-label="published last year"&gt;published last year&lt;/a&gt; that has not yet been peer reviewed, a high dose of the therapy improved motor function and quality of life in patients who received it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this data in hand, Forbes said, her company will be pursuing a larger clinical trial later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;hr class="custom-gradient-background my-6 h-[6px] max-w-[75px] border-0"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A recent outbreak of measles in West Texas has resulted in 159 cases of the disease in the state so far; 22 victims required hospitalization, and one has died.  In response to the deadly outbreak, some Texas parents seem to be considering hosting "&lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/03/03/texas-health-official-warns-against-measles-parties-amid-pleas-for-more-vaccinations/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;measles parties&lt;/a&gt;" instead of vaccinating their kids. Misinformation about measles can have deadly consequences, so here's a look at some ways people are getting measles wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="myth-measles-vaccines-are-potentially-dangerous"&gt;Myth: Measles vaccines are potentially dangerous&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4447805/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;small percentage of people suffer side effects&lt;/a&gt; from the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, they are almost always mild. The most common is a fever that hits between 5% and 10% of those vaccinated. About 2% to 5% develop a mild rash, and about 1 in 4,000 develop something more serious. The "side effects" of contracting the disease itself, on the other hand, are much worse: Nearly 100% of people who contract the disease develop symptoms that include fever, red eyes, a sore throat, and a blotchy rash. About one in 300 people who get measles will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="myth-the-measles-vaccine-gives-people-measles"&gt;Myth: The measles vaccine &lt;em&gt;gives&lt;/em&gt; people measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The belief that measles outbreaks are caused&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by the measles vaccine is growing in certain circles, helped along by advocates like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Health_Defense" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Children's Health Defense,&lt;/a&gt; the anti-vaccine advocacy group founded by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine works by introducing a weakened form of the measles virus into the body to trigger an immune response. So the theory goes, people who have been injected with the measles vaccine are infecting others with the disease. But while the measles virus can potentially be detected in people for up to four weeks after a shot, it is extremely unlikely for the virus to be be transmitted to anyone in that weakened form—which is significant, given measles itself is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/resources/contagious-infographic.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;among the most contagious diseases&lt;/a&gt;. As for the Texas outbreak specifically, to make sure, all cases have been tested, and they've all been declared to be &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/texas-measles-outbreak-anti-vaccine-advocates-blame-shot-rcna193478" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;the result of "wild" measles&lt;/a&gt;. No one got it from vaccine "shedding," because that doesn't really happen with the measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="myth-the-measles-vaccine-is-linked-to-autism"&gt;Myth: The measles vaccine is linked to autism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine for measles has been around since 1963. It has prevented countless cases of the diseases and has long been proven safe and effective. But people are still hesitant to take it and/or give it to their children. The belief that the measles vaccine, or any vaccine, can cause autism is one of the reasons. A &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/1-4-us-adults-mistakenly-believe-mmr-vaccine-causes-autism-survey-reveals" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;recent survey&lt;/a&gt; conducted by the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center, found that 24% of Americans believe there is a link between vaccines and autism, and 3% aren't sure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supposed link between autism and vaccination is based on two flawed studies that have been &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/autism-vaccine-link-debunked" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;thoroughly and overwhelmingly debunked&lt;/a&gt;. To put it simply, if you listen to the science, there's no there there. Vaccines for measles are safe and effective, and they prevent the disease and thus save lives. If enough people get vaccinated, we can eliminate measles from our country (in fact, the World Health Organization did declare it eradicated in the U.S. back in 2000, though as lower vaccination rates have recently resulted in more frequent outbreaks, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreaks-americas-risk-losing-elimination-status/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;that designation is at risk&lt;/a&gt;). It's really as simple as that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="myth-measles-can-be-cured-or-prevented-with-vitamin-a"&gt;Myth: Measles can be cured or prevented with vitamin A&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that vitamin A can be used to treat measles has a grain of truth of it, but it's a small grain. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7076287/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Studies conducted in developing nations&lt;/a&gt; indicate vitamin A can help prevent complications in severe measles cases, and that children with low amounts of vitamin A tend to develop more severe cases of measles. But in the United States, where few children have such nutritional deficiencies, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/vitamin-a-measles-virus-texas-cdc-what-know-rcna194288" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;it's unclear whether there's any benefit to giving vitamin A for measles&lt;/a&gt;. Some doctors' position is "why not?" but vitamin A is not part of the measles treatment protocol in the U.S., let alone a recognized cure or preventative measure. It's definitely not a substitute for vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent measles cases in the current outbreak, public health officials are encouraging people to get vaccinated. One cool thing about the measles vaccine: As the Texas health department &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-march-4-2025" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, a dose can still be given within 72 hours &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you are exposed to the virus to lessen the severity of the disease if you do get sick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="myth-measles-can-be-prevented-by-natural-means"&gt;Myth: Measles can be prevented by "natural means"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only "natural" way you can prevent the spread of measles is by staying away from other people if you are infected with it. Measles doesn't care if you eat healthy food and work out. It's &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; contagious—according to the CDC, "&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;if one person has it, up to 9 out of 10 people who are nearby will become infected if they are not protected&lt;/a&gt;." Being a generally healthy may result in a better outcome if you &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;infected, but not getting infected in the first place (by being vaccinated) is an infinitely healthier choice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="myth-measles-parties-can-help-kids-gain-natural-immunity"&gt;Myth: Measles parties can help kids gain "natural immunity"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While surviving measles will protect you from reinfection, this "natural" immunity offers no more protection from the disease than vaccination, and, again, it's much riskier: About three out of every 1,000 people who get measles die (&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-first-death-measles-outbreak" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;a tally that sadly included a child in Texas amid the current outbreak&lt;/a&gt;) and more suffer life-changing complications. As Dr. Ron Cook, chief health officer for the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock, put it in a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/measles-parties-texas-outbreak/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt;, "We can’t predict who is going to do poorly with measles, being hospitalized, potentially get pneumonia or encephalitis, or potentially pass away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It’s a foolish thing to go have measles parties," he added, I imagine with a pained sigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="myth-the-current-measles-outbreak-is-normal"&gt;Myth: The current measles outbreak is normal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deadly measles outbreaks &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; unusual in the U.S. Until this year, we hadn't had a child die from measles &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-west-texas-death-rfk-41adc66641e4a56ce2b2677480031ab9" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;since 2015&lt;/a&gt;. Heck, measles has been considered &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;eliminated from both North and South America since 2000&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2000, our measles outbreaks have been small and sporadic, started by travelers who brought a case in from overseas. Quick action from the CDC and from local health authorities has usually managed to get things back under control. But low rates of measles vaccination make it easier for these small outbreaks to spread to larger areas, and we may be looking at a new and growing problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with Texas, this year measles cases have been reported in &lt;a href="https://uknow.uky.edu/uk-healthcare/measles-found-kentucky-how-protect-your-children-and-yourself" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Kentucky,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://abc30.com/post/measles-outbreak-sweeps-states-including-california/15977977/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, New Mexico, Georgia, Alaska, New Jersey, and &lt;a href="https://6abc.com/post/measles-confirmed-unvaccinated-montgomery-county-child-members-public-may-have-been-exposed/15969940/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, but there are less than 200 cases total, so it's unclear if the current wave is the beginning of a larger problem. But it isn't good. The fear is that the current climate of vaccine hesitancy and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html?ldkjfdl" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;reduced vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; will lower the percentage of immunized people enough that measles will reestablish a foothold in the U.S. According to the CDC a vaccination rate of 95% is needed for "herd immunity" but we're slipping below that magic number. Fourteen states have &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health/402025/texas-measles-outbreak-cases-mmr-vaccination" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;fallen under 90 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="myth-you-cant-get-measles-if-youve-been-vaccinated"&gt;Myth: You can't get measles if you've been vaccinated&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine for measles is extremely effective (and safe) but it's not 100% effective. It's &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;"only" 97% effective&lt;/a&gt;. No one knows why a small number of people get measles even though they've had shots. On the bright side, vaccinated people who suffer from "breakout" measles tend to have milder cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="myth-theres-nothing-we-can-do-about-rising-rates-of-measles"&gt;Myth: There's nothing we can do about rising rates of measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sudden spike in measles cases is alarming, but it's nothing compared to a measles outbreak that occurred in the early 1990s. That one was &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; worse, but it also provides historical evidence of how to combat a measles outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the vaccine was nearly 30 years old at that point, there were 27,000 cases of measles in the U.S. in 1990. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/Mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001980.htm" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Low-income communities in New York City&lt;/a&gt; were hit hardest, although outbreaks were also reported in Philadelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Houston. The root cause was the same as with the current rash of the disease: Not enough people were being vaccinated. In 1990, the CDC estimated that about half of all inner-city toddlers in New York City had not been vaccinated by their second birthday, mostly because the vaccine was difficult to get or difficult to afford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The response from city, state, and federal government included wide-ranging public outreach programs, mobile immunization centers, the creation of the federal, congressionally approved Vaccines for Children Program, pro vaccine messages flashed in Times Square, and even &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/05/13/722944146/how-public-health-outreach-ended-a-1990s-measles-outbreak-and-whats-different-no" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Michelangelo from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&lt;/a&gt; emerging from a sewer to encourage kids to get vaccinated. In short, we really threw everything we had at pro-vaccine, anti-measles messaging. And it worked: Vaccination rates &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/066.pdf" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;climbed above 90% in New York&lt;/a&gt;. Whether a similar effort would work in today's climate of distrust and misinformation is an open question, but at least there's evidence vaccination &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; worked to contain an outbreak once before.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers argue that noise provides valuable insights into cognitive processes, from decision-making to moral reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By applying computational models, they show how different types of noise can reflect distinct cognitive mechanisms, rather than random mistakes. This perspective could reshape psychological research and improve interventions in fields like medicine, decision science, and ethics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noise as Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Variability in human behavior may reveal underlying cognitive processes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision-Making Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Some noise enhances decision-making by helping the brain navigate uncertainty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applications in Psychology:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding noise could refine cognitive models and improve real-world decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;APS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The inevitability of variation in human behavior is a phenomenon psychologists have long recognized and developed statistical methods to account for in their analyses. Human behavior varies not only between people, but within separate instances for one individual as well.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study of that individual variability, called “noise” by many psychologists, is the topic of focus in a special issue of &lt;em&gt;Perspectives on Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;, published in March 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108046"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Is that noise an error in our cognitive processes or does it actually help us perform better? Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joakim Sundh and his coauthors from Uppsala University set the stage for this discussion by first providing an historical review of how noise has previously been studied in psychological research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They argue that noise is typically studied as an external factor that needs to be minimized rather than an internal factor that can provide information about the process being studied.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All noise has a source, and different sources of noise can give rise to different expressions of noise,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If these different sources of noise are associated with distinct processes, then one can use the way noise is expressed in data to draw conclusions regarding those processes.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sundh and his team also describe their own research with their Precise/Not Precise (PNP) model, which was developed to help determine how different sources of noise are associated with different psychological processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They apply the PNP model to three experiments, illustrating how distributions of noise can be studied to determine analytic and intuitive ways of reasoning (&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17456916241235889" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sundh et al., 2025&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors end by previewing the three additional contributions to the special issue, concluding that each of the papers “represent excellent example of the possibilities inherent in using noise to inform scientific inquiry by treating it as a source of information.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adam Sanborn and his team from the University of Warwick expand on this discussion by exploring the purpose of noise in the human thought process.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Asking participants to perform the same task on multiple occasions, even when those occasions are close together in time, produces surprisingly noisy behavior,” the authors wrote.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is that noise an error in our cognitive processes or does it actually help us perform better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, Sanborn and his coauthors discuss the role of noise throughout the stages of information processing, from perception to computation to response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They argue that it is more accurate to view noise as a feature of cognitive processing rather than a glitch that disrupts it (&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17456916241258951" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sanborn et al., 2025&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not only could one say that ‘noise’ in cognition is a feature and not a bug, but even that it is an essential feature, which underpins our ability to deal with an uncertain world of such complexity that precise analysis is computationally impossible,” Sanborn and his coauthors wrote.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though noisy behavior is widely acknowledged as inevitable, in many cases it is preferable for individuals to be consistent in how they categorize information. For example, a doctor assessing for the presence of skin cancer is expected to make a consistent and correct diagnosis every time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study, Florian Seitz (University of Basel) and his coauthors work to better understand the ways noise can be reduced as individuals categorize information.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, they present a simulation that accounts for possible sources of behavioral variability during the process of perceiving and processing information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their simulation Seitz and colleagues used two common category structures: (1) rule-based structures where a category is based on a single feature, and (2) information-integration structures where a category is determined by multiple features that are considered simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers argue that by integrating continuous data into experiments that assess categorization, researchers may be better able to identify the sources of behavioral noise and categorize the cognitive processes at play (&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17456916241264259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Seitz et al., 2025&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Assessing people’s category beliefs in a continuous way may therefore help disentangle perceptual and process-related sources of behavioral variability,” Seitz and his team wrote, adding that this finding could inform both future cognitive models and applied interventions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by recent chaotic responses to current events like the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing campaigns of misinformation, APS Fellow Michel Regenwetter and his team from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign explore the presence of irrational moral judgement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They use the concept of transitivity as a foundation for their discussion. This philosophical concept is used in discussions of morality as a kind of logic equation— the understanding that if A is better than B, and B is better than C, then A is better than C. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regenwetter and his coauthors investigate whether participants can be described by the principle of transitivity, despite the large amount of variation in their behavior. Their study included 28 participants from the Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant was presented with a survey of 126 moral vignettes, each of which was accompanied by a binary-choice question. For each vignette, they were instructed to choose the option that was “worse” or the most “morally wrong.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on their sample, the team found that participants did adhere to transitive moral thinking, suggesting that a shared set of moral principles underlies how people judge the moral value of one item over another (&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17456916241260611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Regenwetter et al., 2025&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite the amazing heterogeneity of behavior in the world around us, there may be order underneath the chaos,” they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychology and behavioral neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bfd7ddcdd0c8d1ffcfccc6dcd7d0d3d0d8d6dcded3ccdcd6dad1dcda91d0cdd8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Hannah Brown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://psychologicalscience.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;APS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Hannah Brown – APS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 14:20:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE5IZlFsRGF5RGNyeGNuM3Z2czJjZmlOOHcyMjZ5RmxYTzdDSUlmMURKQmxvY1ZRZHE5VVRYUE9yNHNwTG9VYXFfWE9aZkVZQnBMbFFZR2phLXcwOTdBaXRLRENObllTR0RvUGQ0Mjljc2lLZw</guid></item><item><title>Iron dysregulation linked to long COVID development - News-Medical.Net</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxQMFpsT2FtOFZrWFZoZWNWS3ZZbGdnYzR0U2ViVDdNX2Q2V0JIV1NQVHVXWGNyVGJqS1B0dFVpMW1KX2dRZXQ1NTJBOExiamVhbnVEN29ZbE9MYXhpRm9Ud3BVSXpaMDJacmIyeVNOODhHVEI1MlVSTmRZRWJXcG5UVlFhMDc2V0F2Sk83d1JoV0R5d281ZlpHVFUwLUxMcHdo?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="body-0e5bea20-25bb-4528-a267-a6f1ddcb45a1" class="page-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems with iron levels in the blood and the body's ability to regulate this important nutrient as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be a key trigger for long COVID, new research has discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery not only points to possible ways to prevent or treat the condition, but could help explain why symptoms similar to those of long COVID are also commonly seen in a number of post-viral conditions and chronic &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-Does-Inflammation-Do-to-the-Body.aspx" class="linked-term"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although estimates are highly variable, as many as three in 10 people infected with SARS-CoV-2 could go on to develop long COVID, with symptoms including fatigue, shortness of breath, muscle aches and problems with memory and concentration ('brain fog'). An estimated 1.9 million people in the UK alone were experiencing self-reported long COVID as of March 2023, according to the Office of National Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers at the University of Cambridge began recruiting people who had tested positive for the virus to the COVID-19 cohort of the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) BioResource. These included asymptomatic healthcare staff identified via routine screening through to patients admitted to Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, some to its intensive care unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a year, participants provided blood samples, allowing researchers to monitor changes in the blood post-infection. As it became clear that a significant number of patients would go on to have symptoms that persisted - long COVID - researchers were able to track back through these samples to see whether any changes in the blood correlated with their later condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In findings published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Immunology&lt;/em&gt;, researchers at the Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Disease (CITIID), University of Cambridge, together with colleagues at Oxford, analyzed blood samples from 214 individuals. Approximately 45% of those questioned about their recovery reported symptoms of long COVID between three and ten months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Ken Smith, who was Director of CITIID at the time of the study and will take up a position as Director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (WEHI) in Melbourne, Australia, in April, said: "Having recruited a group of people with SARS-CoV-2 early in the pandemic, analysis of several blood samples and clinical information collected over a 12 month period after infection has proved invaluable in giving us important and unexpected insights into why, for some unlucky individuals, initial SARS-CoV-2 infection is followed by months of persistent symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mobile-middle-mrec-promo-spot" class="mobile-promo-wrap mobile-promo-mrec"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team discovered that ongoing inflammation - a natural part of the immune response to infection - and low iron levels in blood, contributing to anemia and disrupting healthy red blood cell production, could be seen as early as two weeks post COVID-19 in those individuals reporting long COVID many months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early iron dysregulation was detectable in the long COVID group independent of age, sex, or initial COVID-19 severity, suggesting a possible impact on recovery even in those who were at low risk for severe COVID-19, or who did not require hospitalization or oxygen therapy when sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="trendmd-conditional-suggestions" class="related-content-embed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Aimee Hanson, who worked on the study while at the University of Cambridge, and is now at the University of Bristol, said: "Iron levels, and the way the body regulates iron, were disrupted early on during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and took a very long time to recover, particularly in those people who went on to report long COVID months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Although we saw evidence that the body was trying to rectify low iron availability and the resulting anemia by producing more red blood cells, it was not doing a particularly good job of it in the face of ongoing inflammation."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, although iron dysregulation was more profound during and following severe COVID-19, those who went on to develop long COVID after a milder course of acute COVID-19 showed similar patterns in the blood. The most pronounced association with long COVID was how quickly inflammation, iron levels and regulation returned to normal following SARS-CoV-2 infection - though symptoms tended to continue long after iron levels had recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-author Professor Hal Drakesmith, from the MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine at the University of Oxford, said iron dysregulation is a common consequence of inflammation and is a natural response to infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When the body has an infection, it responds by removing iron from the bloodstream. This protects us from potentially lethal bacteria that capture the iron in the bloodstream and grow rapidly. It's an evolutionary response that redistributes iron in the body, and the blood plasma becomes an iron desert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"However, if this goes on for a long time, there is less iron for red blood cells, so oxygen is transported less efficiently affecting metabolism and energy production, and for white blood cells, which need iron to work properly. The protective mechanism ends up becoming a problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mobile-bottom-mrec-promo-spot" class="mobile-promo-wrap mobile-promo-mrec"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The findings may help explain why symptoms such as fatigue and exercise intolerance are common in long COVID, as well as in several other post-viral syndromes with lasting symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers say the study points to potential ways of preventing or reducing the impact of long COVID by rectifying iron dysregulation in early COVID-19 to prevent adverse long-term health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach might be controlling the extreme inflammation as early as possible, before it impacts on iron regulation. Another approach might involve iron supplementation; however as Dr. Hanson pointed out, this may not be straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn't necessarily the case that individuals don't have enough iron in their body, it's just that it's trapped in the wrong place. What we need is a way to remobilize the iron and pull it back into the bloodstream, where it becomes more useful to the red blood cells."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Aimee Hanson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research also supports 'accidental' findings from other studies, including the IRONMAN study, which was looking at whether iron supplements benefited patients with heart failure - the study was disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but preliminary findings suggest that trial participants were less likely to develop severe adverse effects from COVID-19. Similar effects have been observed among people living with the blood disorder beta-thalassemia, which can cause individuals to produce too much iron in their blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by Wellcome, the Medical Research Council, NIHR and European Union Horizon 2020 Programme.&lt;/p&gt;

They can hide in unsuspecting corners of the environment and interact with living organisms in ways that raise many questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One particular fungus, &lt;em&gt;Beauveria bassiana&lt;/em&gt;, has captured attention because of its interactions with insects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its spores settle on an insect and then germinate and penetrate through the cuticle. The insect dies within days and forms the substrate for a white fungal mold that grows and flourishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/biosciences/hidalgo-alicia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prof. Alicia Hidalgo&lt;/a&gt;, from the University of Birmingham, directed a recent investigation into infections in insects by this devastating fungus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-immune-responses-to-brain-fungus"&gt;Immune responses to brain fungus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fruit flies became the chosen subjects for this study because their immune system shares some features with that of more complex creatures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers often turn to these small insects when exploring disease processes in a simple model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed the effect of the fungus on the brains of flies and found that flies infected with &lt;em&gt;B. bassiana&lt;/em&gt; suffered a reduction in the number of brain cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They identified that the fly’s own immune system was “tricked” by the invading fungus to start destroying brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In flies, Toll receptors are agents of the immune system. When infected with the fungus, the Toll-1 receptors in the flies triggered the release of antimicrobial peptides that attack and kill pathogens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the fungus also provoked the Toll-1 receptors to produce another molecule, called Sarm, that suppresses the immune response and destroys brain cells instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have shown a process for how &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plants-and-fungi-communicate-using-a-silent-language/"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt; have evolved to trick the immune system to get into the brain,” said Prof. Hidalgo. Her findings suggest that a normal line of defense can accidentally turn against the very organ it’s meant to protect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sarm-s-link-to-neurodegeneration"&gt;Sarm’s link to neurodegeneration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the immune system tries to confront this fungus, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2738257/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sarm&lt;/a&gt; molecules step up their activity; they have the potential to sabotage defenses by encouraging cell damage in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key antagonist in the immune process is Sarm&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;a so-called master of destruction, that is causing cell death in the brain. The ability of &lt;em&gt;B. bassiana &lt;/em&gt;to trick the fruit fly immune system into activating the master of destruction Sarm and kill&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;cells enables spores to beat the blood-brain barrier and start feeding on brain cells,” commented Hidalgo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process, known as neurodegeneration, describes the gradual breakdown of nerve cells. If immune signals become confused, the result might be nerve destruction in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts note that this fungus, though hazardous to insects, is widely used for insect management in agriculture. It is developed into a type of pesticide and used to kills certain insects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings offer a curious look at how a single microbe might manipulate host biology for its own benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-this-fungus-mean-for-humans"&gt;What does this fungus mean for humans?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is important to stress that &lt;em&gt;B. bassiana&lt;/em&gt; cannot affect humans,” explained &lt;a href="https://web-cdn.bsky.app/profile/did:plc:d6rwoejbzaavw4wcxlydd6un" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Deepanshu Singh&lt;/a&gt;, now a post-doc at the University of Manchester. The fungus targets insects, but it stays clear of mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fungi-can-think-and-make-smart-decisions-without-a-brain/"&gt;other fungi&lt;/a&gt; are known to reach the human brain under certain conditions. These discoveries hint that parallel strategies might pop up in different species, especially when fungal organisms are trying to survive inside a host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-broader-perspective-on-fungal-threats"&gt;A broader perspective on fungal threats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some scientists believe that future work could explore whether similar immune system misdirection happens in other animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how these pathogens find loopholes in the immune system may help researchers develop new interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fungal infections often get less attention than bacterial or viral illnesses, yet they can still pose serious threats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The possibility that a fungus might slip into the human central nervous system and confuse its defenses encourages further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implications-for-neurodegenerative-diseases"&gt;Implications for neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery that a fungal infection can manipulate immune responses to attack brain cells raises questions about similar mechanisms in humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, involve &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-tiny-bacteria-outsmart-the-human-immune-system/"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; dysfunction and excessive inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If certain pathogens can trigger destructive immune pathways, this could offer new insights into how inflammation contributes to neurodegeneration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers may investigate whether similar immune evasion tactics occur in human infections, potentially linking fungal exposure to long-term neurological effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-possible-next-steps-in-fungal-research"&gt;Possible next steps in fungal research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists hope to identify molecules that can protect nerve cells when the immune system is tricked. Pinpointing the exact signals could spark novel medical approaches for people at risk of certain &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/orchid-parents-nurture-seedlings-through-fungal-networks/"&gt;fungal&lt;/a&gt; infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research also continues on ways to control fungal spread in agricultural settings without harming beneficial insects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;B. bassiana&lt;/em&gt; remains a useful tool for pest management, though its tactics highlight the complexity of the microbe-host relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 14:10:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxNVnRTbGNYSHZuSjlySzRSaVpwNTh3RjBCdGZlcld2OUVJY0dHSl9WOXA3MnB5OVE2ZXl3V2NxcVNXWkp1VHlPRE1PbUNleUY5WEZFeHpHazNab01VMmt3OUs1TXhKZEx6eUpZOFRsanVNQmltY2loelJoU19mY0NMeDNMT0djQTVYRjBjUmd1THEzd0VJUWZDY2xzRHNzaVRvQVVDSzlVQnB5YlM5c0E</guid></item><item><title>Anxiety and Apathy Affect Decision-Making in Opposite Ways - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE1kNzJSWDMxcTVDZTdqV1M1RG5aQ1BmOVRyWEJOVEUwaHNhWHNiUkg5c0VfSm9oZGJGV0F5cDg5eG9Yc0FhejBQb3pEeUJhOXFXQ1NMM09CWGN4aDhieGpVcXRRSktEeTdEcDRIRENB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals that anxiety and apathy lead to fundamentally different patterns in decision-making under uncertainty. Anxious individuals perceive their environment as highly volatile, leading them to explore more options, especially after negative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, apathetic individuals view outcomes as random, reducing their willingness to explore new choices. These findings highlight the need for tailored therapeutic approaches that account for how patients perceive and process uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anxiety and Decision-Making:&lt;/strong&gt; Anxious individuals perceive more volatility and explore more after failures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apathy and Exploration:&lt;/strong&gt; Apathetic individuals see outcomes as random and reduce exploratory behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings suggest therapies should be tailored to patients’ uncertainty perceptions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Minnesota&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making decisions in uncertain situations is part of daily life. New research from the University of Minnesota Medical School has uncovered that anxiety and apathy — two common but distinct emotional states — lead to fundamentally different patterns in how people learn and make decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were recently published in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study investigated how anxiety and apathy — or a lack of interest and enthusiasm — affects people’s perception of uncertainty and their subsequent decision-making behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a combination of behavioral experiments and computational modeling, researchers examined how more than 1,000 participants made choices in a dynamic environment where they had to repeatedly decide between exploring new options or sticking with familiar ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While anxiety and apathy often occur simultaneously in clinical conditions, our findings show they actually lead to opposite patterns in how people process uncertainty and make decisions,” said Alexander Herman, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the U of M Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This helps explain why these conditions might require different therapeutic approaches.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key findings include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anxious individuals perceive higher environmental volatility and explore more options, especially after negative outcomes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apathetic individuals view outcomes as more random and show reduced exploratory behavior&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ratio of perceived volatility to randomness mediates the relationship between anxiety and exploratory behavior&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These emotional states affect both openness to new experiences and perceptions of unpredictability of the world,” said Xinyuan Yan, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at the U of M Medical School and the study’s lead author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, an anxious person might view the job market as unpredictable and requiring constant vigilance — obsessively checking job boards despite rejections. Someone experiencing apathy might see job searching as random, using the same resume — believing changes won’t matter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research provides a new framework for understanding how emotional states influence decision-making, with important implications for treating neuropsychiatric conditions. The findings suggest that therapeutic approaches might be more effective if tailored to how patients perceive and process uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was funded by the National Institutes of Mental Health [R21MH127607], National Institute on Drug Abuse [K23DA050909] and the University of Minnesota’s MnDRIVE initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health and decision making research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#01602c726c68756941746c6f2f646574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alexandra Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://umn.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Alexandra Smith – University of Minnesota&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2025.01.005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Distinct computational mechanisms of uncertainty processing explain opposing exploratory behaviors in anxiety and apathy&lt;/a&gt;” by Alexander Herman et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct computational mechanisms of uncertainty processing explain opposing exploratory behaviors in anxiety and apathy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0015"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decision-making in uncertain environments can lead to varied outcomes, and how we process those outcomes may depend on our emotional state. Understanding how individuals interpret the sources of uncertainty is crucial for understanding adaptive behavior and mental well-being. Uncertainty can be broadly categorized into two components: volatility and stochasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volatility describes how quickly conditions change. Stochasticity, on the other hand, refers to outcome randomness. We investigated how anxiety and apathy influenced people’s perceptions of uncertainty, and how uncertainty perception shaped explore-exploit decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0020"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants (N = 1001, non-clinical sample) completed a restless three-armed bandit task that was analyzed using both latent state and process models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxious individuals perceived uncertainty as resulting more from volatility, leading to &lt;em&gt;increased&lt;/em&gt; exploration and learning rates, especially after reward omission. Conversely, apathetic individuals viewed uncertainty as more stochastic, resulting in &lt;em&gt;decreased&lt;/em&gt; exploration and learning rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perceived volatility-to-stochasticity ratio mediated the anxiety-exploration relationship post-adverse outcomes. Dimensionality reduction showed exploration and uncertainty estimation to be distinct but related latent factors shaping a manifold of adaptive behavior that is modulated by anxiety and apathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0030"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings reveal distinct computational mechanisms for how anxiety and apathy influence decision-making, providing a framework for understanding cognitive and affective processes in neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

Dr Eric Berg, DC, issued the warning on his YouTube channel, which has more than 13 million subscribers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Berg, aged 57, is a chiropractor specialising in healthy ketosis and intermittent fasting. He is the author of the best-selling book The Healthy Keto Plan, and is the Director of Dr Berg Nutritionals. He no longer practices, but focuses on health education through social media.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In his video, he discussed the "top vitamin deficiency that mimics dementia" - vitamin B12. Having enough of the vitamin in your body is important as it helps your body produce red blood cells, which carry oxygen to your tissues and organs, create and regulate DNA, and converts food into energy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It also helps your central nervous system develop and function properly, and supports healthy cognitive functioning and memory. If you don't get enough vitamin B12, you may experience weakness, numbness, trouble walking, nausea, weight loss, irritability, fatigue, and increased heart rate. Your bones, hair, skin, and nails may be affected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Berg says: "&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article-abstract/56/11/M675/591139?redirectedFrom=fulltext" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Vitamin B12 is essential for normal brain function&lt;/a&gt;—without it, you can experience symptoms of dementia. This vitamin is found most abundantly in animal products, though certain microbes can also produce it. Low animal product consumption is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Research shows a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/56/11/M675/591139#:~:text=Thus%2C%20the%20dietary%20deficiency%20of,deficiency%20also%20causes%20peripheral%20neuropathy." rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to issues with nerve function, which may result in conditions like dementia&lt;/a&gt;, peripheral neuropathy, or subacute combined degeneration. A lack of vitamin B12 can interfere with DNA synthesis and lead to an accumulation of homocysteine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A study from 2020 found a "clear association between low vitamin B12 levels and progressive cognitive impairment". Researchers pointed out however that "further studies are needed to confirm and refine the observed associations over a larger scale and to determine whether this change will translate to a reduction in cognitive decline".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Low vitamin B12 levels are often found in more than &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8078229/#:~:text=Background,cognitive%20function%20in%20later%20life." rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;10% of older people&lt;/a&gt;. Besides memory loss, a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22221769/#:~:text=Results:%20Vitamin%20B12%20levels%20in,B12%20insufficiency%20and%20neurodegenerative%20disease." rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin B12 deficiency can also cause other neurological problems and psychological symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, such as:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Confusion&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Difficulty thinking and reasoning&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Tingling and numbness in the hands or feet&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Loss of balance and coordination&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Weakness&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Vision problems&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Peripheral neuropathy, which damages the nervous system&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Depression, anxiety, paranoia, and delusions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Incontinence&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Loss of taste and smell&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;If diagnosed, treatment for a vitamin B12 deficiency usually involves taking high doses of vitamin B12, either through injections or a B12 supplement. Your doctor may require regular blood tests to monitor vitamin B12 levels&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The longer the condition goes untreated, the higher the chance of permanent damage. However, vitamin B12 deficiency can be reversed, and most individuals experience significant recovery within three to six months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; says: "As most cases of vitamin B12 deficiency or folate deficiency can be easily and effectively treated, complications are rare. But complications can occasionally develop, particularly if you have been deficient in either vitamin for some time."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31134394" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="author"&gt; (Image: Getty)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other symptoms of a vitamin B12 deficiency can include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Numbness, pins and needles, and tingling in the extremities&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Pale skin&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Poor balance or staggering&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Rapid pulse&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Swelling of the tongue&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another cause of vitamin B12 deficiency is low hydrochloric acid (HCL) in your stomach, he added. Explaining why, he said: "Your digestive system requires HCL to break down and absorb many vitamins and minerals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"As you age, your HCL level decreases. It can also decrease if you take antacids or Metformin. Interestingly, acid reflux can be a sign of low HCL, and taking antacids can make matters worse. Betaine hydrochloride is the best way to promote normal stomach acidity."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The health expert also says you may experience dementia-like symptoms due to the side effects of certain medications and substances, including:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Antacids&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Bladder medications&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Sleep aids&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;SSRIs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cholesterol medications&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Blood pressure medications&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Steroids&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Alcohol&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;A deficiency in these any of the following nutrients may also produce dementia-like symptoms, such as vitamin B1, which is often caused by high sugar and carb consumption, Dr Berg adds. As well as zinc - often a result of phytic acid in grains - and &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000000755" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; - caused by low sun exposure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31134341" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;span class="caption" itemprop="description"&gt;Vegetarianism and metformin use can contribute to low vitamin B12 levels.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Nutrient deficiencies may shrink your hippocampus, which leads to Alzheimer’s disease," Dr Berg said. A study titled '&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11247665/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Concurrent nutrient deficiencies are associated with dementia incidence&lt;/a&gt;' states: "Concurrent nutrient deficiencies are associated with the risk of dementia."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, it adds: "The potential of optimising nutritional status to lower dementia risk warrants further study." Meanwhile, a UCL analysis also shows that the "&lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2023/nov/analysis-hippocampus-size-linked-cognitive-decline-even-those-no-signs-alzheimers#:~:text=But%20in%20conditions%20such%20as,hippocampus%20correlated%20with%20cognitive%20decline." rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;hippocampus size linked with cognitive decline even in those with no signs of Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Berg continued: "Increasing your ketones will help nourish a brain starved of fuel and nutrients". If you’re experiencing dementia symptoms, Dr Berg recommends speaking to your doctor about potentially starting a keto diet, consuming more fatty fish, red meat and seafood, and taking betaine hydrochloride.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Early common symptoms of dementia:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Forgetting recent events, names, and faces&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Difficulty concentrating&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Difficulty planning or organizing&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Difficulty with language and communication&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Misunderstanding what is being seen&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Being confused about time or place&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Mood changes or difficulty controlling emotions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other symptoms:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Difficulty completing familiar tasks&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Becoming more withdrawn or anxious&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Misplacing common items, such as glasses or keys&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Difficulty learning new things&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Reduced motivation&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Hallucinations and delusions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Depression or anxiety&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;As dementia advances, individuals may exhibit aggressive behaviour, have difficulty recognising their condition, experience sleep disturbances, and face misperceptions or misidentifications, along with a shifting sense of time. Each person's experience with dementia is unique, and various forms of dementia can impact individuals in distinct ways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The initial signs of dementia can often be quite subtle and unclear. If you have any concerns or display any of the symptoms mentioned, speak to a doctor. If you do not have a vitamin deficiency, your doctor will explore other causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 13:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxOZS1mdjQ1NnNSLUZSYWtlRlJKZkVuTDgxRld6UXV4Z2llXzZfRWJOZWIwTERXWFNMUkJjQXg2c1M5TkYtWEVoLVUxZ0tiam5YWF9Qam1iZUswbGMtTnd4S0dtWWFVSTZuOHVkSHJYc29oaGlyX1phUU5TVF83QjZmVy0wRlJzNG8yMnVEUXhfbmY</guid></item><item><title>Will warning labels on ultra-processed foods make America healthy again? - Vox.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxPNVduYjRXUEdPd0szdTctZ1JpM3FjVm1GWjlCRU1jZXFNZ0JGZzVZcGp0c3pDamF5S1k1alR0U0dsZ1dvMzJpNVhVano3NUllZi1vNjhhSDBPUkk1RHpDWVQyTEpwYk5jcG5sWFZhenJaRVV6SUpwYVUzMDZoY1NQRGVLXzZJZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="zephr-anchor" class="_1agbrixz"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;After decades of lobbying, the US government has finally started taking action to warn consumers about the hazards of ultra-processed foods: your potato chips, granola bars, cereal, frozen pizza, even many types of store-bought bread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As I &lt;a href="/future-perfect/370257/ultra-processed-food-obesity-disease-depression-anxiety"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last year, there is mounting scientific evidence linking such ultra-processed foods, or UPFs, to disorders that range from obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure to depression, anxiety, and autoimmune disorders. Precisely what is classified as a UPF isn’t perfect and the category can sometimes be too broad, as my colleague Marina Bolotnikova &lt;a href="/future-perfect/391795/ultra-processed-foods-science-vegan-meat-rfk-maha"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; in December, but there’s still a growing consumer &lt;a href="https://www.futureoffood.institute/portfolio-en/articles/ultra-processed-foods/"&gt;desire&lt;/a&gt; for clarity about what we’re buying and eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst3"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst6"&gt;Sign up &lt;a href="/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

New &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/politics/rfk-jr-senate-confirmation-vote/index.html"&gt;Secretary&lt;/a&gt; of Health and Human Services Robert Kennedy Jr., will likely continue this work; he has &lt;a href="https://www.minnpost.com/race-health-equity/2025/02/a-closer-look-at-rfk-jr-s-stance-on-ultra-processed-foods/"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; UPFs “&lt;a href="https://time.com/7211678/rfk-jr-ultra-processed-foods-ban/"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;,” and has promised reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A handful of &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/docserver/fulltext/nutr/41/1/annurev-nutr-111120-094932.pdf?expires=1740681859&amp;amp;id=id&amp;amp;accname=guest&amp;amp;checksum=DD96AFA25E153778F94A1B04EE8C96F4"&gt;countries&lt;/a&gt; in Latin America and Europe have already introduced similar front-of-package nutrition labels. In 2020, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9067899/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20Mexico%20adopted%20new,with%20the%20statement%20%E2%80%9Cavoid%2Fnot"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; passed a law that required a variety of warning labels on all packaged foods and beverages; the labels include black stop-sign shaped figures that indicate if the product has excessive sugar, sodium, or saturated fats. Chile was the first country to pass such a law back in &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23288604.2020.1753159"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;. The UK has a similar &lt;a href="https://thecritic.co.uk/ultra-processed-arguments/"&gt;system&lt;/a&gt; in place, but companies are not legally required to add the warnings to their products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The US may be late to the nutrition-warning game, but the good news is that similar efforts in other places have been effective in raising consumer awareness of UPF’s nutritional hazards and in pressuring manufacturers to make healthier products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These labels enable consumers to make more informed decisions about what they eat without infringing on their rights to eat what they want. But while nutrition experts have welcomed the FDA’s proposed policy change, the addition of warning labels to packaged goods hasn’t been shown to reduce the very real burden of chronic diseases. For that, we’ll need systemic change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="are-warning-labels-effective" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are warning labels effective?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Much of the real-world evidence describing the impact of front-of-package nutrition labels comes from Latin American countries. They have long been pioneers in UPF &lt;a href="https://www.truehealthinitiative.org/council_member/carlos-a-monteiro/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; and regulation, in part because of their high burden of chronic diseases linked to UPF consumption but also because of how the spread of UPFs &lt;a href="https://novaramedia.com/2024/10/14/latin-america-is-leading-the-charge-against-ultra-processed-food/"&gt;pushed out traditional foods&lt;/a&gt;, explained &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vanessa-Couto-3"&gt;Vanessa Couto&lt;/a&gt;, a public health nutrition researcher at the University of São Paulo in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In some 30 Latin American &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lanam/PIIS2667-193X%2822%2900217-4.pdf"&gt;countries&lt;/a&gt; that have added front-of-package nutrition warnings, public health researchers have found that well-designed labels can help consumers be more informed about what’s in the products they buy. “We see people shifting toward healthier options, avoiding less healthy options,” explained &lt;a href="https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/marissa-g-hall-phd/"&gt;Marissa Hall&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health. “We also see where labeling can help people understand what’s in their food and which products are high in nutrients of concern.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One 2024 &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004463"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of almost 3,000 households in Chile found that consumers purchased significantly fewer products labeled as high in sugar, calories, sodium, and fat, amounting to an estimated 36.8 percent reduction in sugar consumption, a 23 percent reduced calorie intake, a 21.9 percent reduction in sodium, and a 15.7 percent drop in saturated fat consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But not all studies report these impacts. Another &lt;a href="https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-024-01664-w"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in Brazil, found that while a “Warning: ultra-processed food” label significantly improved the ability of consumers to identify what products were UPF, it did not influence their purchasing intentions or perceptions of healthfulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The other benefit of nutrition labels on packaged foods is that it creates a market pressure for UPF manufacturers to make healthier foods, Hall explained. After Chile implemented its warning label law, the proportion of UPF products that were high in sugar dropped from &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/docserver/fulltext/nutr/41/1/annurev-nutr-111120-094932.pdf?expires=1741101065&amp;amp;id=id&amp;amp;accname=guest&amp;amp;checksum=99D3C8EDCFEB752FDB27E78C75F3B9A9"&gt;80 to 60 percent&lt;/a&gt; while products high in sodium dropped from 74 to 27 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Similar schemes in New Zealand and the Netherlands that allowed companies to display a logo indicating a product’s healthfulness if it met certain nutritional requirements also prompted companies to swiftly reformulate products. One study found that there was a &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/docserver/fulltext/nutr/41/1/annurev-nutr-111120-094932.pdf?expires=1741101065&amp;amp;id=id&amp;amp;accname=guest&amp;amp;checksum=99D3C8EDCFEB752FDB27E78C75F3B9A9"&gt;61 percent reduction&lt;/a&gt; of salt in cereal products in New Zealand while 20 percent of products were reformulated in the Netherlands after the labeling schemes were introduced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The FDA’s &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-proposes-requiring-glance-nutrition-information-front-packaged-foods"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; nutritional labels aren’t the same as those used in Latin America. In Chile and Mexico, companies are required to use bold, black stop-sign shaped icons on the front of a package, which communicate whether the product is high in fat, sugar, or sodium. If a package has three stop signs, then it is high in all three. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The FDA’s &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-proposes-requiring-glance-nutrition-information-front-packaged-foods"&gt;version&lt;/a&gt; consists of small, black-and-white boxes similar to existing nutritional facts boxes that already appear on the back of packaged foods, though they’ll be placed on the front. These boxes will indicate if a product contains low, medium, or high levels of saturated fat, sodium, and added sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Food and Drug Administration’s proposed front-of-package nutritional labels. /FDA&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Front-of-packaging warning labels used in Chile indicating that foods are high in calories, sugars, salt and saturated fat/ Chilean Ministry of Health&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So the US labels could show that a product is high in salt but low in sugar and then leave it to the consumer to decide if that is good or bad. Contextualizing percentages can be helpful, but comparing such trade-offs isn’t always intuitive. “I’m concerned that it might be confusing for people to understand an overall product’s healthfulness when they’re making sense of all these different nutrients,” Hall said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Others have been far more critical of the FDA’s proposed nutrition labels. Sen. Bernie Sanders &lt;a href="https://vermontbiz.com/news/2025/january/14/sanders-statement-fdas-weak-proposed-front-package-nutrition-labels"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the labels were “pathetically weak and must be substantially improved.” He suggested that UPF warning labels should more resemble the FDA-mandated warning &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/labeling-and-warning-statements-tobacco-products/cigarette-labeling-and-health-warning-requirements#:~:text=For%20cigarette%20cartons%2C%20the%20required,cellophane%20or%20other%20clear%20wrapping."&gt;labels&lt;/a&gt; on cigarettes that explicitly state smoking causes fatal lung disease, heart disease, cataracts, bladder cancer, and a list of other conditions. (Earlier this year, a federal judge in Texas &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-blocks-fda-graphic-warning-label-requirement-cigarettes-2025-01-14/"&gt;blocked&lt;/a&gt; an FDA mandate to require graphic warnings of smoking’s health risks.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While warning labels improved consumer awareness in studies, this hasn’t translated into overall improved health outcomes. Chile introduced nutrition warning labels in 2012, but obesity rates have continued to rise from about &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1468754/overweight-obesity-prevalence-chile/"&gt;68 percent&lt;/a&gt; in 2010 to 79 percent in 2022. The Chilean government even introduced other measures to reduce UPF consumption; for example, by increasing the tax on sugary beverages from 13 percent to &lt;a href="https://www.bcn.cl/leychile/navegar?idNorma=1067194&amp;amp;idParte=&amp;amp;idVersion=2014-10-01"&gt;18 percent&lt;/a&gt; in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In Mexico, which introduced labeling mandates in 2020, childhood obesity &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9433666/#:~:text=In%20school%2Dage%20children%2C%20the,2021%20(2%E2%80%934)."&gt;rates&lt;/a&gt; dropped slightly from 38.2 percent in 2020 to 37.3 percent the following year, but the number of people with diabetes increased from &lt;a href="https://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;amp;pid=S0036-36342021000600725#:~:text=The%20total%20prevalence%20of%20diabetes,were%20associated%20with%20better%20control."&gt;15.7 percent&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 to 18.2 percent &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(24)00059-0/fulltext"&gt;in 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It may simply be too soon for public health officials to observe improvements in obesity and other chronic disease rates. What’s clear is that we will need more than nutrition labels to create a food environment that allows everyone to eat healthy nutritious foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-more-needs-to-be-done-to-make-america-healthy-again" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What more needs to be done to “make America healthy again&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While studies in Latin American countries have reported that front-of-package warning labels on UPFs are effective at improving awareness among consumers, this is really only one small step in the right direction. To actually reduce UPF consumption and improve health, we would need true systemic change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;More than &lt;a href="https://www.socialpolicylab.org/post/grow-your-blog-community#:~:text=New%20analysis%20from%20the%20Association,Americans%20struggles%20to%20eat%20daily."&gt;20 million&lt;/a&gt; Americans live in food deserts without consistent access to healthy foods. These areas tend to be &lt;a href="https://www.newrootsinstitute.org/articles/food-deserts#:~:text=Low%20Income,than%20its%20lack%20of%20availability."&gt;low-income and rural&lt;/a&gt; communities where there is a shortage of food retailers and a lack of transportation to get there. Unprocessed or minimally processed foods are, on average, more than &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7551888/#:~:text=A%20recent%20study%20from%20the,1.45%2F100%20kcal)."&gt;twice as expensive&lt;/a&gt; as UPFs per calorie, according to one study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;True success would require improving health education in schools, raising the quality of school lunches, and ensuring that everyone can actually afford fresh, healthy foods — a tall order in a country that has long prioritized profits over health and safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It remains unclear what might happen to the FDA’s proposed legislation under the Trump administration. Kennedy seems keen to take on UPFs as part of his Make America Healthy Again crusade — he currently &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-weighing-fda-crackdown-on-food-additives-under-trump/"&gt;wants&lt;/a&gt; the FDA to ban certain additives, dyes, and chemicals currently used in UPF. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What do experts recommend? Aside from mandating warning labels on packaged goods, the FDA needs to also regulate other marketing claims that UPF companies make on their products, Hall argued. For instance, many products claim to be “100 percent all natural,” which Hall’s research has shown makes many consumers incorrectly assume the product has no added sugars. But this can be false because there is no standard or even legal definition of “natural.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Nutritional labels on UPF, along with other policy changes such as banning certain food dyes, is just the beginning. “It takes small steps,” Baker said. And while she and many are hopeful that Kennedy’s “food is medicine” outlook will usher in change, many fear that the Trump administration’s federal staff and budget cuts will hamper efforts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxPNVduYjRXUEdPd0szdTctZ1JpM3FjVm1GWjlCRU1jZXFNZ0JGZzVZcGp0c3pDamF5S1k1alR0U0dsZ1dvMzJpNVhVano3NUllZi1vNjhhSDBPUkk1RHpDWVQyTEpwYk5jcG5sWFZhenJaRVV6SUpwYVUzMDZoY1NQRGVLXzZJZw</guid></item><item><title>The 5 Easiest Ways To Reduce Inflammation In Your Body, According To Doctors - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE10clMxSTB4WS1HUy1pLUF3RG90Skd0djZmSFJ2empINE02a2VBRGRCZ2J0a3VmNWpfSEJRaWtwMEtFanFTMUxsRDlvZUNfZW1PVHF6cmRwNmZZbXZfTzNMb1BBalFaWkNwMUg0VlZ4ZFNzejU2M3NHZQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Exactly How To Reduce Inflammation In The Body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Hearst Owned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If inflammation were a person, we’d picture her as a confident power woman, AirPods in and belting Mariah Carey’s &lt;em&gt;“Why &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;you so obsessed with meeee?” &lt;/em&gt;That’s because the wellness world is hooked on everything anti-inflammatory—from &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a30754055/float-therapy-sensory-deprivation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:spa treatments;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;spa treatments&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a40993140/adaptogenic-mushrooms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:adaptogenic herbs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;adaptogenic herbs&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63865851/msm-supplements/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recovery supplements;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;recovery supplements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put plainly, inflammation is your body’s response to inside threats, like an injury—and too much of it can sabotage your health. But let’s take a step back: There’s a bad &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a good kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Inflammation is often mentioned as a dirty word, but it can be lifesaving if you have an infection,” says Robert Shmerling, MD, clinical chief of rheumatology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protective stuff he’s referring to is acute inflammation, which is the temporary redness, pain, and swelling that crop up as the result of, say, a bug bite or a sprained ankle. Chronic inflammation, on the other hand, is the naughty player, and the one experts are referring to when they talk about inflammation as a main driver of disease. It’s like a slow burn in the immune system, simmering over time and silently wreaking havoc on organs, joints, and blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/authors/robert-h-shmerling-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Robert Shmerling, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Robert Shmerling, MD&lt;/a&gt;, is the clinical chief of rheumatology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School. &lt;a href="https://www.hss.edu/physicians_metzl-jordan.asp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jordan Metzl, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jordan Metzl, MD&lt;/a&gt;, is a sports medicine physician at the Hospital for Special Surgery. &lt;a href="https://jamesgraymd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:James Gray, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;James Gray, MD&lt;/a&gt;, is a cardiologist with Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truth: You can defend against chronic inflammation on your own, no gimmicks required. Just familiarize yourself with the proven health habits that help keep chronic inflammation under control ahead, then adjust your habits (but for real this time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Do your best to get at least seven hours of sleep most nights.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You snuggle in bed with your love (that is, your iPad with the HBO app open) at 11 and pass out during episode three. Next thing you know? Your 6 a.m. alarm is popping off. You’re not getting enough shut-eye, which means you could be fanning chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing sleep to four hours for just one night has been shown to elevate inflammatory markers in the body, research has shown. (No surprise, then, that sleep deprivation is associated with elevated risks for hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try this: &lt;/strong&gt;Most adults need seven to nine hours a night. (Yeah, yeah, you know this.) So your goal now is to, er, actually make that happen. Try the reverse alarm: Just like you set an alarm to wake up, schedule a lights-out alert to nudge yourself to your pillow—sans gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Floss regularly (for real!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation associated with gingivitis and gum disease appears to be linked to chronic inflammation elsewhere in the body. Other recurring infections (e.g., &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a18714095/uti-symptoms-in-women/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UTIs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UTIs&lt;/a&gt;) may also be connected to widespread internal damage, though it’s unclear why. Gum disease stands out, though, because it’s common and doesn’t necessarily cause glaring symptoms, so not everyone takes it seriously and gets it treated, Dr. Shmerling explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try this:&lt;/strong&gt; Standard string-cleaning-turned-bloody-gums doesn’t make this aspect of dental care any more inviting. We get it. But not all flosses are created equal. Shop around and ask your dentist for recs that feel gentle on the gums, as opposed to sharp and plastic-like. Just can’t commit to the string kind? Try tiny interdental brushes (the mini bristles may be more pleasant) or a water flosser. When flossing doesn’t feel like torture, Dr. Shmerling says, you’re more likely to do it twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Woven Dental Floss&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084RSJZY6?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.64040296%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$36.00 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$36.00 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cordless Rechargeable Portable Water Flosser&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C2QZQFQ?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.64040296%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$69.99 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$69.99 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Glide Ultra Deep Clean Floss Picks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DJFWS5DV?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.64040296%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$14.91 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$14.91 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Practice regular workout recovery.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't know for certain yet if your power barre class is any better or worse for icing the internal burn than a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g30985585/hiit-workout-at-home/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HIIT session;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;HIIT session&lt;/a&gt; or run. But we do know that consistent moderate physical activity is probably one of the top ways to quell chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, overexerting yourself during all workouts and skipping rest time impedes your body’s healing process and can backfire: “Chronic inflammation can promote tissue breakdown and encourage muscle atrophy,” says Jordan Metzl, MD, a sports medicine physician at the Hospital for Special Surgery. (Rest day, is that you?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try this: &lt;/strong&gt;There’s no be-all and end-all rehab prescription to undo inflammation from workout overload. Slate regular days off and plan for other forms of physical recovery (such as massage, foam rolling, and hot and cold therapy) that work for you to balance out intense sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Implement consistent stress-management tools into your life.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress has been connected to heart disease, heart attacks, diabetes, and frequent infections—and inflammation in the system is thought to be the bridge for all. Anger, too, may elevate inflammatory markers, according to a new study by the American Psychological Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try this: &lt;/strong&gt;Deliberately planning for taxing or irritating situations could help buffer the negative feels before they hit, research shows. “Stress is more of a perceived reaction,” says James Gray, MD, a cardiologist with Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine. “The situation doesn’t change, but you can alter how you respond.” In your calendar, use another color to highlight events you anticipate being emotionally demanding, so you can make a mental note about what’s coming, prepare your mind, and schedule extra self-care time accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Prioritize eating whole foods.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably seen the term “&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a38148129/anti-inflammatory-diet-benefits-tips/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-inflammatory diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;anti-inflammatory diet&lt;/a&gt;.” But the eating regimen doesn’t need such a formal title (#marketing).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This diet doesn’t have one specific outline, but more generally includes foods that support the body by providing the vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that keep our systems working properly, says Ginger Hultin, RDN, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try this:&lt;/strong&gt; Living by basic nutritious eating rules—going hard in the produce aisle, dialing back on white bread—means your diet is on its way to being anti-inflammatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How To Know If Your Inflammation Levels Are In A Healthy Range&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can’t exactly see or feel chronic inflammation; it’s happening internally. So you may wonder if you need some sort of workup from an MD to scan for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer: not if you’re healthy, says Dr. Shmerling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no easy, reliable way to know if heat is building, and the medical tests available are really meant for people with known risk factors for chronic illnesses associated with inflammation, like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. (The most common scan for inflammatory markers like these is the C-reactive protein test.) You don’t need a high-tech exam if you’re owning our advice and seeing a doc for your usual checkups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 13:14:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE10clMxSTB4WS1HUy1pLUF3RG90Skd0djZmSFJ2empINE02a2VBRGRCZ2J0a3VmNWpfSEJRaWtwMEtFanFTMUxsRDlvZUNfZW1PVHF6cmRwNmZZbXZfTzNMb1BBalFaWkNwMUg0VlZ4ZFNzejU2M3NHZQ</guid></item><item><title>Surgeons Can Implant Teeth In Blind Patients’ Eyes To Restore Their Sight - IFLScience</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPYklreHZNT25vaXl2TUN3YUxBdHdoVWVwbld3YnlzUkR0d19HazBvSW5CdnM1LWR4cjFOd0JseTllcVp0aEl4cThWLVd6QXNaM2ZVRDVEbXllV2l4N3hXSkdPYmxLaWZvLWE1bGluWTM4Vm5rWEtfYzVHVXNhbFhabkZ2emdBM0ZXYmZPc1RtNHRWSVAtTWJQem5zZW40RDFWY0tNTXJQWFo?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content"&gt;&lt;p id="isPasted"&gt;For the first time in Canada, surgeons have successfully carried out the first stage of a procedure involving implanting a tooth into the eyes of people with a type of severe blindness in the hopes of restoring their vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The operation o known as osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis, or “tooth-in-eye” surgery – was recently &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/helpstpauls/posts/1040535244776264?ref=embed_post" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;carried out&lt;/a&gt; at Mount Saint Joseph Hospital in Vancouver in three patients with severe corneal blindness. The cornea is the clear outer layer at the front of the eye that allows light to enter and be focused; in people with corneal blindness, this layer is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9643016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;scarred&lt;/a&gt;, affecting its transparency and thus their ability to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.milwaukeeeyecare.com/news/tooth-in-your-eye/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Tooth-in-eye surgery&lt;/a&gt; aims to change that in the space of just two surgeries. The first step is two-fold; one part sees the removal of the patient’s cornea and any scar tissue, replaced with tissue taken from their cheek. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This first step also involves the creation of the implant. This involves the extraction of one of the patient’s &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/medicine-for-regrowing-teeth-to-be-tested-on-humans-for-the-first-time-74777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;teeth&lt;/a&gt;, which is shaved down into a rectangle with a hole drilled into it that will hold a plastic optical lens. The crafted tooth is then placed inside the patient’s cheek, where it stays for around three months in order to develop new tissue and a blood supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="social-disclaimer-para"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="social-disclaimer-para"&gt;&lt;span class="social-disclaimer-icon"&gt;ⓘ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="social-disclaimer"&gt;IFLScience is not responsible for content shared from external sites.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once that’s happened, in the second stage, surgeons remove the implant from the cheek and put it into the eye, where the plastic lens allows light through, restoring the patient’s vision. “It’s like replacing the windshield on a car when it’s totally frosted over,” Dr Greg Moloney, who led the Canadian surgeries, told the &lt;a href="https://vancouversun.com/health/vancouver-surgeon-uses-blind-womans-tooth-restore-vision" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Vancouver Sun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might sound a bit gross to put someone’s tooth in their eye, but it actually makes a lot of sense; both the fact that teeth are super hard and that it’s the patient’s own tooth increase the chances that the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/sight-restoring-eye-implant-gets-people-with-vision-loss-reading-and-doing-crosswords-76560" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;implant&lt;/a&gt; will last long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The procedure isn’t completely risk-free, Moloney told CBC Radio’s &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/tooth-in-eye-surgery-canada-1.7470626" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;As It Happens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but “there is no risk of rejection, because we're using part of the patient's own body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trio of patients are set to undergo the second surgery later this year. One of those patients, Gail Chapman, was the first to receive the initial surgery and is hopeful of what the procedure could mean for her future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I haven’t seen myself for 10 years,” Chapman told the Vancouver Sun. “If I’m fortune enough to get some sight back, there will be wonderful things to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this was a Canadian first, tooth-in-eye surgery is far from new. It’s been around &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sj.bdj.2013.383" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;since the 1960s&lt;/a&gt;, when it was pioneered by Italian ophthalmologist Professor Benedetto Strampelli, and was later refined into the procedure that it is today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 13:12:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPYklreHZNT25vaXl2TUN3YUxBdHdoVWVwbld3YnlzUkR0d19HazBvSW5CdnM1LWR4cjFOd0JseTllcVp0aEl4cThWLVd6QXNaM2ZVRDVEbXllV2l4N3hXSkdPYmxLaWZvLWE1bGluWTM4Vm5rWEtfYzVHVXNhbFhabkZ2emdBM0ZXYmZPc1RtNHRWSVAtTWJQem5zZW40RDFWY0tNTXJQWFo</guid></item><item><title>I've Taken Antidepressants For 20 Years.

I changed into a gown and beige grippy socks in a hallway with a flimsy curtain drawn around an alcove. Stripped of my clothing and my dignity, I was escorted into the hospital psych ward, where I was left on my own for over an hour to stare at the walls and listen to the distressed voices of the other patients. They were elsewhere in their own little rooms, also bare of anything they could use to hurt themselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m not crazy, right? I mean, I don’t belong here, do I?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; It was a momentary snap out of the deep depression and spiraling thoughts that I had been experiencing for the previous month. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;When I had told my mom earlier that day that I was having thoughts of suicide, she called my primary care doctor’s office. They refused to see me and told her to take me directly to the emergency room. There I also told staff I was considering ending my life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When the psychiatrist arrived, he saw a young woman of 23 who had her prime childbearing years ahead of her. At least, that’s what he must have seen, because what he told me was that I was at risk for postpartum depression, a bizarre observation to make to someone who was most definitely not pregnant. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Worse, that warning was all he would provide. Since I didn’t come in on the heels of a suicide attempt — only with suicidal ideation — there was no place for me in the hospital. He refused to prescribe any medication. I was discharged and sent home with a several thousand dollar ER bill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Three years prior, I had been prescribed an antidepressant for the first time. I had been experiencing what I now know was depression and anxiety for a number of years. But mental health wasn’t really something that was discussed in my family. And in our conservative Christian circles, where mental health issues were seen as a result of not having enough faith, taking medication was actively disparaged. It was only when my parents saw my paralyzing anxiety growing and heard me crying myself to sleep at night that it was considered as an option. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And antidepressants did help, until several years later when a doctor (who wasn’t a psychiatrist) convinced me I should go off medication. Since I was surrounded by a community and had a boyfriend who stigmatized and shamed me for taking an antidepressant, it seemed like a good idea at the time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The results were devastating. Due to the combination of going off the medication and a breakup with the aforementioned boyfriend, I plunged into a depression and extreme anxiety unlike any I had ever experienced before.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was at the bottom of a deep, dark hole and couldn’t see my way out. Therapy on its own wasn’t working because the depression felt so oppressive. I couldn’t take advantage of exercise to boost my mood because most days it was an accomplishment to simply get out of bed. I felt so hopeless and filled with self-hatred that I wondered what the point was anymore. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My visit to the ER was my first taste of how broken the mental healthcare system is in our country. You can be begging for help, only to have doctors refuse to see you and others send you home with no resources. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I had people that were in the position to advocate for me and find me help, because I was not in the place to do it myself. I spent two weeks in an outpatient program at a psychiatric hospital. I was numb, simply going through the motions. I can’t really tell you what the benefits of that program were other than it gave me access to prescriptions and an appointment with a psychiatrist to see after the program was over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trying to go back on the original antidepressant didn’t work. So I spent months trying to find the appropriate psychiatrist and medications that would allow me to function and actually participate in life again. One of the medications that finally helped was a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or SSRI — an antidepressant that increases levels of serotonin in the brain. That SSRI saved my life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being on an SSRI didn’t cure me of the depression and anxiety. But it did clear the fog, help manage the symptoms, and give me a light and ladder out of that deep, dark hole I was in. A hole that made me feel worthless and had me questioning whether my life had meaning or whether everyone else would be better off without me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;SSRIs allowed me to function again. I could eat, sleep and concentrate. I could work again: first part time and eventually full time. They got me to a place where I could actually participate in therapy so I could dive into the underlying causes of depression and work on techniques to combat anxiety when it occurred. I could take a walk out in the fresh air without feeling exhausted after five minutes. I could spend time with friends and actually laugh without feeling dead inside. I was hopeful about the future again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;SSRIs are responsible for another life as well — my daughter’s. Without them, I would have never met her father or been able to consider having children. But after her birth, the words that the ER doctor had spoken almost 10 years prior were fulfilled — unfortunately, I did experience postpartum depression (and anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder). And the medication that I had been taking for almost as long stopped working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days after my daughter was born, it really set in. One night, she screamed and fed the entire time. I was tired — so, so tired. I didn’t want to hear her cry anymore. It felt like she was screaming at me that I was a bad mom. I was exhausted, which triggered more anxiety and the feeling of being so nauseous that I couldn’t eat. On one drive home alone from the store, I was weighing the options of just driving away and never coming back or driving into a building and ending it all. I felt like my daughter and husband would be better off without me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It got so bad that I felt like I was crawling out of my skin. I hadn’t slept in a week; I was hardly eating anything. I called my psychiatrist for help to find a new medication, then called my mom to come help take care of my daughter for the weekend because I felt incapable of even taking care of myself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While it took months for me to get to a better place, my new antidepressant and other complementary medications are the reason I’m still here six years later. They’re the reason that my daughter has a mom. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So when I read the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="“Make America Healthy Again” executive order" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67bdfe29e4b0d509934a6b58" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Make America Healthy Again” executive order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which states that the current administration will be “assessing the prevalence of and threat posed by” drugs such as SSRIs, antipsychotics and mood stabilizers, I wanted to vomit. A friend texted me, “He can’t really take our meds, right?” when she heard that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a man with no medical background and a known vaccine skeptic, had been confirmed as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the executive order specifically refers to investigating what it believes is the overprescribing of these drugs to children, I am not naive enough to believe that it will stop there. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When Kennedy was asked about his stance on antidepressants during his confirmation hearing, he responded that they are “more difficult to come off than heroin,” which is &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5281164/antidepressants-ssris-rfk-jr-heroin" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="blatantly false" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67bdfe29e4b0d509934a6b58" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5281164/antidepressants-ssris-rfk-jr-heroin" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;blatantly false&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, he also hypothesized that the rise in school shootings could be related to antidepressant use, a statement that also &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31513302/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="has no scientific backing" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67bdfe29e4b0d509934a6b58" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31513302/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;has no scientific backing&lt;/a&gt;. And in his first speech to HHS staff, he directly referenced SSRIs and psychiatric drugs as a factor that will be investigated as a cause for a rise in chronic diseases. This is a man who has expressed the desire to send people like us to “wellness camps” to detox from our meds and treat our mental health problems with farm work and organic vegetables. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who has anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder, it is hard not to agonize over even the possibility of access to my medications being denied. But even without outright bans, both Kennedy’s and &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/donald-trump"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;’s policies and statements make clear that they believe that mentally ill, disabled, neurodivergent and chronically ill individuals are a drain on the United States’ resources. This is concerning and also eerily reminiscent of other times in history &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-psychiatric-treatment/article/psychiatry-and-the-dark-side-eugenics-nazi-and-soviet-psychiatry/5A5950F52D74D0B5FC5418642C5211D1" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="when eugenic ideologies prevailed" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67bdfe29e4b0d509934a6b58" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-psychiatric-treatment/article/psychiatry-and-the-dark-side-eugenics-nazi-and-soviet-psychiatry/5A5950F52D74D0B5FC5418642C5211D1" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;when eugenic ideologies prevailed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking medication for mental illness already holds a fair amount of stigma. Many people already feel ashamed for taking medications for their mental health; many more may not even consider medication as an option for fear of being judged or stereotyped as crazy or weak. That is only going to increase as a result of this mindset, along with the stigma surrounding mental illness in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because if you believe that mental illness is not real illness, that depression can be vanquished with a little fresh air and time spent with friends, or that anxiety is a result of “unresolved sin” or not enough faith, then medication is not needed at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This will undoubtedly result in fewer individuals seeking out the treatment they need. And like I almost did, people will lose their lives as a result.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;Go Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next four years will change America forever.

If there’s some new virus circulating, you’ll know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Doctors might have more specific readouts of what viruses and bacteria are circulating in their communities, so they would know what to look for in exam rooms, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Among people who analyze wastewater, there has been a call to standardize how samples are collected and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The more it is standardized, the easier it will be to draw direct comparisons between different places,” Johnson said. “It’s going to be hard, though. We have the CDC, but really, we have 50 states that each have their own health departments that make their own decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Setting up a global system would help track pathogens as soon as they emerge. Officials can also look back at archived samples, as the CDC researchers did in the report last week, to see if a variant arrived in recent weeks or months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Yet the Trump administration has halted federal and international funding for research and fired many employees tasked with tracking outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Trump has also announced his intention to withdraw from the World Health Organization, which means the US would be further isolated from global experts tracking and responding to disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This kind of study is a testament to the fact that international collaboration is crucial,” Vespignani said. “There is no border for viruses, and if we want to have a good grasp on the circulation of pathogens, we need to work collaboratively in the international community. There is no other way to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Wastewater monitoring was “the next generation” approach for understanding infectious diseases, Vespignani said, before adding: “Our effort is towards not being blindsided by another pathogen in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 13:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxQQ1cyR1BiTkFheGIydXJmaUEwSE5MckV2VWo5OE92RzFtbmtFellCRmFrOWtyd0pFeUEzOFNjZHRhY0VaLVkzTnkweUtHYmxzOFlxSXl2RDhPODZQdWVGUHhQNmdMUEV1MTkzVFlLRElReWhWbFpjcnRHNlA4U3cxTDNSYW1PbUE</guid></item><item><title>Paxlovid may not reduce hospitalization risk for vaccinated older adults - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxNM0JrTEdXYkZzbDdNbWFjdVBMZzF1Tkg3TjJSbDY2SEpqdnB0MUlYZHhuTmJDcmFUWm95QXg0SW1qUDNzTGw4OUZXOUFILThYTXpzRGJkQkdLNnRfTXhzUGp1eHBQaEpvSU5WM3h6Zm94VS1SQTJDelRWclJoNGFjSFRybnVLMnAyd2V3aXpQOHRpbkVzSndJX09TdXVDS1dOakFGVnFB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DUGPZRQ24FDCFD5UBPHGM53WAI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Paxlovid, the five-day antiviral treatment for covid, may not reduce the risk of covid-related hospitalizations and all-cause deaths in vaccinated older adults, a new &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2830683"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WLETF6OXUNAFZPP7BBIHNFOFCA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Paxlovid — Pfizer’s combination of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir — has been found to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35172054/"&gt;reduce&lt;/a&gt; symptoms, hospitalizations and deaths in unvaccinated, at-risk patients.

A frail, immunosuppressed and vaccinated 70-year-old man has more reason to take Paxlovid than a vaccinated person the same age who’s healthy and physically active, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GIHV2P52OZF6ZKEZ7BEEFT4TPI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If you’re immunosuppressed, if you have cancer, chemotherapy, if you are frail, if you’re living in a nursing home, if you have end-stage kidney disease, if you’re an organ transplant recipient, those are very high-risk conditions,” Mafi said. “I would be more cautious in those groups.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="BB5NWTZMF5EQ3ETBAH5SCQFT3I" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="BB5NWTZMF5EQ3ETBAH5SCQFT3I"&gt;How was the study conducted?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UVH52LUKNNBBVCV72SB4M2U6D4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers at UCLA and the University of Toronto examined the aggregate health data of more than 1.6 million older adults, ages 65 to 74, living in Ontario between April and November of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RMNYXLV2FNGQJACUQLV6IB7S2I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At the time, Paxlovid was only available for adults age 70 and older in Ontario, as well as the immunocompromised and some patients with&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;certain &lt;a href="https://news.ontario.ca/en/release/1002011/ontario-expanding-access-to-covid-19-antivirals" target="_blank"&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt;.

Paxlovid may not have been as effective for them as it would have been for a person who was sicker with covid, said Jena, who was not involved in the JAMA study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="46ALXQ7FWVCRNLWD4QPPNBDBEY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/peter.chin-hong"&gt;Peter Chin-Hong&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of California at San Francisco, who wasn’t involved in the research, said the population studied doesn’t include people most at risk of ending up in the hospital — adults 75 and older who haven’t been recently vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2ILT3XLNK5FLJLXGV3QSWOZZ5Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I can’t extend the findings of this data to that population,” Chin-Hong said. “It isn’t addressing the people who are in the hospital in the last year or two.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 12:32:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNM0JrTEdXYkZzbDdNbWFjdVBMZzF1Tkg3TjJSbDY2SEpqdnB0MUlYZHhuTmJDcmFUWm95QXg0SW1qUDNzTGw4OUZXOUFILThYTXpzRGJkQkdLNnRfTXhzUGp1eHBQaEpvSU5WM3h6Zm94VS1SQTJDelRWclJoNGFjSFRybnVLMnAyd2V3aXpQOHRpbkVzSndJX09TdXVDS1dOakFGVnFB</guid></item><item><title>Instead of vaccines, RFK Jr. focuses on unconventional measles treatments, driving worries about misinformation - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxNUm9ZdW1LaUE3MUpwZ21iRTJld3BzazctSW0xQ3g1RUhJbGRtVnctLV90RUp4YXR6aG1UTmgxYk0yeGt6MGRKTUdISVBzVTZFRERKc0VNLUs1dFZYc1NDbVl6QjRMM3FHWDVZTkNxZWYxRk1DTTB6ZWl5R1RsN0U3MjVZdkZ2ZU5vaktnbzdn0gGEAUFVX3lxTE80OXlaVUpEYU52QVhBaTRiX1J5bXk2Rlo1WXVQWXJPaWpjOUFFRFRBMWxDOHFQWlMteUhSb1RPZVBHb2FrSXpZWDhPLWtNVGdNS3hhVGRac1lFcGplMHNLMFRfYjlBNE0wMlJHU2d2NGhkalZZclJlZlRQZTRGOWI1SHFzOQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            As a measles outbreak in West Texas continues to grow, the response from US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has leaned heavily on treatment with vitamin A, as well as “good results” from the use of the steroid budesonide, the antibiotic clarithromycin and cod liver oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7uxzy3b00023b5vev1grz2k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors say that this messaging might take away from efforts to increase vaccination, and some misinformation about these therapies is already circulating online.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7vu64dt00043b6mxgersl9d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many US doctors have never seen measles, given that the virus was declared eliminated in the country in 2000. There are no antiviral medications specifically to treat measles infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7te8xxb00053b5vo357lxum@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Vitamin A is not a substitute for vaccination,” said Dr. Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7thyz9b00053b5v1vm67lj7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; recommends two doses for all children and adults who are diagnosed with measles. Guidance from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; also says vitamin A should be given to children with severe measles, such as those who are hospitalized, and specifies doses based on age.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7thz3ko00083b5vii44tep9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt;opinion piece&lt;/a&gt; published Sunday on Fox News, Kennedy referenced &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/39/suppl_1/i48/699532?login=false" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; that show that vitamin A can “dramatically reduce measles mortality.” Speaking to Fox News on Tuesday, Kennedy described how CDC has been on the ground in West Texas and discussed the use of cod liver oil, which has high amounts of vitamins A and D.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ti7i2x000m3b5va4q9970a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, vitamin A is most useful for measles support in patients who have a specific deficiency. The studies mainly draw on evidence from low-income countries where that deficiency is common.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ti7cup000g3b5vosw1k2o2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s actually valid information,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, but it is “out of context.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7tj1zhk00073b6mtvyodkit@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Vitamin A supplementation can be lifesaving for measles cases when vitamin A deficiency is present,” he said. In these cases, it strengthens the immune system in providing a response against the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ti7g9l000j3b5vjinv2glh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in the American context, the data for vitamin A use in measles is “weak,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7uy581w00053b5v17xkvlpi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vitamin A “really doesn’t have much of a role in the current discussion on the West Texas measles epidemic because it becomes a distraction about what we really need to focus on, which is vaccinating our kids,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7uymdud00003b6mhhmvqj2g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beyond the updated CDC guidelines on vitamin A, there’s no set treatment regimen for measles because cases in the US have been generally rare. One of the medications that Kennedy mentioned, the antibiotic clarithromycin, could be an attempt to prevent secondary bacterial infections like pneumonia, but&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7055587/" target="_blank"&gt; evidence&lt;/a&gt; for that is limited. Budesonide is a steroid with a variety of uses, but it’s not clear how it might help someone with measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ur7zv300003b5v0uycyc5f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s really important not to conflate what … [is] supportive or adjunctive care for measles versus curative treatment for measles,” said Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency physician at PM Pediatrics in Annapolis, Maryland. “There is no treatment for measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7us0a2f00083b5vw5kkp7p0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I believe that it is incredibly important to speak very clearly and directly with regard to therapy,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The American Academy of Pediatrics &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/31490/AAP-leaders-combating-misinformation-amid-measles?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank"&gt;released comments&lt;/a&gt; last week seeking to combat misinformation that says vitamin A can prevent measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Vitamin A is only recommended in hospitalized patients, and it’s only recommended at specific doses,” said Dr. Leslie Motheral, a pediatrician in Lubbock, Texas, where the measles outbreak is growing. “I want to be very clear with that, because I do think there are patients who are not vaccinating and are just giving their kids high doses of vitamin A.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7te8xxb00073b5v9c57opsy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Motheral said she has started seeing misinformation about vitamin A on social media and wants to inform people that it cannot be used as measles prevention. Excess amounts of vitamin A can even be dangerous.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7te8xxb00083b5vg27w5n71@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As pediatricians … we learn about vitamin A toxicity, but now we’ve got to really make sure we’re watching for those things in these patients,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7te8xxb00093b5vkda798yq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            The measles outbreak in West Texas stands at 159 cases as of Tuesday, according to the Texas Department of Health Services. Many are in Gaines County, home to a high number of unvaccinated people, including a Mennonite community. One unvaccinated school-age child has died. Experts say the case count is probably far greater than what has been reported.

            Some Texas residents have decided to get vaccinated, which experts attribute to access to good information.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Those who are choosing vaccination are getting “vaccine questions answered by medical and public health professionals rather than purveyors of disinformation on social media,” Dr. Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock Public Health, and Dr. Phil Huang, director of health and human services in Dallas County, wrote in an &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-texas-mmr-vaccine/81146579007/" target="_blank"&gt;opinion &lt;/a&gt;piece in a USA Today.

            Kennedy, who has a history of anti-vaccine activism, has said little about vaccination. He did not explicitly recommend the vaccine in his opinion piece on Fox News, calling the decision to vaccinate “a personal one,” and acknowledging it can contribute to “community immunity.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7vutpk1000c3b6miyeg9etx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Kennedy’s interview on Tuesday, he said measles vaccination, “in highly unvaccinated communities like the Mennonites, it’s something we recommend, but we also understand there is a lot of mistrust of the vaccines.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

In agricultural communities, children can be even further exposed to multiple pesticides in water, air, dust, and in the home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Exposure to a 10% mixture increased brain cancer rates by 36%, leukemia rates by 23%, and overall pediatric cancer rates by 30% in Nebraska, the study found. The cancers are among the most common in the state, and may help explain their prevalence, said Jabeen Taiba, a lead author with the University of Nebraska Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“As individuals, we aren’t just exposed to one chemical, but a mixture, so if you are just studying one chemical alone, then you are not able to capture the exposures – it gives you limited information,” Taiba told the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The study investigated cancer data from 2,500 pediatric cases across 22 years in Nebraska, which is in the nation’s agricultural heartland. It holds the US’s second highest childhood cancer rates, in part due to widespread use of multiple pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Of the 32 pesticides researchers examined, they found the most potent mixes were among herbicides such as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/24/epa-monsanto-toxic-herbicides-dicamba" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;dicamba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/17/glyphosate-weedkiller-sperm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;glyphosate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/11/epa-reapprove-paraquat-herbicide-parkinsons" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;paraquat&lt;/a&gt; – controversial products that are each sprayed on tens of millions of acres of cropland nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The pesticides have drawn intense scrutiny for their toxicity, and are prohibited in many other countries, but regulators here have resisted calls for bans. Pesticides are especially dangerous for children because they are smaller than adults and their bodies are still developing, so health risks can be considerable at a smaller exposure level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The greatest risk is for farm workers and people living in agricultural communities, but children’s exposure in food presents an underestimated danger, Taiba said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We are exposed to multiple pesticides through water and food, so this is not just a problem for the agricultural communities,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Although the problem’s solution lies in changes in regulatory structure, which will take into account the toxicity of exposure to multiple substances, people can take steps to protect themselves. Taiba recommends buying organic foods when possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Pesticide pollution of water sources in some communities is also common, and people could research levels in their water, then buy water filtration systems that are effective at removing the substances. Reverse osmosis and granular activated carbon systems are considered the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In agricultural communities, adults who work around pesticides should leave their work clothes and shoes outdoors, Taiba said. Previous research has found pesticides tracked or brought into the home is a significant exposure source for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian US</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 12:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQNDl3LVJLVUltMmk0WmxBb0IybnZvdlBFaWpkYXlaTm51MkIwWW5IeDJudUhNZHkzZUt6d0NzM0dCb0gyVzBrVkIwYkFXN2RQS1Q5MU5LaE03dEMxRlpTdzRVMWhfb2hrQVNSSF9JYzlkby1idmM3NU93TWhBRGlmWjNfbzlqaVVj</guid></item><item><title>The 7 Best Canned Foods for Cognitive Health, Recommended by Dietitians - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE02OFFhVDFXamsxX1BFU2w1dFlDUEFVNUJpM290czQ4b3dBZ2JBazJXOUpBN180bEpNU1Rkb3hxbHFGN3FsaDR2Q0dVekFSMUgtX3lOb3hFYUlPNGVxSGNOd3RCMU1SWGFabVB3ZTZ4YndHQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewed by Dietitian Maria Laura Haddad-Garcia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty Images. EatingWell design. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to supporting brain health, the right foods can make all the difference—and you don’t even have to look beyond your pantry. While fresh ingredients often steal the spotlight, canned foods offer a convenient, budget-friendly way to nourish your mind with essential nutrients. From omega-3-rich fish to antioxidant-packed vegetables, the right choices can help support memory, focus and long-term cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Foods that contribute key nutrients to support cognitive health can absolutely come out of a can,” affirms &lt;a href="https://culinahealth.com/registered-dietitian/meredith-rofheart/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Meredith Rofheart, M.S., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Meredith Rofheart, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist. “The canning process helps preserve essential nutrients, making canned foods a convenient, long-lasting, and often more affordable source of brain-boosting micronutrients—such as omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, vitamin K, fiber, and antioxidants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you're stocking up for busy weeks or simply looking for easy ways to eat smarter, these seven dietitian-approved canned foods will fuel cognitive function and help keep your brain sharp and thriving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Canned Fish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canned salmon, tuna, anchovies and mackerel are all high in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3 fatty acids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, making them great sources of food for cognitive health. “Omega-3 fatty acids are components of brain cell membranes critical for cognitive functioning,” says Rofheart. “They’re anti-inflammatory and vital for maintaining normal brain processing.” Plus, research suggests positive effects on symptoms of depression and reducing risk of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For canned fish, Rofheart says to choose options that are packed in water or extra virgin olive oil, and are labeled as wild-caught or safe-caught (meaning the fish is caught using sustainable fishing practices and has been tested for contaminants).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Canned Tomatoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-tomatoes-good-for-you-8636976" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tomatoes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt; are a top source of lycopene, a powerful antioxidant that helps protect brain cells from oxidative damage. “Lycopene has been associated with a lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's,” says Melinda “Mindi” Manuel, RD, a registered dietitian. “Interestingly, the heat from the canning process actually increases the bioavailability of lycopene, making canned tomatoes even more beneficial than fresh ones, in this regard.” However, more research is needed to confirm the neuroprotective effects of lycopene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manuel suggests blending canned tomatoes into homemade pasta sauce, chili, soups, stews or casseroles to maximize lycopene intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Canned Mandarin Oranges&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Citrus contains unique antioxidants, including hesperidin and nobiletin, both of which have been shown to have neuroprotective effects on the brain,” says registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://mandyenright.com/meet-mandy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mandy Enright, M.S., RDN, RYT;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mandy Enright, M.S., RDN, RYT&lt;/a&gt;. “It may prevent against many cognitive disorders, including depression, dementia, Alzheimer's and memory loss.” While these nutrients are primarily found in the peels and white piths of citrus, consuming canned citrus like mandarin oranges can still be an adequate source of these key brain-protecting nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Canned Spinach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leafy greens like spinach are great &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-rich-in-vitamin-k-8635254" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sources of vitamin K;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sources of vitamin K&lt;/a&gt;, folate, beta-carotene and lutein, which Rofheart says contribute to neuroprotective pathways, helping to support cognitive function and helping to slow decline. “They’re also anti-inflammatory, helping to reduce inflammation in the brain,” she says. Further, studies show that even one serving per day can positively affect brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When shopping for canned spinach, Rofheart recommends looking for cans that say “low sodium” or “no salt added” to help &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7882895/easy-ways-to-cut-sodium-in-your-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:keep your sodium intake in check;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;keep your sodium intake in check&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Canned Beans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canned beans are a kitchen staple thanks to their affordability and high protein count. And &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291111/the-10-best-vegan-protein-sources/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plant-based sources of protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;plant-based sources of protein&lt;/a&gt;, like beans, are associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rofheart points to another study showing that a higher dietary intake of B vitamins, abundant in beans and legumes, supports enhanced cognitive function. “These essential vitamins play a key role in homocysteine metabolism—an amino acid that, at elevated levels, can impair cognition and heart health,” she explains. “B vitamins help convert homocysteine into methionine, effectively reducing its levels and lowering the risk of adverse brain and heart health outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Canned Pumpkin, Sweet Potatoes and Carrots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do pumpkin, sweet potatoes and carrots all have in common? They are loaded with beta-carotene, a powerful antioxidant. “Beta-carotene helps protect brain cells from oxidative stress and inflammation, which are linked to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases,” says Manuel. “These vegetables also provide essential vitamins and minerals that support overall brain function and health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, she says all three of these vegetables are high in fiber, which plays a crucial role in maintaining brain health through its impact on the gut-brain axis—the communication network that links the gut and the brain, which in turn, benefits your cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Canned Peaches&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rofheart notes that canned peaches are packed with antioxidants, plus other brain-healthy nutrients like fiber and vitamins C and K. “The antioxidants in peaches help to lower oxidative stress and protect the central nervous system,” she says. “Preventing oxidative damage and maintaining a healthy central nervous system are key components in maintaining higher cognitive functioning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When choosing canned peaches, Rofheart says to aim to limit added sugar by choosing fruit canned in water or their natural fruit juice, avoiding those canned in syrup or added juice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canned foods can be a powerhouse for brain health in a convenient, budget-friendly form. From lycopene-rich tomatoes to omega-3-packed canned fish, these pantry staples can help support memory, focus and cognitive function. Many foods, including leafy greens, citrus fruits and fiber-rich beans, further enhance brain health by reducing inflammation and supporting neuroprotective pathways. With smart choices like these, your pantry holds the key to maintaining cognitive wellness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-canned-foods-for-cognitive-health-11690808" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE02OFFhVDFXamsxX1BFU2w1dFlDUEFVNUJpM290czQ4b3dBZ2JBazJXOUpBN180bEpNU1Rkb3hxbHFGN3FsaDR2Q0dVekFSMUgtX3lOb3hFYUlPNGVxSGNOd3RCMU1SWGFabVB3ZTZ4YndHQQ</guid></item><item><title>Measles outbreak in Wisconsin "only a matter of time," experts say - madison365.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxPd3EyU2U2Rm1Wc1dlUjZJVjI0VnZfZUZ4UmxESG95WG5QYzcwUl81T2FiZHF2cnBDRC1mdUxXNDdHbUtvSnRzQUIyR2VnaERWZEhoQVpaS1Z5TUQyMGNZSE9ya3NheWJuWlQ1Q0F1VnlpVnBBcDAyRllmRTNfaHJ1SVpqLThQRUZnd1ZQZ2VNQ2U?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content td-pb-padding-side"&gt;  &lt;div class="td-post-featured-image"&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;img alt="Measles outbreak in Wisconsin “only a matter of time,” experts say" title="Measles outbreak in Wisconsin “only a matter of time,” experts say" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-ilcmpkn.nitrocdn.com/BoGAIwyBcITcAMQhwITCPYMXzVwMRBcZ/assets/images/optimized/rev-228bed0/madison365.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/UWHealthDocs.jpg" class="entry-thumb nitro-lazy" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty id="NzE2OjI5Mg==-1" src=""&gt; &lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Dr. Ajay Sethi and Dr. Nasia Safdar.

So it’s really just a matter of time until we have an outbreak here.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Epidemiologist and University of Wisconsin professor of population health sciences Ajay Sethi agreed, noting that populations must be 95 percent vaccinated to protect against a widespread outbreak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dhsgis.wi.gov/DHS/EPHTracker/#/all/Immunization/immunizationIndex/NOTRACT/Immunization/immunMMR"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wisconsin Department of Health Services data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; indicate that 81.6 percent of Wisconsin children had received at least one dose of measles vaccine as of 2021, a figure that Sethi said has not changed meaningfully since.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Waukesha County had the highest vaccination rate at 88.9 percent, while Vernon County in western Wisconsin had the lowest at 52.9 percent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We don’t have enough children, in particular, who are vaccinated fully against measles to be able to protect our state and communities from a potential outbreak,” he said. “We just don’t have any county that feels like it’s in a safe spot. It starts with one case.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That one case can be hard to catch, Sethi said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Measles is very infectious,” he said. “You’re actually infectious four days before the rash appears, and the symptoms in those four days before it’s more obvious that one person has measles, the symptoms are just not that specific. They’re flu-like symptoms.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Measles can be deadly for everyone, but history has shown that outbreaks disproportionately affect communities of color, where access to healthcare and vaccines is often lacking. A 2004 study found that during the last major measles epidemic, in 1989-91, nonwhite children were four to seven times more likely to contract measles than white children. A series of interventions closed a gap in vaccine coverage, and measles was declared eradicated in 2000.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Twenty-five years later, it’s making a comeback, due in large part to a downward trend in vaccination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The trend does seem to be for people to not get children vaccinated the way that it was just considered the default state,” Safdar said. “I think that’s the worry.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sethi said there’s no reason not to get vaccinated, if you or your children aren’t already.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s never too late,” he said. “I think it’s a great time to (get vaccinated), given we can see what’s happening in Texas, and now there’s a child who died of measles that was 100% preventable.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What about bird flu?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The other infectious disease on the minds of the experts is H5N1, better known as bird flu. That’s the reason eggs are so expensive, and it’s started to infect mammals, too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This broadening of different species that can pick up the virus is concerning because it means it’s just growing and it’s just all around us,” Sethi said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is some good news, though. A few people have contracted H5N1, and it’s been a serious illness, but not fatal. And it doesn’t seem to transmit from person to person, at least not yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We’re assuming that the virus hasn’t mutated into a form where (human-to-human transmission) is possible,” Sethi said. “The strain that people have been picking up from cows has not been fatal. … there are a couple strains out there, and the one that has been enumerated the most, there hasn’t been any fatalities, and the strain that has led to a fatality was a different strain.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The lack of human transition is “a little bit reassuring” to Safdar, but she remains cautious in her optimism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When you do get it, it can turn into a very severe condition,” she said. “That’s the concern, that if things were to change, and that (human to human) transition were easier, then it would be a real problem.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b class="nitro-lazy"&gt;Concern at the federal level&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both Sethi and Safdar expressed concern about the public health implications of recent words and actions by the Trump Administration, where the Health and Human Services Department is led by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, who has long opposed vaccines and vaccine mandates. He recently &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/after-hhs-confirmation-rfk-jr-reverses-pledge-leave-childhood-vaccine-schedules-alone"&gt;&lt;span&gt;said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; an HHS panel would review childhood vaccine schedules.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There’s really no debate in the scientific community about the value of vaccines. You know, you only have to go to a region of the world where you don’t have access to a measles vaccine to see the devastation that measles can cause,” Safdar said. “I think anything that interferes with that message to give people the wrong impression about vaccines is concerning.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sethi also expressed concern about preparedness for next year’s flu season, as the federal Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee’s spring meeting, scheduled for March 13, was abruptly canceled without explanation. At that meeting every year, the committee makes recommendations for the flu strains that will be included in the next flu season’s vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The timing is important,” Sethi said. “The expert panel picks a strain. They work with manufacturers, and then just like clockwork, it takes about six months or so to begin producing the vaccine. And then, of course, there’s distribution. And then it gets ready by mid-September. So by canceling that meeting, it’s going to kind of disrupt this process, and it’s unclear what’s going to happen.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That doesn’t mean there will be no flu shots, necessarily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The best case scenario is that vaccine manufacturers can rely on other sources of expert opinion to decide what to include in the vaccine,” Sethi said. “It might be the World Health Organization, it may be other organizations that have access to the data. The problem with canceling the meeting is that it’s unclear if the meeting is postponed, delayed or just dissolved. And because of the uncertainty, everybody’s kind of frozen in place.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;To get your and your family’s vaccines up to date, contact your primary care provider or, if you don’t have one, your local health department. The State of Wisconsin lists websites and contact information for county health departments &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/lh-depts/index.htm"&gt;&lt;span&gt;at this link.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="zone_load_2037873189"&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone callback="zone_load_2037873189" zone-id="83016" keywords="not_home_page,not_landing_page,is_article_page,featured,health,wisconsin,measles-outbreak-in-wisconsin-only-a-matter-of-time-experts-say,post" soft-keywords="true" zone-alias=""&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;template data-nitro-marker-id="c3482faf74204bf8c3e866c61aab0923-1"&gt;&lt;/template&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>madison365.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 11:59:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPd3EyU2U2Rm1Wc1dlUjZJVjI0VnZfZUZ4UmxESG95WG5QYzcwUl81T2FiZHF2cnBDRC1mdUxXNDdHbUtvSnRzQUIyR2VnaERWZEhoQVpaS1Z5TUQyMGNZSE9ya3NheWJuWlQ1Q0F1VnlpVnBBcDAyRllmRTNfaHJ1SVpqLThQRUZnd1ZQZ2VNQ2U</guid></item><item><title>More Energy, Better Sleep, Balanced Mood: A Spring Reset for Your Hormones - Camille Styles</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE5hb2pJMEhURHZpa0xaNjhYQ0t5VVpQTWlsVEtZX2o1ZVc3Y2NsWlNuV1hMbGJsOHNuMHZxeGpZaVM4YlN2YlZkdVpSV3JvbzByeDZzdkRpbnhDUDMzbFlwZ3ZpRHVuSnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content is-layout-constrained"&gt;
						
&lt;p class="has-drop-cap"&gt;Spring in Colorado doesn’t arrive all at once. It tiptoes in, bringing unpredictable winds and the promise of warmer days. From my desk, clouds race across the sky. The ground is softening. Buds are blooming. And the air is filled with fresh energy. Like clockwork, my body is shifting too. The sluggishness of winter is beginning to lift—and with it, a desire to reset. If you’re feeling called to &lt;a href="https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-balance-hormones/"&gt;support your body&lt;/a&gt; in a new way, it might be time for a spring hormone reset. As a &lt;a href="https://wellnesswithedie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nutrition Consultant&lt;/a&gt;, here’s how I’m nourishing my hormones this season, with simple shifts that make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spring-into-balance"&gt;Spring into Balance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just as we &lt;a href="https://camillestyles.com/design/monthly-declutter/"&gt;declutter our homes&lt;/a&gt; and stow our winter coats, our bodies crave a seasonal tune-up, too—a primal urge to refresh, reset, and realign. After months of heavier meals and sluggish energy, spring is the perfect time to sync with our &lt;a href="https://camillestyles.com/wellness/sleep/how-to-reset-circadian-rhythm/"&gt;natural rhythms&lt;/a&gt;. With that in mind, what does a spring hormone reset look like? It’s not about restrictive detoxes or drastic changes. Instead, it’s about gentle, supportive habits that align with the season. Think nourishing foods, outdoor movement, and &lt;a href="https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-be-more-mindful/"&gt;mindful choices&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-common-symptoms-of-hormone-imbalance"&gt;Common Symptoms of Hormone Imbalance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Spring or not, our &lt;a href="https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-balance-hormones/"&gt;hormones are in constant motion&lt;/a&gt;. But after months of winter comfort foods, less sunlight, and more time indoors, imbalances are more likely to surface. They can manifest as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low energy and afternoon crashes&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Trouble sleeping (or waking up exhausted)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Increased sugar cravings&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Digestive issues like bloating or sluggish metabolism&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Mood swings, anxiety, or feeling “off”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These signs indicate your body is asking for a reset—not a drastic overhaul, but a gentle return to rhythm!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-simple-shifts-for-a-spring-hormone-reset"&gt;6 Simple Shifts for a Spring Hormone Reset&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, a few simple adjustments (to diet, movement, and lifestyle), are all you need to feel your best. As we head into spring, below are six straightforward ways to realign your hormones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Support Your Liver for Better Hormone Detox&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your liver is responsible for clearing out excess hormones—&lt;em&gt;especially &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://camillestyles.com/wellness/foods-that-lower-estrogen/"&gt;estrogen&lt;/a&gt;. When it’s overburdened, you might experience bloating, PMS, or stubborn weight gain. To support detoxification:&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Pair these habits with plenty of hydration to further support your body’s natural detox pathways!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-prioritize-protein-fiber-and-healthy-fats"&gt;2. Prioritize Protein, Fiber, and Healthy Fats&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Balanced blood sugar = balanced hormones. If you’re reaching for carbs first thing in the morning, you’re setting yourself up for energy crashes later. Instead:&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Prioritizing protein, fiber, and healthy fats is the secret to curbing sugar cravings, sustaining energy, and keeping hormones in check.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Sync Your Sleep With Natural Light&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With longer daylight hours, it’s tempting to stay up later. But quality sleep is &lt;em&gt;non-negotiable&lt;/em&gt; for hormone health. Sleep impacts everything from cortisol regulation to appetite hormones and metabolism. Use the spring as a motivator to reset your &lt;a href="https://camillestyles.com/wellness/sleep/how-to-reset-circadian-rhythm/"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;. Try:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting at least 10 minutes of morning sunlight to boost energy and balance cortisol.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;At night, limiting blue light (and bright light) to help melatonin production.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Creating a &lt;a href="https://camillestyles.com/beauty/nighttime-routine-ideas/"&gt;relaxing evening routine&lt;/a&gt; with calming activities. I.e. reading, stretching, or sipping a &lt;a href="https://camillestyles.com/wellness/sleepy-girl-mocktails/"&gt;sleepy girl mocktail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Choosing the right &lt;a href="https://camillestyles.com/wellness/healthy-late-night-snacks/"&gt;late-night snacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Keeping a consistent bedtime—yes, even on weekends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When your sleep aligns with natural light cycles, your hormones follow suit (leading to better energy, mood, and overall well-being).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;4. Move With Intention, Not Exhaustion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Spring invites us to step outside, soak up the sunshine, and move more intuitively. The key? Avoid extremes—no need to overdo high-intensity workouts or force yourself into rigid routines. Instead, embrace variety and movement that supports your cycle and energy levels. This season, focus on:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://camillestyles.com/wellness/weight-bearing-exercises-for-40s/"&gt;Strength training&lt;/a&gt; to support lean muscle mass and balance blood sugar.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://camillestyles.com/wellness/low-impact-exercise/"&gt;Low-impact movement&lt;/a&gt; like walking, yoga, or Pilates for recovery. Plus, flow-based movement supports lymphatic drainage!&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://camillestyles.com/wellness/cycle-syncing/cycle-syncing-workouts/"&gt;Syncing workouts with your cycle&lt;/a&gt;. Think gentler movement during your luteal and menstrual phases, and more strength training/cardio in your follicular and ovulatory phases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Movement should leave you feeling energized, not depleted. By exercising in a way that supports your hormones—rather than working against them—you’ll build strength, resilience, and long-term balance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;5. Reduce Endocrine Disruptors in Your Environment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every day, we’re exposed to chemicals that can interfere with our hormones. These &lt;a href="https://camillestyles.com/wellness/what-are-endocrine-disruptors/"&gt;endocrine disruptors&lt;/a&gt; are found in everything from food packaging and household cleaners to skincare products (and drinking water!). Over time, they can contribute to hormone imbalances, impacting metabolism, fertility, and overall well-being. Thankfully, small changes can make a big difference. Here are easy swaps:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ditch plastic food containers and switch to glass or stainless steel.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Choose organic produce when possible (or follow the &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/clean-fifteen.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Clean 15/Dirty Dozen list&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Use non-toxic beauty and cleaning products to reduce exposure to synthetic chemicals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While we can’t avoid&lt;em&gt; all&lt;/em&gt; toxins, we can make mindful choices to lower our exposure and support long-term hormone health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-refresh-your-morning-routine"&gt;6. Refresh Your Morning Routine&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How you start your day sets the tone for your hormones, energy, and mindset. Instead of diving straight into emails (or &lt;a href="https://camillestyles.com/wellness/when-to-drink-coffee/"&gt;caffeine on an empty stomach&lt;/a&gt;), try a more supportive approach:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First thing in the morning, keep your phone in another room. Avoid the temptation to scroll.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Hydration, hyrdation, hydration. I.e. warm lemon water or a &lt;a href="https://camillestyles.com/food/adrenal-cocktails/"&gt;mineral-rich drink&lt;/a&gt; before coffee.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Eat a &lt;a href="https://edie-s-site.thinkific.com/courses/protein-guide"&gt;protein-packed breakfast&lt;/a&gt;. As mentioned, this stabilizes blood sugar and keeps energy steady.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Incorporate movement (ideally, outside) or mindfulness to &lt;a href="https://camillestyles.com/wellness/daily-journal-prompts/"&gt;ease into the day with intention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Before hopping in the shower, &lt;a href="https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-dry-brush/"&gt;dry brush&lt;/a&gt; to stimulate lymphatic flow and circulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;







&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spring-into-balance-one-step-at-a-time"&gt;Spring Into Balance, One Step at a Time&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This spring hormone reset isn’t about a complete overhaul. It’s about making small, manageable shifts that help you feel lighter, more energized, and in tune with your natural rhythms. Pick one or two habits to start, and let your body guide you from there. Because when you support your hormones, you support &lt;em&gt;yourself&lt;/em&gt;. Here’s to feeling your best this spring!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient: &lt;/strong&gt;A 30-year-old man in Singapore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;The patient visited the emergency room with a bloated stomach and gut pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next: &lt;/strong&gt;When doctors examined the man, they found his abdomen was swollen and distended. They ordered an X-ray but the scan did not reveal any air pockets in the patient's abdominal cavity, which can be a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10400810/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10400810/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;sign of bowel perforation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood tests then showed that the man had elevated levels of immune cells, called white blood cells, in his &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/22486-circulatory-system.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/22486-circulatory-system.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;circulatory system&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and that levels of creatinine and amylase were also higher than normal. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/creatinine-test/" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/creatinine-test/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Creatinine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a waste chemical left over from energy production in muscles, and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003464.htm" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003464.htm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;amylase&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an enzyme that helps digest carbohydrates. An elevated white blood cell count can happen in response to infection, but &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/high-white-blood-cell-count/basics/causes/sym-20050611" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/high-white-blood-cell-count/basics/causes/sym-20050611" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;disease or sudden stress&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can also cause white blood cells to multiply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctors then ordered a computed tomography (CT) scan of the man's abdomen and pelvis, which showed that his stomach and the upper part of his small intestine were "grossly distended with food material," the doctors wrote &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085%2817%2936093-6/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085%2817%2936093-6/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in a report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the case. The man's intestines had been pushed over to the left side of his abdomen, flattening his &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/the-pancreas" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/the-pancreas" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pancreas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;According to the patient, eight hours prior to visiting the emergency room, he had participated in a speed-eating competition. During the contest, he consumed a burger weighing 7 pounds (3.2 kilograms) in just 30 minutes. The man had vomited soon after, regurgitating undigested food but expelling no blood or bile. At the hospital, the doctors determined that the man's symptoms were caused by the sizable burger, which the patient had eaten too quickly for his &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/food-diet/how-long-does-it-take-to-digest-food" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/food-diet/how-long-does-it-take-to-digest-food"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stomach to digest&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;Doctors admitted the patient to the general ward of the hospital. They attempted to relieve the pressure in his stomach through a tube inserted in his nose, which could have helped the excess gas in the digestive tract escape. However, his abdomen remained distended, and the pain continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-xZFLCnjCH3pQ3hmvPFnwtM" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-xZFLCnjCH3pQ3hmvPFnwtM slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctors considered performing a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002937.htm" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002937.htm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;gastrostomy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — surgically opening the stomach through the abdominal wall — to remove the undigested food. However, the patient soon began passing gas, suggesting that his digestive system was starting to catch up and process the huge mass of chewed-up burger. Blood analysis showed that the man's white blood cell count was starting to return to normal. Finally, the patient had a bowel movement. Five days later, his symptoms had fully abated, and he was discharged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;When fully expanded, the average adult's stomach can comfortably hold &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279304/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279304/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;up to 50 ounces (1.5 liters)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, though this varies between individuals. People who regularly compete in eating contests "train" their stomachs to contain more than this average by repeatedly and rapidly stretching the stomach walls "during their gobbling episodes," the doctors wrote in their report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But frequently cramming their stomachs with enormous quantities of food carries serious health risks, the physicians warned. These risks may include injury to the stomach wall or weakening of muscles that move food into the lower intestine; pneumonia from inhaling food particles into the lungs; and in the long term, obesity, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-xZFLCnjCH3pQ3hmvPFnwtM-3nXEat6UTOTb0LxTWxfuxjbbfkQgSSSq" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-xZFLCnjCH3pQ3hmvPFnwtM-3nXEat6UTOTb0LxTWxfuxjbbfkQgSSSq slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But let’s take a step back: There’s a bad &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a good kind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Inflammation is often mentioned as a dirty word, but it can be lifesaving if you have an infection,” says Robert Shmerling, MD, clinical chief of rheumatology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The protective stuff he’s referring to is acute inflammation, which is the temporary redness, pain, and swelling that crop up as the result of, say, a bug bite or a sprained ankle. Chronic inflammation, on the other hand, is the naughty player, and the one experts are referring to when they talk about inflammation as a main driver of disease. It’s like a slow burn in the immune system, simmering over time and silently wreaking havoc on organs, joints, and blood vessels.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="body-tip css-13fzjfi emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/authors/robert-h-shmerling-md" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.health.harvard.edu/authors/robert-h-shmerling-md" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Robert Shmerling, MD" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Robert Shmerling, MD&lt;/a&gt;, is the clinical chief of rheumatology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School. &lt;a href="https://www.hss.edu/physicians_metzl-jordan.asp" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.hss.edu/physicians_metzl-jordan.asp" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jordan Metzl, MD" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Jordan Metzl, MD&lt;/a&gt;, is a sports medicine physician at the Hospital for Special Surgery. &lt;a href="https://jamesgraymd.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://jamesgraymd.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="James Gray, MD" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;James Gray, MD&lt;/a&gt;, is a cardiologist with Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Truth: You can defend against chronic inflammation on your own, no gimmicks required. Just familiarize yourself with the proven health habits that help keep chronic inflammation under control ahead, then adjust your habits (but for real this time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="do-your-best-to-get-at-least-seven-hours-of-sleep-most-nights" data-node-id="7" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;1. Do your best to get at least seven hours of sleep most nights.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="8" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p id data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="body-text css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;You snuggle in bed with your love (that is, your iPad with the HBO app open) at 11 and pass out during episode three. Next thing you know? Your 6 a.m. alarm is popping off. You’re not getting enough shut-eye, which means you could be fanning chronic inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="body-text css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Reducing sleep to four hours for just one night has been shown to elevate inflammatory markers in the body, research has shown. (No surprise, then, that sleep deprivation is associated with elevated risks for hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="body-tip css-13fzjfi emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try this: &lt;/strong&gt;Most adults need seven to nine hours a night. (Yeah, yeah, you know this.) So your goal now is to, er, actually make that happen. Try the reverse alarm: Just like you set an alarm to wake up, schedule a lights-out alert to nudge yourself to your pillow—sans gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="floss-regularly-for-real" data-node-id="12" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;2. Floss regularly (for real!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Inflammation associated with gingivitis and gum disease appears to be linked to chronic inflammation elsewhere in the body. Other recurring infections (e.g., &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a18714095/uti-symptoms-in-women/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a18714095/uti-symptoms-in-women/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="UTIs" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;UTIs&lt;/a&gt;) may also be connected to widespread internal damage, though it’s unclear why. Gum disease stands out, though, because it’s common and doesn’t necessarily cause glaring symptoms, so not everyone takes it seriously and gets it treated, Dr. Shmerling explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="body-tip css-13fzjfi emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try this:&lt;/strong&gt; Standard string-cleaning-turned-bloody-gums doesn’t make this aspect of dental care any more inviting. We get it. But not all flosses are created equal. Shop around and ask your dentist for recs that feel gentle on the gums, as opposed to sharp and plastic-like. Just can’t commit to the string kind? Try tiny interdental brushes (the mini bristles may be more pleasant) or a water flosser. When flossing doesn’t feel like torture, Dr. Shmerling says, you’re more likely to do it twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-embed="embed-gallery" data-lazy-id="P0-16" data-node-id="15" class="embed

But we do know that consistent moderate physical activity is probably one of the top ways to quell chronic inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;In addition, overexerting yourself during all workouts and skipping rest time impedes your body’s healing process and can backfire: “Chronic inflammation can promote tissue breakdown and encourage muscle atrophy,” says Jordan Metzl, MD, a sports medicine physician at the Hospital for Special Surgery. (Rest day, is that you?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="body-tip css-13fzjfi emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try this: &lt;/strong&gt;There’s no be-all and end-all rehab prescription to undo inflammation from workout overload. Slate regular days off and plan for other forms of physical recovery (such as massage, foam rolling, and hot and cold therapy) that work for you to balance out intense sessions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="implement-consistent-stress-management-tools-into-your-life" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;4. Implement consistent stress-management tools into your life.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Stress has been connected to heart disease, heart attacks, diabetes, and frequent infections—and inflammation in the system is thought to be the bridge for all.  Anger, too, may elevate inflammatory markers, according to a new study by the American Psychological Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="body-tip css-13fzjfi emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try this: &lt;/strong&gt;Deliberately planning for taxing or irritating situations could help buffer the negative feels before they hit, research shows. “Stress is more of a perceived reaction,” says James Gray, MD, a cardiologist with Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine. “The situation doesn’t change, but you can alter how you respond.” In your calendar, use another color to highlight events you anticipate being emotionally demanding, so you can make a mental note about what’s coming, prepare your mind, and schedule extra self-care time accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="prioritize-eating-whole-foods" data-node-id="24" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;5. Prioritize eating whole foods. &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;You’ve probably seen the term “&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a38148129/anti-inflammatory-diet-benefits-tips/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a38148129/anti-inflammatory-diet-benefits-tips/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="anti-inflammatory diet" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;anti-inflammatory diet&lt;/a&gt;.” But the eating regimen doesn’t need such a formal title (#marketing). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;This diet doesn’t have one specific outline, but more generally includes foods that support the body by providing the vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that keep our systems working properly, says Ginger Hultin, RDN, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="body-tip css-13fzjfi emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try this:&lt;/strong&gt; Living by basic nutritious eating rules—going hard in the produce aisle, dialing back on white bread—means your diet is on its way to being anti-inflammatory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-know-if-your-inflammation-levels-are-in-a-healthy-range" data-node-id="29" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;How To Know If Your Inflammation Levels Are In A Healthy Range&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;You can’t exactly see or feel chronic inflammation; it’s happening internally. So you may wonder if you need some sort of workup from an MD to scan for it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The answer: not if you’re healthy, says Dr. Shmerling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;There’s no easy, reliable way to know if heat is building, and the medical tests available are really meant for people with known risk factors for chronic illnesses associated with inflammation, like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. (The most common scan for inflammatory markers like these is the C-reactive protein test.) You don’t need a high-tech exam if you’re owning our advice and seeing a doc for your usual checkups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Women's Health</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNZ1Y4TlhKM3lXdmxzcFJLWXl1SDVFTW81czBsdTJYRGVtQjB4VGFBV3pBdi1ZM2RyNUdXSlhaeE1ZSG5BOFlYOVZUX3MtNHgydXVUMnk5b1ZJU09tcmZObE5HdEVKZmppZ2N6SHJhX0RsZjhYV2d4Um84SUJPbWdvNVVSUUlxTXdaMm5IVDREdHE3bUxnNnpib0RDU0NrM012NGtRTEFR</guid></item><item><title>The countries that never locked down for Covid-19 - BBC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQZDlLR0VnZkU0WkFKVnF4aE5oUmw2Ni1EMnctTEdldlhvUlBfSnJ2U1ZsQ3F0TGZKcG5oNkZXQ2xuRWoyNlhjendtTFNwRm8zZmNvZ2tFVnAzREtaTWhvZExKbmZXbmVJYkROMDZLdWF2bzM1YmNxZndhX05tUi1TTmZvMmI0WDM0akRLWmh6R3hkMTBNN0xCMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;Five years on: The countries that never locked down for Covid-19&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kw2b4z.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kw2b4z.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kw2b4z.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw2b4z.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kw2b4z.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kw2b4z.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kw2b4z.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kw2b4z.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kw2b4z.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw2b4z.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Alamy Pedestrians – some wearing face masks and others without – cross a road in Taiwan (Credit: Alamy)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Alamy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;(Credit: Alamy)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;b id="most-of-the-world-found-itself-confined-to-their-homes-in-march-2020-as-covid-19-spread-at-a-blistering-pace.-some-countries-didn't-impose-any-lockdown-restrictions-–-so-was-their-decision-the-right-one?" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Most of the world found itself confined to their homes in March 2020 as Covid-19 spread at a blistering pace.

It was a last-ditch attempt to curb the spread of a terrifying virus that had already killed &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/deaths?n=o" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;many thousands of people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In London, theatre worker Tony Beckingham and his partner decided to use their daily exercise to cycle into the centre of the city one evening. "We thought it'd be really fun to see no-one around," he says. It wasn't. Places the pair knew well, like Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square, perennially abuzz with people, were chillingly quiet. "It was really upsetting – instantly," says Beckingham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This deletion of the public from city streets, venues and businesses &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-52103747" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;first began in China&lt;/a&gt;, where Covid-19 emerged.

"We even have a dog-friendly cinema." As countries around the world, including Sweden's neighbours Norway, Finland and Denmark, ushered in national lockdowns in March 2020, Mc Manus was aware that her own government had &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52076293" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;decided to buck the trend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She heard how dog owners in some nations couldn't even take their pets out for walks because of lockdown rules. South Africa &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-52047374" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;was one such country&lt;/a&gt;. This struck Mc Manus as terrible. At the time, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://citydogexpert.com/the-covid-chronicles-dogenburg/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;she wrote a blog post&lt;/a&gt; in which she said, "I am convinced that my government is acting in a secure and correct way". However, she also expressed concern that her fellow Swedes were not always following the official &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7537539/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;public health guidelines around social distancing&lt;/a&gt;, such as limiting the number of people who could meet together in a group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mc Manus remembers taking frequent walks in beauty spots, but also that she and her colleagues continually wore masks &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200504-coronavirus-what-is-the-best-kind-of-face-mask" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;to help prevent Covid-19 transmission&lt;/a&gt; at the veterinary hospital where she worked in 2020. Plus, she and her partner avoided restaurants and meeting up with lots of other people. Even now, Mc Manus says she is not sure what to make of Sweden's official strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I want to base it on facts – like how many people died," she says.

But while excess mortality fell in the three other countries in 2020, it rose compared to Sweden in 2021 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The four countries have a comparable number of excess deaths when you account for the fact that population sizes differ," says Forthun. What lockdowns did affect, in part, was the timing of when spikes in excess deaths occurred. Of Norway's approach, Forthun adds: "We probably kept some older and vulnerable people alive for a longer period." Whereas authorities in Sweden &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55347021" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;were criticised in 2020&lt;/a&gt; over high numbers of deaths at care homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some economists have combined similar data with comparisons of economic performance indicators between the same four Nordic countries to argue that, overall, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecaf.12611" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Sweden's approach was justified&lt;/a&gt; due to the relatively low economic costs. But such arguments are controversial and the lack of a lockdown in Sweden remains an area for heated debate among some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;One Swedish epidemiologist, Nele Brusselaers, of the Karolinska Institute, has criticised her country's Covid-19 strategy. She moved to Belgium during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I'm a medical doctor so of course I care about lives," she says. "We want to save every single life." She says many of her fellow Swedes are "still in denial" about Covid-19 though some have come to question the lack of lockdown in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Brusselaers, who lived in Sweden in 2020, notes how her posts about Covid-19 on social media resulted in fierce pushback from some who disagreed with her stance on lockdown as an appropriate strategy. "You get so much hatred," she says. "That's not something I was used to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Sweden's approach to controlling the virus contrasted dramatically with that of its neighbours in the early stages of the pandemic (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Sweden's approach to controlling the virus contrasted dramatically with that of its neighbours in the early stages of the pandemic (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Even today, some people find it hard to move past the hostility they faced on the topic of lockdowns. One university researcher approached by the BBC for this article said they were so traumatised by the abuse they received online in 2020 that they never intended to comment on Covid-19 control measures, or lockdowns, publicly again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Furthermore, some people who lived in countries without lockdowns, and who disagreed with their government's approach, are still reeling from the experience. Tanzania never had any Covid-19 lockdowns. The country's former &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56412912" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;President, John Magufuli&lt;/a&gt;, who dismissed lockdowns and other public health interventions, died &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-56437852" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Magufuli's approach to the pandemic was "unscientific", says history lecturer Fadhili Mtani at the Muslim University of Morogoro in Tanzania. "He advocated for &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-52519853" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;traditional herbs&lt;/a&gt; and later he &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55900680" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;rejected vaccines&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But Mtani recalls visiting hospitals where members of his own family had passed away of an illness. "I saw people suffocating in the hospitals," he says. "The hospital said we should not say it's Covid." Official figures suggest &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/tanzania" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;around 840 people have died of Covid-19 in Tanzania&lt;/a&gt; since the start of the pandemic. Mtani says that the government has not made accurate statistics available, however. An international collaboration aimed at &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02796-3/fulltext" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;estimating the global excess deaths&lt;/a&gt; during the first two years of the pandemic has put the total number of deaths in Tanzania at somewhere between 102,000-188,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mtani argues that Tanzania should have enforced a lockdown, though without placing excessive restrictions on the movement of workers. "The majority of people are poor. To deny movement for them is to deny their existence," Mtani explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Many scientists emphasise that lockdowns were crucial for saving lives in the early part of the pandemic, before vaccines were available, and also for limiting the pressure on health services. By March 2020, this pressure was already severe in the UK, says Adam Kucharski, professor of infectious disease epidemiology, at the London School of Hygiene &amp;amp; Tropical Medicine. "The NHS was overwhelmed," Kucharski explains, referring to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/26/doctor-in-tears-at-covid-inquiry-says-what-nhs-staff-saw-was-indescribable" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;emotional testimony of doctors&lt;/a&gt; who have spoken to the UK's public inquiry into the government’s Covid-19 response. "It's ridiculous to suggest [the NHS] wasn't under effectively breaking pressure by that point," adds Kucharski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Kucharski also says that, because of the UK's global connections and the large number of young people who live together &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/more-young-people-in-the-uk-are-living-with-parents-and-grandparents-heres-what-you-need-to-know-if-youre-considering-it-216280" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;or with their parents&lt;/a&gt; compared &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190821-why-so-many-young-swedes-live-alone" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;to Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, for example, it might have been much harder for the UK to control Covid-19 transmission without imposing a lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He also points to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abd9338" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;a 2021 study&lt;/a&gt; that attempted to quantify the effect of specific government interventions on the spread of Covid-19, using data from 41 countries. It reveals that certain aspects of national lockdowns might have been more impactful than others. The researchers found, for example, that banning gatherings of more than 10 people or closing schools and universities was especially effective, reducing transmission by more than 35% on average. Shutting restaurants and bars seemed to make slightly less difference to transmission, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;What's more, the researchers suggest that adding a strict stay-at-home order on top of such measures "only had a small additional effect" in terms of slowing down Covid-19 – estimated at below 17.5% on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images The effects of Tanzania's early response to Covid-19 is still not visible in the official government statistics (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;The effects of Tanzania's early response to Covid-19 is still not visible in the official government statistics (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Countries that chose not to lock down severely may also have had more time to prepare for the arrival of Covid-19, or social and structural reasons as to why the Sars-CoV-2 virus was less likely to spread quickly there versus other nations. Even then, there are surprising comparisons to be made. Take Iceland and New Zealand, for instance. Both are wealthy island nations with relatively small populations but while New Zealand introduced &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://nzhistory.govt.nz/page/new-zealand-enters-nationwide-lockdown-fight-against-covid-19" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;a strict lockdown on 25 March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, Iceland never did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"They [Iceland] had more of a mitigation strategy," says Leah Grout, a research data analyst specialising in public health at the Southern California University of Health Sciences. Grout was &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14034948221149143" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;lead author on a research paper&lt;/a&gt; about the contrasting Covid-19 strategies and outcomes of these two countries. Iceland introduced &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.stjornarradid.is/efst-a-baugi/frettir/stok-frett/?NewsId=c65cf658-6eb6-11ea-9462-005056bc4d74" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;a test and trace programme&lt;/a&gt;, in which infections and contacts between people were monitored so that individuals – rather than entire populations – were asked to observe quarantine for a time. This measure was also used in many countries that also applied lockdowns, when those lockdowns were lifted. Iceland had some restrictions on social gatherings and it did &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-56412790" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;close its borders to some travellers&lt;/a&gt;, briefly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"New Zealand had one of the lowest mortality rates globally with their approach," says Grout. "Iceland also fared pretty well." Plus, the economic impacts on both countries were limited, she adds.

But, in retrospect, that seems much too early to come to any real conclusions. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/uruguay-quietly-beats-coronavirus-distinguishing-itself-from-its-south-american-neighbors-yet-again-140037" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Uruguay was lauded at the time&lt;/a&gt; for apparently managing to keep Covid-19 at bay, despite never enacting a strict lockdown. The country's government enforced some forms of social distancing, including the closure of some gyms, and Uruguay's borders were also &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cesam.org/documents/CESAM-COVID19-OVERVIEW-WEEK_2021_04.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;closed to certain travellers&lt;/a&gt;, for instance. But ports remained open and there was no stay-at-home order affecting the entire population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kw2b8z.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kw2b8z.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kw2b8z.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw2b8z.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kw2b8z.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kw2b8z.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kw2b8z.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kw2b8z.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kw2b8z.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw2b8z.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Alamy The relative economic, social and public health benefits of lockdowns are still being debated five years after the pandemic began (Credit: Alamy)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Alamy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;The relative economic, social and public health benefits of lockdowns are still being debated five years after the pandemic began (Credit: Alamy)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.demographic-research.org/articles/volume/51/29/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;A study published in 2024 found that&lt;/a&gt;, while excess deaths were low in Uruguay during 2020, they actually rose substantially in 2021 and 2022. Excess deaths in 2021, for example, were nearly 19% above the expected figure, based on historical trends. The study's authors put this down mostly to the spread of Covid-19 but add that impacts from the pandemic on the ability to provide healthcare in other ways probably also played a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Similarly, Japan was able to keep mortality from Covid-19 to a relatively low level in the early part of the pandemic. By the summer of 2022, Covid-19 &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jogh.org/2022/jogh-12-03073" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;deaths had reached 36,200&lt;/a&gt;. Today, they stand &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/15587088" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;at 130,000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some researchers argue that Japan’s approach proved to be the right one overall. "Even without lockdown, suppression of epidemic curves has been largely successful," argues Hiroshi Nishiura, a professor in the graduate school of medicine at Kyoto University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Despite this, Yasuharu Tokuda, a clinical epidemiologist and director of the Muribushi Okinawa Center for Teaching Hospitals in Okinawa, Japan, argues that a tougher approach might have been beneficial. "Some patients could not be admitted to the hospital because of the lack of available beds," he says. "If we have a strong viral pandemic, then we need to have a stricter lockdown in Japan." Research suggests that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-024-18866-3" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;there might be resistance to such an idea&lt;/a&gt; among members of the public in Japan, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;I became quite introverted and now I find I don't want to interact with people as much as I did before – Bill Allison&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It is important to reflect on just how drastic a measure lockdown really is. Kucharski, for one, calls it a "blunt" tool. "We should never have got to that point where we were in so much trouble, with so little visibility of what the pandemic was doing," he says. It was due to a lack of certainty over what would happen next, and a dearth of other interventions on the table, that the UK was more or less forced into lockdown, he suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Many have still not got over the effects of lockdown. In March 2020, Bill Allison, a former civil servant in Scotland, was in his mid-60s. He had many plans for his retirement – he wanted to see the world. Back then, Allison was also an avid pub-goer who frequently met up with his friends for a pint. Lockdown stopped him in his tracks. He says he followed the rules at all times but this left him feeling a profound sense of loneliness and isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I gathered up all the scraps of wood that I had and decided to see if I could make them into an electric guitar," he says. "I would work late at night. There was nothing else to do, really." He found a guitar-making group online, through which he met people with similar interests. "I made quite a lot of new friends."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But when the world gradually began to open up again, Allison was struck by a strong sense of what he had been missing and was hard to regain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The pub near me, it's nothing like as busy as it was before Covid," he says. "I became quite introverted and now I find I don't want to interact with people as much as I did before. I was discussing it with a few of my friends. […] We all feel very unhappy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Soon to turn 72, Allison says his pre-pandemic travel plans remain on hold. "I'm kind of getting to the age where I don't really want to do a nine-hour flight to the other side of the world anymore. It's kind of knocked me back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kw2b9m.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kw2b9m.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kw2b9m.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw2b9m.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kw2b9m.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kw2b9m.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kw2b9m.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kw2b9m.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kw2b9m.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw2b9m.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images The long-term effects of the pandemic lockdowns on children whose education was disrupted have yet to be fully understood (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;The long-term effects of the pandemic lockdowns on children whose education was disrupted have yet to be fully understood (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Authorities in some countries that attempted to enforce strict lockdowns and a "zero Covid" policy were greeted with violent protests from members of the public.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers from China, Japan, and the US have 3D-printed a full penile system using a hydrogel-based model. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bioengineered component designed to imitate a portion of the penis was implanted into rabbits and pigs diagnosed with penile deformities, and the outcomes were remarkable. The penile implants enabled the rabbits and pigs to mate and reproduce biologically within weeks after the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-overcoming-the-challenges-of-vascularization"&gt;Overcoming the challenges of vascularization&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most complex organs in the human body require an intricate vascular system for the tissue to function. In the penis, this network plays a crucial role in achieving an erection, as blood must flow into the corpora cavernosa and remain trapped to maintain rigidity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team devised a hydrogel-based model that consists of the corpora cavernosa, corpus spongiosum, and the tunica albuginea sheath. It enabled the monitoring of integral aspects of the genital organ, its vasculature, and any potential defects without the necessity of actual human or animal trials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team specifically aimed to develop a model to study erectile dysfunction and Peyronie’s disease, a condition where scar tissue causes painful and curved erections. By replicating how blood engorges the corpora cavernosa and how cavernous sinuses function as valves to maintain an erection, the model provided valuable insights into the mechanisms behind these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-successful-prosthesis-implantation-and-further-expectations"&gt;Successful prosthesis implantation and further expectations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test its efficacy, the researchers designed a more advanced version of the model that was implanted with endothelial cells, the cells that line the &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/culture/james-harrison-australian-blood-donor-dies" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;blood &lt;/a&gt;vessels. The engineered tissue was implanted into rabbits and pigs with penile vascular malformations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks, the animals showed restoration of erectile function and were subsequently observed copulating and reproducing. This marked an important advance in the field of regenerative medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These findings underscore the potential clinical applications of biomimetic corpus cavernosum (BCC) for the treatment of penile injuries. Furthermore, this study advances the clinical application of &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/3d-printing-of-bendable-concrete" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;3D-printed&lt;/a&gt; artificial tissue organs,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Printing biological tissues seems to be the latest technological advancement in tissue engineering. Based on the progress made in bioprinting, Eindhoven University of Technology has &lt;a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/news-and-events/news-overview/27-02-2025-3d-printing-living-tissue-with-light-takes-a-leap-forward" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;pioneered&lt;/a&gt; the use of a light-based 3D printing technique called xolography for living cell structures. This advancement may help in the manufacturing of complex biological tissues like muscles and kidneys, which may bring regenerative medicine closer to reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Xolography is based on the principle of employing two or more intersecting light beams to solidify a liquid polymer. The Eindhoven team has advanced this technique to print structures up to 20 microns in size which is the approximate size of a human cell. In combination with other techniques, this can lead to further advances in tissue engineering. However, this tech is currently still in the prototype phase. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study has been published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01367-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They are present everywhere, including the human brain. A recent paper in Nature Medicine found that the human brain contains approximately a spoon's worth of microplastics and nanoplastics (MNPs); brain tissues were found to have 7–30 times higher amounts of MNPs than other organs such as the liver or kidney. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A commentary report published in the Brain Medicine journal has shed light on the growing menace of microplastics, the health consequences that are likely to show up and the measures that can be taken for remedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The current evidence base (largely based upon animal and cell culture studies) suggests that MNP exposure can lead to adverse health impacts via oxidative stress, inflammation, immune dysfunction, altered biochemical/energy metabolism, impaired cell proliferation, abnormal organ development, disrupted metabolic pathways, and carcinogenicity," the researchers have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Particularly, a recent study in The New England Journal of Medicine found that people with a carotid artery plaque in which MNPs were detected had a higher risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or all-cause mortality (5). Additionally, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients' stool contained about 1.5 times more microplastics than healthy controls, averaging 41.8 vs. 28.0 particles per gram of dry stool," they have said in the report highlighting a study on mice where mice exposed to nanoplastics for 8 weeks led to learning and memory deficits, lower levels of synaptic proteins, and neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists have urged to "reduce the most significant sources of microplastic intake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Switching from bottled water to tap water could reduce microplastic intake from 90,000 to 4,000 particles per year, making it an impactful intervention," they have suggested. "Stopping the practice of heating food in plastic could be one of the most effective ways to reduce microplastic consumption."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Limiting canned food consumption and opting for non-plastic or BPA-free packaged alternatives can effectively reduce exposure," the researchers have said and have added, "Highly processed foods, like chicken nuggets, contained 30 times more microplastics per gram than chicken breasts, highlighting the impact of industrial processing, which often uses plastics at some point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to reduce microplastics in daily life&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Avoid using bottled water&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use a high-quality water filter (such as one with activated carbon or reverse osmosis) at home. Opt for glass, stainless steel, or BPA-free reusable bottles instead of plastic bottles.

Then there are the horror stories about thyroid &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-f4b91e80-f94f-11ef-9561-93fcab9b5784"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, pancreatitis, stomach paralysis and blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now experts and patients fear they have uncovered a new risk: deafness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Slimmers on the drug are reporting severe problems including painful ringing sounds, disorientating muffled noises and, in the most extreme cases, full blown hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some doctors believe they may have worked out what is behind these alarming symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking to the Daily Mail, New Jersey-based audiology consultant Dr Robert DiSogra says the issues being reported could be the result of a loss of fat in the ear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sudden and rapid weight-loss can cause the fatty tissue surrounding the Eustachian tubes, that connect your ears to the back of your throat, to shrink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ozempic patients are complaining of hearing issues after taking the medication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can cause the tubes to stay open when they should be shut, and ultimately result in the hearing issues being reported by those on Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tony Floyd, who is based in New South Wales, Australia, says he had one patient whose Eustachian tubes stayed open all the time after they lost a substantial amount of weight using Ozempic. He says their symptoms included the 'sensation of pressure and muffled hearing in one ear'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston explain that when hearing tubes stay open due to a loss of fat, 'it allows sounds to be transmitted directly to the middle ear.' This condition is known as patulous or patent eustachian tube dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with ringing sounds and muffled hearing, they warn that patients could also experience autophony - which is when you hear self-generated sounds such as your breathing, voice or heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They advise: ‘Treatment includes avoiding triggers such as caffeine consumption (or a decreasing the amount), rehydration during vigorous exercise, or changing hormonal therapy. If medical treatment fails or symptoms recur, surgery to correct or modify the opening of the eustachian tube might be necessary.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic was originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, by lowering blood sugar levels. Diabetes can be genetic – known as type 1 diabetes, but around three quarters of the 38.4 million cases in the US are type 2 and caused by poor diet and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After studies revealed the drug - which falls into the category of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist (GLP-1s) injections - was a highly effective appetite-suppressant, the weekly injections were repurposed to treat weight-loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2018, 92 percent of new Ozempic users had been diagnosed with diabetes. By 2021, this had fallen to 77 percent and continues to decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research suggests patients taking Ozempic - which contains an active ingredient called semaglutide – can lose up to 15 per cent of their body weight within a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those taking another GLP-1 drug, called Mounjaro, lose as much as a fifth of their body weight over the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;New Jersey-based audiology consultant Dr Robert DiSogra said the issues being reported could be the result of a loss of fat in the ear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, there are risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around a fifth of people who take weight-loss injections suffer from nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. For most, these issues fade after several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of greater concern are reports of pancreatitis. This causes inflammation of the pancreas, an organ in the abdomen which produces digestive hormones. In some cases, pancreatitis can be life-threatening and trigger organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, a study carried out by researchers at Harvard University last year concluded that taking Ozempic doubles the risk of a rare condition called non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, or NAION.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This medical emergency occurs when blood flow to the nerves of the eye becomes blocked, causing vision loss. But despite the increased risk, the condition is still thought to only occur in one in every 4,000 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are not yet any official warnings about hearing problems associated with Ozempic. But patients in online support groups are increasingly raising the alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Some experts said there is no solid evidence to support Ozempic-induced tinnitus or hearing loss and claim the incidents are very rare&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One Facebook user, Anna Helms, revealed that after taking an Ozempic shot, her tinnitus would 'flare up bad for a few days', while dozens of others say they developed the condition for the first after taking the weight loss drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ken Myers, from Pennsylvania, said he experienced a 'loud ringing' in his ears, along with many other side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Dahlia Presley wrote in a Facebook group: 'First time today and immediately after I had my Ozempic shot I started feeling a terrible migraine for the past four hours and it's getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My head is throbbing and I hear a loud ringing in my ears!! Someone please help... Is this a bad side effect? My head feels like it's gonna explode.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On Reddit, there are similar complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Redditor Lindainthemountains wrote: 'I have been taking Ozempic for one month and have lost 7lbs. I love finally having control over my eating after over 30 years of trying every diet ever invented! I had the usual gastrointestinal issues the first two weeks, but those passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But I still have ringing in my ears and a weird taste in my mouth immediately after an injection.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a bid to stop the ringing in her ears, the Redditor said she cut her Ozempic doses in half and that seemed to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One Redditor said that along with 'pretty bad' tinnitus, they were also hit by 'very mild hearing loss' after using Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Angie Dugdale, a singer based in Utah, says she experienced the sensation of pressure and muffled hearing in one ear after taking Ozempic for diabetes. She says the issue is now so severe, she can no longer sing.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the complaints, some experts claim there is no solid evidence to support Ozempic-induced tinnitus or hearing loss and stressed that incidents are very rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also highlighted that diabetes itself can cause nerve damage in the ears, which can lead to hearing loss and therefore could be behind the reported problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Leonard A. Jason, a professor at DePaul University, Chicago, says he has 'not seen any evidence in reputable outlets that would support this as a side effect of the medication'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dietician Carolyn Williams adds: 'I've seen this claim made over the past few months and noticed that it seemed to pop back up recently. An increased risk of hearing loss is associated with numerous medications, but, to date, I have not seen evidence that hearing loss is a side effect of taking semaglutide drugs like Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For most people, the health benefits that semaglutide drugs provide significantly outweigh the risks based on current research.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Healthy Hearing, the largest hearing-focused consumer website, said Ozempic and other anti-obesity GLP-1 agonists like Mounjaro and Zepbound 'do not appear to cause hearing problems, although there have been sporadic case reports of problems discussed on internet forums like Reddit'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Daily Mail has contacted Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic, for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 07:14:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNcHFnN3RTWE5FQnZRT0FvNDg4dFRubnlQb0V1aXRnR1ZXQW9GbWRrdTVqSUo0b0VydU9GWk81bzR2R3N2YVNCYjlrdkFLNXpzTUNITjRpc2tWZmtQMkNDSmc1LTI3NHJFblAxTkFoNDRjRnZQX3JnaW9RdTNjdUpuOGt2MGdKN194cEI2SElfbkg3UFFRNWJ2SGxiVTR6YXNVZEJxdg</guid></item></channel></rss>
